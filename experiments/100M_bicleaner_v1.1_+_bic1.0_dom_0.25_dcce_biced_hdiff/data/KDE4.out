package &amp; package ; contains various modules for and kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making these easier to access .
more information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select Settings extensions .... Open the box card tools and select the modules you want .
this is a list of default setting modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons package . please note that possibly more modules are on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; it contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Tools crashes . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crashes , if present .
the module In@@ visible filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras address filter . with the module you can filter and kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current directory of work in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to use , select Tools DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed page . as default , the display starts with the root node of the document , for example : document@@ s.com , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
the feature of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of mapping wa@@ xed folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called tree map . tree @-@ Maps allow representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose area is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the child &apos;s subordin@@ ate objects is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
for &amp; FS@@ View , the size of a file or folder shows the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files , even then easily detected , can be easily detected if they are far below in the folder hierarchy . accordingly , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of &amp; UNIX ; -@@ command can be considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap is a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation use the rec@@ tan@@ gles useful color and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over view color mode , can be either depth for easy recognition of the ne@@ sting depth or the representation of another file feature such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ elled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether there is enough space to display , or whether the area of sub@@ class rec@@ tan@@ gles is to be used . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rect@@ angle .
for Tre@@ em@@ aps the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this target is not always comp@@ lied with . it is drawn frame to indicate the ne@@ sting of the entries , and this frame will need space , which is then lost to the subordin@@ ate entries .
how to partition the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . in this case , it is always advantageous for the lab@@ eling and avoid@@ ance of space loss by frame to create rec@@ tan@@ gles that are as square as possible . the best methods in this respect are rows , columns or recur@@ rent sec@@ tioning .
you can set the minimum displayed area for an entry above the menu entry View An@@ stop on area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent item in order to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally , &amp; FS@@ View was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get designed for the application of K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
the picture gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras picture gallery ... or with C@@ trl + I .
when you visit the gallery picture gallery , a dialog opens with which you can set the image of the gallery .
the Tit@@ le of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the option images per line has a sli@@ der and a turn@@ table to set the number of thumb@@ nails in each line in the gallery .

to include the sub@@ folder with the check box , you can set the sub@@ folders to which level the sub@@ folders are included .
copy the original images to the gallery to see if the original images are to be copied to the gallery .
using the comment file check@@ box , you can specify a comment file for cap@@ tioning the images in the gallery .
in the check box sel@@ ector color depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original pictures .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ settings gives you easy access to general &amp; HTML ; -@@ settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ Photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; includes fast image editing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can be easily extended with K@@ DE Image Cre@@ ate Interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ cam ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works complete in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion by li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC color management workflow .
improved database with significantly more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or the lens to be searched for .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also digi@@ ti@@ zed ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of end users . therefore , they should report trouble and improvement opportunities .
whenever you are in the program , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . all the information you need is entered here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; is a project that is supported by a community . that is , the user and developer can help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , we would like to encourage you to answer questions other users of &amp; digi@@ kam . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
you can also visit the digi@@ cam ; homepage to visit news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam .
the best start to join &amp; digi@@ kam ; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for signing in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when you first start , you will be asked where to save your images and your database . you can specify a local , remote or removable folder . simply enter the path name or click the Fol@@ der icon Fol@@ der icon to select a folder .
in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data extraction is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ cam ; will additionally be used as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek .
if you already have a collection of images on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder that contains images as the base folder . &amp; digi@@ cam ; view any sub@@ folder as an album . no image will be modified .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; dur@@ st recur@@ sively re@@ itali@@ zes the library path in its entire depth . you cannot exclude any sub@@ folders , unless it is in hidden folder . you can do this by adding a point before the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste do not have any photos as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon . this will then be used as an album icon . for more details , see the Album section .
once you have configured the base folder , you can be in &amp; digi@@ cam ; set up your digital camera . then you should learn how to use My Albums and My C@@ riteri@@ a to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , it &apos;s possible to handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the help of Roh@@ k@@ amer@@ a@@ Backup .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ Photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera then appears as a disk drive . the camera then appears as a disk drive . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , distributed software collection for digital cameras , which supports an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol developed by the International Ima@@ ging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and transfers over the serial port are slow , this connection is now obsol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ cam ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to reliably read the thumb@@ nails by digi@@ K@@ am . if the ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , thumb@@ nails may not be seen or the creation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things on &amp; digi@@ cam ; is how easy it is to expand its functionality by modul@@ ating modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphic programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as a user can . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ kam ; by writing a small module to complete a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam ; themselves perform .
to simplify the window , you can either strip the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB , or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 respectively C@@ trl + Shift + F .
drawing and dropping pictures works everywhere : you can place an image in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ms , above the horizontal dividing line or into another application window . the only limitation is that an image cannot be stored in keywords , data list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . thus , filtering on the fil@@ en@@ ame only works if this is displayed in the symbol view . which fields can be displayed in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ Setup .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ pi@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard disk , by the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ thic properties or after the date on which the album was first created .
if you have created a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also scan an album Im@@ por@@ tieren images . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album .
to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it . in the then appearing menu , you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all photos and move them to the destination album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album properties , right click on the album and select the album Properties contex@@ tual menu .
album collections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection set by you will be used to sort your photos by selecting the collection from the toolbar or view albums by collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do so in the collections for collections .
the Alb@@ um@@ - Date : used when you sort your albums by date with View Album sorting by date .
the oldest , average , ne@@ sts : these set the date to the oldest , the newest picture or that of the average section of the album . to do this , first attempt to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , instead , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder .
when you first record an album in &amp; digi@@ kam , the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ pi@@ quot ; this should help you to remember the photos on the album . sometimes the first photo on the album is not representative and you may then choose another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as Album icon , click the image with the right mouse button and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; As an album preview , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can only be included in a collection and collections can &apos;t be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; support the input of keywords for single photos in the section My keyword list at the bottom of the main window . album collections have a different effect . to the collection are always all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window will provide you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all the images in this album will be displayed in the image window . each photo will be displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of these thumb@@ nails with the two lou@@ pe buttons in the toolbar .
when you open an album for the first time , you have to wait a while while the thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid this by using all thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu .
information on each image is displayed below the respective thumb@@ nail . what information this is , you can change settings by editing . select the albums page here and customize the thumb@@ nail area to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . if you leave the mouse cursor over a picture for a moment , the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the introduction to the main window displays such help window .
photos are all about digi@@ kam . albums and keywords allows you to organize your pictures as you like . image editing shows your photos and allows you to perform a number of improvements on them . you can view all the functions that are made with &amp; digi@@ cam ; you can choose between viewing the images , a slide show or editing the images .
you can open the image editing with a photo by selecting either F@@ 4 image processing ... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing ... . in the Edit pane ; image editing you will find a guide on how to edit your photos . with image processing , you can view your photos and change them .
it may happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by using the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of Open . for this , and how to adjust it to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after processing other image editing programs , problems with the metadata contained in the image may occur . some programs do not store these data with when you save the changed image . therefore , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture , etc .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way to view and rotate it with the right mouse button . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , right click the thumb@@ nail and select F2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you will retain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam , it will be moved into the bin of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 image dele@@ tion or Del if you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift + Del .
&amp; quot ; My date list ; organizes your photos using the data . &amp; digi@@ cam ; used for either the EX@@ IF date or if this is not available , the date of the last modification of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date page at the bottom of the date view to show you only the photos of the selected days .
photos with keyword provides a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . keywords are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by choosing this keyword or a search again .
if a keyword is selected , all photos that have been marked with this keyword will be displayed .
keywords can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to lo@@ gically organize your keywords . you can also fold sections of the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords , so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . you can also use your keywords in other programs .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking either on &amp; quot ; My keyword , or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing keyword , this becomes the sub@@ stit@@ ch@@ word of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by dra@@ gging it to the desired position in the tree and put it there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to post@@ p@@ one the keyword . a keyword can only be in the tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting the keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword ; change .
to select another photo as Album icon , click the image with the right mouse button and select as a Album preview in the context menu . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
as soon as you have selected the photos you want to use with a keyword , you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword , drag and drop it . alternatively , you can also right @-@ click on the thumb@@ nail of the images and select the keywords from the context menu .
you can add a photo with any number of keywords . the picture will be displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way you can set a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event where it was made , etc .
once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will be displayed in the main window under the preview of the image .
you can remove a keyword by right @-@ clicking the photo &apos;s context menu and selecting Rem@@ ove from the keywords menu . the menu only shows the keywords assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view displays a tim@@ ately adjustable hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection box can be moved using this hist@@ ogram . to select a tim@@ eline , you only have to click on the bottom rect@@ angle of the selection frame , which displays the time unit . this will display all associated images in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection , which will appear in the list below .
cover all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and more in the future .
next he search box is a small lamp that becomes green when the search finds matches . if you click here the filtering is deleted and all images are displayed again . if the search has not found , then the lamp becomes red .
the advanced search tool is hidden in the tab on the left side bar with bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open it you will see a simple search box as described above . you can search this search here but as a live search , which always filters what you typ@@ ed as a search criterion . after saving it , he will filter in the list .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press OK and the search is performed . the results will be displayed in the My Search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after the search , you only need to select the corresponding entry from the view My search list and select an option in its context menu .
when you select search , the search form returns with the previously entered search information . if you choose to edit an advanced search , the Advanced search dialog appears to change your previous search . more information can be found in the section The Tools for Advanced Search .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete in the Search context menu .
advanced Search provides you with an advanced search form with many search parameters that you can search for in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ database . all rules are automatically added to the search group / search group can be added or deleted from it . each option can be linked to other via the logical operations All ... , One ... , N@@ one ... or at least ... create .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; character@@ izes every image by a long number with a special technique called the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two image signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop each image to find a similar one . if you move an image from somewhere over the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar then it will open and you can drop it there .
sket@@ ch : free @-@ hand color sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and &amp; digi@@ cam ; finds the suitable pictures . also here , a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can zoom in or zoom in with the mouse wheel or hold it and move it . move it while clicking the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this assumes , of course , that your pictures contain ge@@ o data .
in the field below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o @-@ filter , which will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live @-@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides a lumin@@ aire in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L Add to the lumin@@ aire from the context menu . the selection will be added to the light table and its window is opened .
from the preview bar you can drag and drop the images you want to compare in the left or right area of the window . a small arrow indicates which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you select preview from the toolbar and carry out zoo and deportation operations on one of the images , you will also be able to compare the same area of both pictures .
another mode is better suited for sorting out quickly from a series of images . if you use combination mode from the toolbar , the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas to compare . use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to view it on the left . this makes it easy to work through a series of similar images .
of course , the normal dele@@ tion actions also work directly from the lumin@@ aire like F@@ 4 file ...
all image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both preview images in the illuminated table . this makes it easy for example to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each section you will find a built @-@ in pi@@ voting function that you can see on the crossed arrows . to pi@@ v@@ ot the visible area of the image , you must click on it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB . in the preview button , both pictures will show the same image area .
the zoom works as well as in other views . simply use the Zoom knob under the pictures or C@@ trl key to zoom in and out . this happens in both pictures when you are in preview mode .
digital Stock Management considers every part of the process following after the image has been taken up to the final output and the permanent storage . each of the photos records , scans or stores digital photos performs a form of digital stock management . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient manner .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up , find , protect and use photos . we focus on the procedures for digital photographers the &amp; digi@@ cam ; use . we consider downloading , ren@@ aming , removing , converting , group@@ ing , backing , optimizing , waiting and export of image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory management records , inde@@ xes , categ@@ ori@@ zes , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , conf@@ ec@@ tioned and exports contents that have a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is data that provides information about or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
I dare to say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer then you will need no longer to find a specific photo without inventory management . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then use certainly not &amp; digi@@ kam ; . the approach to store the metadata in both a database and in the image files ensures very fast searches and a secure archiving which you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you get anything into your system is the structure information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you need to decide whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive , etc .
you may be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can be quickly found on your location unless you were in one year several times the same place . the rest of the photos will be organized on the basis of your date . if you do have enough photos then you will be sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc .
professional photographers have other requirements , e.g. version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant import@@ ation of pictures on different subjects and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and work files simpli@@ fies backup strategy and migration . you will always know whether you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative image .
we also recommend to save the metadata option in the settings page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ kam . this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written to the file . if you forget it , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database to the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what ? to do this , &amp; digi@@ kam , providing them with a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work begins , as you should now assign templates , cap@@ tions and a rating to each photo . of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos while working .
now let &apos;s start with keywords , keywords , as you often say in other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically set the tree for you or insert the images to the right place . the sorting of the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by pulling one sub@@ tree to another .
the graph shows how different metadata is overl@@ apping . this is a very crude representation , since each block of metadata exists in truth from many sections . file names and calendar dates are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you don &apos;t want to let anybody see your photos just , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies .
look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you that this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you start dre@@ aming to have associations , memories , the historical period is back present , you may even hear the silence .
for others looking at your photos , the title may be more important than the picture itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to convey the meaning to the viewer , to help him about the subject you moved has to understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can store any amount of text , in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , as a label . if you export your images in web galleries , these labels will be exported to your wishes in the lab@@ eling and / or the title of the web gallery system .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without a navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Google Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of spatial presentation is now already at speed of light .
the possibilities of using ge@@ olo@@ cation are countless and will become even deeper in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your trips using images with geographic data . &amp; digi@@ cam ; can also export k@@ ml files that you can open with Goo@@ gle@@ Maps . you can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with Google Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a p@@ un with copyright and den@@ otes the use of copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms are also valid in all changed versions , thus also for the work of others .
the following description tells you what information in the furnishings page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; as information should be stored :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization may not be changed .
author &apos;s title : linked to the author . this field contains the photographer &apos;s job title . examples of this may be titles such as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer works for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organisations can be listed here , which you provide the image to others .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they offer no protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator can delete or modify the metadata embedded in the image . for individuals this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique for each picture . &amp; digi@@ cam ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you even in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section it &apos;s about problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery shop , has some interesting statistics which reasons have a data loss .
in order to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , these must be handled carefully and you can &apos;t trust you for more than a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality , which last longer , get harder and considerably more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for yourself .
CD / DVD disks can be un@@ readable but you can reduce this risk by using good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest ones , but you write much more reliable .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors even when they have just been written . therefore , they use a control sum mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data is only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control sums . despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently works miracles in CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and Linux , but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read corrupt data from damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to win the format war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that was said to CDs and DVDs is also true for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slowly with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ated format . then read the media with a description , date &amp; author mark and store them on a clean , dark dry and protected spot . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that this media can read .
Disk@@ manufacturers are keeping your statistics for themselves . their manufacturers &apos; warran@@ ties include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : disc@@ ard study
the most common error reason , S@@ MA@@ RT is the most common error reason , S@@ MA@@ RT cannot detect these errors . some errors identified by S@@ MA@@ RT indicate the im@@ minent failure . these are in particular read errors and shift counter@@ s . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you backup the files , but these losses can usually be restored without any major problems .
while most electrical devices do not matter much , it looks different on devices with computer chips and high speed processes . these can cause serious damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause blocked key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware obsol@@ escence , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . therefore protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against power peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy heat and gro@@ unded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector bar .
if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to protecting against lightning strikes and thereby protecting the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used on your computer , you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected . some manufacturers also produce over@@ voltage cont@@ actors which also have a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a wear@@ able over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protecting against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs . some models even allow them to continue working until the current is running . if you buy a U@@ PS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as a over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is of interest .
keep in mind the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare it &apos;s security with the cost of avoiding these . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can cost you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it . finally , remember to always remember all cables before you go on vacation .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software . Google Shared Storage is another popular offer that allows you to store any amount of data .
they are compared to the hard drives at home however very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data about the comparatively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . therefore , it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are limited to photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your pictures in full resolution online . the professional version provides you more , in case of Fli@@ ck@@ r more . for $ 25 per year you get unlimited storage , which should be verified in reality first .
from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very safe . transmission errors are cleaned automatically thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory .
the diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all transfers are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . all of these errors remain und@@ et@@ ected until you some@@ day open a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise . nobody seems to have ever thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year .
Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk errors on a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leopard .
Oracle started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ f file system . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms used by Z@@ FS and is also available for Linux ; but it is not yet part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % for desktop systems . not@@ ebooks are already 50 % of the@@ fts .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it causes less damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; has long been si@@ ghted any more .
open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the wi@@ dened file systems . you will find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden interruption during surgery is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not saved completely before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft , and human error are the main causes of data loss .
digital cameras sensors are 1 @-@ 2 aperture setting from fundamental physical limits . meaning that while the technology continues to develop , there is a natural boundary for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit .
even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is worse . even DS@@ LR cameras have their limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DS@@ LR cameras have their limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard disk today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anyone responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected each year by a data loss . thus , secure your data according to a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous as the re@@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of disks or the res@@ izing of hard drives .
suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive daily . if , then one day , a flash hits you if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft accidents : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , disaster prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another benefit of physical separation : as said above , a common reason for losing data despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not available immediately , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
difference protection : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snapshot of two times : the complete backup and the last difference protection .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . it creates multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time at which such backup was made . this backup comes to a version@@ ing system the next with the exception that it is only scanned and not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have actually been changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security via ss@@ h .
backup important images right after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium .
this approach leaves you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you come up with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . in the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month .
themes : metadata , IP@@ TC stored in the image file , associated X@@ MP files , original retained , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ enting images and metadata , copying the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing devices , ... , use of the Internet .
so that valuable images survive the next 40 years , that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you have to consider all that is being said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate during the time passes . unfortunately , there is no other way to consider a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered on the basis of the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
so virtualization is available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your storage and security technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have included the scal@@ ability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . for * ni@@ x systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and reloc@@ ate it to a new disk :
check with the d@@ mes@@ g command if your new record was detected by the system , but do not app@@ end it .
&amp; dollars ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollars ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c + dollar ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ d@@ c # modify the size of the fs if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software that can read it , you can create it yourself . this task becomes easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market , so you shouldn &apos;t use it anymore .
P@@ NG has been developed as an open source standard that should replace the GIF . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ a data , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG may store gam@@ ma@@ - and chro@@ mati@@ city data for enhanced color assignments for hetero@@ geneous platforms . the disadvantage is that there are relatively many administrative information but not as many as TI@@ FF and a slow compression .
TI@@ FF has been widely used as image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss @-@ free compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . it manages high @-@ quality images , but requires very large files . however , with some cameras you can store your images in this format .
D@@ NG The digital Neg@@ ative file format is a license @-@ free and open form format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG is developed on the basis of the need to uni@@ fy the camera file formats . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and committed to the use of metadata .
this is possibly one of the reasons why to replace 2001 , Adobe its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a coding technology that allows users to em@@ bed their data into a file itself .
many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in raw format . X@@ MP is suitable as it stores metadata separately from the image file . however , it may cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file , and as mentioned above , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything together there .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . the activities of D@@ C@@ MI include the work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enligh@@ tening efforts to achieve a wide @-@ ranging acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera edit , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them to your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
for fine editing you can use external programs . if you edit the images with &amp; Edit , then you should add the metadata again . these were probably cut off from the other programs .
protect the edited images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them to web galleries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam . in the Ad@@ ding a Photos to an album , you will find a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ Base .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , connect it to the computer , turn the camera to display mode and turn it on . a further description can be found in the hand@@ book of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect with your camera . if the connection is made , a fer@@ ous indicator will appear at the bottom end and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will appear . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for the application will be shown on the camera for any file , photos , movies , music , etc .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . you can view the properties of an item or its metadata with the properties and metadata from the camera interface .
this dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
this information is the same as with the metadata @-@ side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or image processing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is to click on the download button and then download the selection of all . this downloads all photos from their camera into a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam . . downloading the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were downloaded safely into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all the photos , you can only select the desired one with the default selection methods of &amp; k@@ de ; as soon as you have selected the photos , use the download button and then download the selected one . the selected download button is di@@ gest@@ ed until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , a New Download option is available . these images have not been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ kam . in this case , the new pictures will be marked with a star in the preview window . if you select this option , only the new pictures will be downloaded .
when you use the All Download or Sel@@ ected buttons , a dialog appears that allows you to select the target album in which the photos will be stored . the list of existing albums will be shown in the section My Albums . then select the destination album from the list and press OK .
after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ cam ; loads the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them at once by using the Del@@ ete All Del@@ ete button . if you just want to delete some , you need to select them first and then delete selected deleted ones .
please note that there is no way to recover photos that you deleted from the camera . you should not copy the photos into the garbage dump of &amp; k@@ de ; you should carefully check if the photos were successful in a &amp; digi@@ kam album , before you delete them from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera file , you should do this via the camera system , since this is much quicker .
cameras often do not use a particularly meaningful name for the photos . the file names are usually re@@ used after the photos are deleted from the camera . this can lead to double fil@@ en@@ ames in case you load photos from different shooting galleries into the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time on which the image was taken into the fil@@ en@@ ame .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based sub@@ directories . if you use this latter option , a folder will automatically be created per day .
during the transfer , three more options open before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two relate the data about the author in the standard auto ID section . if you select this , the corresponding entries from the ex@@ if information will be copied to the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
for example , if you want a different date format than the standard format , you can , for example , use the pre@@ fix photo@@ - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . for further adjustments , you should read the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the option camera fil@@ en@@ ame , you have the option to change the file names in lo@@ wer@@ case , or in upper case letters if you prefer .
the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ cam ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name the camera provides in preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to make automatic turn during loading . not all cameras provide this information . in the section Tool@@ bar metadata you can read more details about the information your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic turn is usually turned on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t deliver this information , it can be digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to disable automatic turn , use the Advanced button and select the automatic turn in the bottom of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available , it can be used to automatically create sub @-@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the section Tool@@ bar Met@@ a data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is normally switched off , and in this case digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you must disable this option . use the Exten@@ ded button and select the Date @-@ based bas@@ al option at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the download button . then select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done &amp; digi@@ kam , you where the images are to be uploaded . a folder cho@@ oser appears for the camera . select the folder you want and press OK to start up@@ loading . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means a position indicated in long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tude and which can be displayed on a map . the determination of the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an aircraft to carto@@ graphic an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environment planners , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability .
if you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser with a click that displays the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ cam ; users who want to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that le@@ x@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ings and map references . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via a re@@ working of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic attri@@ bution ( manual ) and last via the manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS receivers . either as a map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done using g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you must store these data in the g@@ p@@ x format , since this is the only format supported by the geographic classification module .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and the GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tude or other data then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool of Phil Harv@@ ey . it uses the acci@@ dent@@ als of ha@@ iry coordinates created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; try to give you as much control over its work processes as possible . there are many settings that change the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam . to access these settings , you need to choose the Edit menu ; you can switch between these by clicking on the icons on the left .
select Action can be displayed on the previ@@ ewed preview or start image editing . in doing so , you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; specify when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written in the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface .
author &apos;s title is a syn@@ onym for publisher : this field should contain the professional desig@@ nat@@ or of the photographer . this may be desig@@ nations such as photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author field , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the name that the photo offers . this must not be the author if this is for a news agency , such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be registered here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the appropriate IP@@ TC @-@ field . by this it is achieved that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . these metadata are also available to other programs and can be imported in &amp; digi@@ kam , without having to go missing .
save image let@@ tering as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the images . attention : with pictures that already contain labels , these are over@@ written by the Edit .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse cursor is in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information will be displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam ; to view , you can add the file extensions of this list and remove . each file in a &amp; digi@@ kam .
you can reset the default settings again by pressing the Update button to the right of each category .
each time you open the light table , these settings are turned on . however , some images have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole image size lad@@ en@@ quot ; you should only use on fast machines . if you have one , then you can get better picture results .
by default , image editing uses a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can disable the toolbar if you use image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the image . these colors are set here . in image processing , this View Mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling it is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for more explanation .
with the P@@ NG @-@ compression setting , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality since P@@ NG uses loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
the TI@@ FF @-@ files option can be used to comp@@ ress the default compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . it has no effect on the image quality since the defect algorithm works loss @-@ free .
with the setting of loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files , you can save losses @-@ free . even if you select the loss @-@ based setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG . when this paragraph is written , metadata has not yet been supported , but was in the planning .
in the earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image editing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently it is rapidly developing into a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing .
the standard assumption is that all green pixels are the same . if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels in odd rows , this creates a lat@@ tice pattern in the output . this option draws the image a little bit soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used when white balance is not set . standard is to use a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the default is the top lights , so the parts of your images are burned because of the inability of your camera to catch the pointed lights , as continuous white . the setting colors trigger creates some unusual results as it shows the pointed lights in various roses . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights .
this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want .
if you select the Rec@@ on@@ struc@@ ting option , you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than the default 1 . however , this can be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing . in order to keep the time for the demo icing , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a demo icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the partial raw data that come from the color filtered image sensor that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
when digi@@ cam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provides you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks as if A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ es @-@ Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm that was used by D@@ cra@@ w . however , it creates color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges .
if you are familiar with the color deviation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue corrections here . this is certainly the best method for a color gra@@ ding correction , since it is carried out during the shell conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the colour information and gives instructions how to be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information about transl@@ ating color information from a color space to the other means that the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions when an image is opened in image processing / color management module start with raw files .
color Profile Fol@@ der Set here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can save all your profiles .
settings of the ICC profile You have the option &amp; quot ; standard source ; to deposit for your profiles . everything can be changed when opening the raw file .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here just your pictures color does not manage the entire screen .
the input profiles should fit the camera manufacturer and model that you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain any color @-@ mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma is not correc@@ ting for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth .
there are other options like the Soft Pro@@ of profile with which you can em@@ ulate how your image would be returned from a device . this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated .
for most cameras , it is quite obvious what color profile is intended for . unfortunately , not with the models from Canon . therefore here follows a table of cameras and profiles which fit together . this answer is , of course , in@@ official :
the Canon profile extension lets you realize the style for the finish : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing . by delivering this interface , &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules support that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use , and these will then be loaded by &amp; digi@@ kam . these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will also find some in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands .
you can get further information ( in English ) about the K@@ IP@@ I modules under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
slide show settings should be easy to understand . the upper regulator adjust@@ s the time between the picture transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the display .
the camera features on the left hand side show a list of all the currently supported cameras . on the right side there is a button automatic detection , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the picture display mode .
at the bottom end , you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active when you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you need to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / echo , on which you mount your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to display mode and turn on .
check if &amp; digi@@ kam ; the camera automatically recognis@@ es . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the Camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . this will be displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the option of acknowled@@ gement dialog for moving &gt; images in the tr@@ ash bin , you can set the inter@@ viewer from &amp; digi@@ kam ; when you delete a photo in an album . in the sections delete a photo and delete an album you will find more details .
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be used sil@@ ently by &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply if you use the option to apply changes to the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise , you need to apply the changes with the button changes .
you can also display the welcome screen from &amp; digi@@ kam at startup . this may speed up the start of &amp; digi@@ kam . .
the setting Bei@@ m start looking for new photos obli@@ ges &amp; digi@@ kam ; the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos to look for . this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . if something from the base folder was deleted , &amp; digi@@ kam ; you , if it should delete them from the database .
different color schemes can be in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; used to customize the main window to suit your taste . you can select these settings under Settings design from the toolbar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs are defined in plain text files . if you are interested in a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; includes fast image editing with some basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and to correct and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the item Display / Edit .
image editing includes a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam . so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see the Image Processing section .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fication factor , and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top and the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of image editing will change your photos . none of the functions will change the original photo before using the Save or Save button from the toolbar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image .
so you might want to make a copy of your image before you change it . you can do this by file Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the restore from the File Rest@@ ore menu or using the Re@@ producing image editing button in the toolbar . you will then lose any change you have done in the photo since the last storage .
almost every action of image editing can be und@@ one or restored . the last action you can und@@ o by editing Edit back or restored by selecting Edit Rest@@ ore from the menu .
if you use this frequently , you should make use of the keyboard short@@ cuts , C@@ trl + -@@ Z for und@@ o and remember C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press the und@@ o or restore button in the toolbar for a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be und@@ one .
once you have started the image editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , image high , image down or the entries in the File menu . if you made changes in the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save it .
you can enter the photo in and out in which you use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : choose the magni@@ fication factor automatically
view Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view where you can use the Es@@ c key . if you do not want this , you can change this in the Edit Settings dialog ; you can view it from the Edit menu . see the Edit section for editing image editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can choose to print in the File Image menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings here before printing your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual pictures or whole sets . entire image sizes can be printed out of your selection . you only need to select the images using the standard methods and select from the menu Album Ex@@ por@@ tieren print wizard . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , providing important information and actions for the selected images . the same side bar is available without the navigation file , also in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicking on the same tab allows the side@@ bar to appear or disappear again .
the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the labels are copied to the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are resh@@ aped . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label field in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
once you have commented , use either the user button or simply switch to the next image , the labels will then be saved .
in addition to the user button , there is a button More . with this , you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . however , this is always done when you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images .
the review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select them and use the context menu .
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC field Ur@@ gency . the code follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword list shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used previously .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can quickly restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom is a further relief when entering keywords in a series of pictures . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , they are saved for quick access .
keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword in the IP@@ TC field .
if multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this is only applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please read the Key@@ word filter section .
the keyword filter page bar is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar is used with their album , date , keyword and search views . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also drag and drop keywords . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection .
in the upper example , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter is based on no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected using C@@ trl + a , and then a keyword from the right keyword tree was dra@@ gged to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks whether this keyword is to be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be disabled in Settings .
if you have a rule with and created it and find that it needs to be one or its , you can easily change this by double clicking on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry in which the database is searched . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can set an advanced search across all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group@@ ing . the options then look like this :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution there .
this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam , s concrete implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner come from a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanner and that the colors that you print or publish in the web to those from your digital dark@@ room .
when the topic comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed choices at every point of the image processing work@@ flows . additionally , links with deeper information will allow you to make your own informed choices so that you get the desired result .
if your image workflow satis@@ fies all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t need to worry about color management .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB color space . ( see below for more information )
your only other image editions are by email or the web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should one use a different color space and thus have to worry about color management ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors that we really can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e region , and the colors in s@@ RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then on information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to cal@@ li@@ fy my monitor if I decided to work only in s@@ RGB color space ?
yes ! whether you work in s@@ RGB color space or not , you have to cal@@ li@@ fy your monitor , since s@@ RGB assumes that your ; on@@ itor is cal@@ li@@ fied on s@@ RGB . if you work as in the color space of s@@ RGB , then you must either use your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic corrections , which can improve an image in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual processing .
the norm@@ alize , smoo@@ thing , automatic comparison and contrast extend from the menu Cor@@ rection Automatic correction attempt automatic from your colors to make the best . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the density values over the entire image , so that the dark@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without changing its color sh@@ ading . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or balanced .
balance : this method adjust@@ s the intensity factor of the color of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . sometimes the same number of pixels produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation that either causes wonders in an image or destro@@ ys it .
automatic comparison : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it detects the dark and bright shades and adjust@@ s the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram area .
bro@@ aden your contrast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ osity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values in the wi@@ dest possible range and a new image of all values in between . this is only visible with selected images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the White Balance from &amp; digi@@ cam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photograph .
the white balance correction is a bit limited because of a color space with 8 @-@ bit per color . so if you can be too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure may occur . if you can perform the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side , both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen . the preview will be dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original shot again , click on the under@@ window .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is indicated as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
the hist@@ ogram shows a hist@@ ogram that is dynamically changed once you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your total is displayed .
the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shade adjustment lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or even dim them down .
to play an@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . in this way , the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of default settings . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will get the combined result displayed in the white balance . this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save As and Load kno@@ bs make exactly this . any settings of the white balance you have set can be saved to a text file and re@@ charged later .
the Pre@@ ferences button will reset all filter values to their default values and the associated neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original . if you save them , your original image will be changed .
you can set the coding depth per color channel of the edited image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high quality images . this coding requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles .
another important tool can be found in the menu under color value correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time and allows you to use it for several photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same error and therefore always need the same correction .
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under color gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; tool color effects provides you four color effects , a solar installation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also known as Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that was created by expos@@ ing a partially developed pressure to a short flash light and then completing the development of the image . this had the effect that the bri@@ ghter areas darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely .
the intensity controls the Solar@@ isation . at approx . 50 % intensity the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another increase finally creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper .
this is an example of the solar is@@ ation@@ . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and that processed the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simple , it beauti@@ fies many photos .
the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts . the characteristics make it a film of choice for natural photographers . Vel@@ via &apos;s strongly saturated colours are too much for a few photographers , especially those with hardly any scen@@ eries .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repe@@ ats the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not un@@ common that you want to correct the color contrast and lumin@@ osity of the photos . you can experiment to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors .
if you make a photo in poor light conditions , you can get the reverse problem : one too large satur@@ ation . even in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . all changes you can carry out can be seen in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is located in order to improve exposure . even if the dialogue with this tool works very complicated , you need only the area of the slide for the purpose described here . more concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph , three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn is to shift the control and watch how the image changes .
on the right side , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview will be dynamically updated based on the settings of the image . on the left hand side , the following options are available .
scale : with this selection box it is possible to set whether the hist@@ ogram is represented with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera the linear representation is often the most useful . in this case , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic distribution is more useful .
three regul@@ ators : the upper@@ most part for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma values .
the three color brush shapes can be used to preview the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows , middle and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as with the input values . for example , the compression of the output values can be used to create a f@@ lar@@ ed image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground .
automatic : this button sets the image values automatically depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons the pres@@ et values can be stored in the file system and loaded later . to do this , the Gim@@ p Levels format is used .
if you use this mode and three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input is automatically read@@ just@@ ed for all shadows , means and shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels .
the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you only get the effect displayed in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you see an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
the left side shows half of the original and the target image . the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right side , the following options are available :
modi@@ fier channel : this drop @-@ down box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
beside this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures taken with a digital camera is usually the linear mode of the most useful . for pictures with large areas of a constant color , the linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case , log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps .
for example , if you shift a Cur@@ v@@ ace to the right , e.g. the bright notes , you can see that these bright tones correspond to darker parts and that the corresponding pixel pixels are darker .
a red marker is visible on the preview of the original . if you move this marker to the area you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . any curve you created can be stored in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p format .
when you create this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if pixels are found in more than one channel , the combined result is displayed . this is an indicator , i.e. you only get the effect displayed in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo , which was corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and Sun tones were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ cam channel mixer ; image editing is a tool for improving color channels or changing the color shades of the photo .
the channel mixer is another sophisticated tool for mixing the h@@ ues of the images . you can edit it from the menu color channel mixer of image processing .
the channel selection box lets you select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by considering the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left area of the window shows you a preview .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
controls for the module are right below : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you want to keep lumin@@ ance , the image will retain the general brightness as well , as the channel mixer is then THE tool for creating great black @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially if you mix Mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible ru@@ ff that comes from the far@@ brau@@ schen . color @-@ bre@@ wing consists of small room art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear at the same place in the color channel and their noise pattern in each channel looks different . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by allowing you to reduce the color space first .
the Save As and Load Buttons are used for precisely this purpose . you can save any mixer setting for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you only get the effect displayed in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been read@@ just@@ ed . preserve the L@@ umin@@ ance option is enabled . the original image can be seen in ( 1 ) and the edited image at ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of her ability to deal with abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step since color images can be easily converted to the computer .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene images and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves the landscape , maritime scenes and aerial photos . similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate mo@@ on@@ light scenes at the time of day . thus , similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ th@@ aton : produces warm light and middle tones while adding a little cold in the sh@@ att@@ les . this is very similar to the process of ble@@ aching a pressure and the re@@ development in a S@@ epi@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) s@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; apply tools texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a screen , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : move this parameter to the right raises the impression of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper box effect has been applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the modified one ( 2 ) to see . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around an image .
keeping the eye of a be@@ holder in the limits of a photograph is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to put the image into a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your picture . throughout , the image transm@@ its with a coloured line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surround it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , bar@@ red it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a clo@@ ver effect and decorative element add a decorative frame with patterns .
width : specifies the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the pattern decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for the print of the images , especially when you have used the tool after aspect ratio before .
with this handy tool , you can insert easily a format@@ ted text into an image at any place . this also goes to several places when you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply insert the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it .
any setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the &quot; OK &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; apply tool sten@@ cil you can place a template over a picture .
the menu image Tem@@ plate apply in image editing can be used to place templates on a picture .
for the template there are no limitations concerning size and orientation . however , you need to take the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to minimize the file size of the template . if you want to add your template of the &amp; digi@@ cam ; template database , just send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ cam ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view appears , which reflects the folder structure of the template folder . the selection of a folder automatically updates the thumb@@ nail of the templates .
under the preview you will find three buttons to change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this knob enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
smaller : this button reduces the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . to do so , take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your picture . the image will then be adjusted automatically to the thumb@@ nail size .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but creates gra@@ iny images , especially in dark areas .
blur@@ ring mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ per . in fact , it sharp@@ ens not a bit , it works rather psych@@ ically . you can use it to remove atmospheric vap@@ or and it makes a really good job . the algorithm has been taken out of Gim@@ p and it is copyright protected by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focus is possibly the best of the three because it really improves sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjusting .
photos without focus as well as most digi@@ ti@@ zed images require a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the digi@@ tization process has to merge color with only minimal differences to one color point . this in turn results in blur@@ red edges a little blur@@ red . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras usually need more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
in JPEG pictures , a camera has often been used for internal sharpen@@ ing . images in raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some scann@@ ers turn a focus filter already during reading the image . if you disable it , you get control of your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the focus ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ke . you can call this with the menu entry for correc@@ ting sharpen@@ ing .
you should be careful , however , since the results do not appear very natural : sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also enhances the h@@ iss . generally , the most suitable technique for sharpen@@ ing an image re@@ focus the tool . you can achieve it via the menu item Cor@@ rection . under re@@ focus you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques to sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ py . the solution to draw the image a little bit soft is much easier than shar@@ pen it . use the tool to sof@@ ten the menu entry to make sof@@ tening and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
the original image and preview help you to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should first be tried out . an increase in the radius or the amount ampli@@ fy the effect . if you make the blur@@ ring mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ates will produce close to sharp edges .
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , you should better shar@@ pen images in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . thus , a minimal difference can be defined for an edge of the filters . in this way areas with a soft change between tones are exemp@@ ted from shar@@ pen and therefore beauty fla@@ ws in faces , heavens and water surfaces avoided .
this is an example of the blur@@ red mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image the ( 2 ) . blur@@ red mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focus a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ righ@@ ted extraction filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than attempting to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ ters . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a blur@@ ring mask . re@@ focus generally achieves better results than blur@@ red mas@@ king . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing colors in image processing .
in practice , the circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical results also from the source pixels that are far from the original source pixel . in most cases the FI@@ R Wiener In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding is affected very strongly from the remote pixels , causing un@@ desired results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should result in 1 good results .
correlation : an increase in the correlation may help to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation may be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase of the noise filter can help you to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the filter can take values from 0 @-@ 1 . however , values above 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very poor .
Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the sharp@@ ness of the Gau@@ ß . use this parameter if your sharp@@ ness is &apos; G@@ auss &apos; . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a non@@ zero value , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you choose large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . note however that the module is very slow if you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save As and Load Buttons are used for precisely this purpose . any re@@ focuss@@ ing parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all cutting , color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before otherwise changing the image . the reason for this is that much operations are not immediately visible , but later leave unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts .
if you want to read and comp@@ ress pictures , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
in general , In@@ sharp Mas@@ k@@ ieren produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by the un@@ inten@@ tional mas@@ king uses a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing .
even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blur@@ ring . for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lin@@ e@@ are filter . practically , the result of the FI@@ R Viennese filter is always at least as good as the sharp@@ ness mask . the FI@@ R Viennese filter is often better in processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focuss@@ ed image :
the original un@@ sharp color image must be corrected . this picture was taken with an analog camera . the un@@ focuss@@ ed result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information about the methods of sharp@@ shooting in digital pictures you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the sli@@ der regul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink tin@@ ting allows for a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , you can adjust it here .
the image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools for removing unwanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the painting algorithm has been developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g Project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration process . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings more fine , you can use the tab smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detail maintenance p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to smooth smoo@@ th@@ ness over the picture . whereas larger values are mainly smoo@@ thed over homogeneous regions and details are sharp . a value of 0.@@ 9 should receive details in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary afterwards .
directional dependence Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes out evenly in all directions , while a value close to 1 only smoo@@ ths in one direction . if you have a film grain or a CCD smoke will produce a high value wavel@@ i@@ ke @-@ like patterns . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 .
smoo@@ ten &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all@@ . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore set this value to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if very much noise is present , as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : specifies how often the algorithm is passed through . normally , 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angle step length &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha small is selected , it should also be small . make sure that small angles generate a long term . therefore , you should choose this value as much as possible and for your needs acceptable .
integrated step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integrated step width in pixels . you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never greater than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the more the quality you get by selecting this option is minimal . it doubles the duration but we recommend it to let it out .
the Save As and Load kno@@ bs make exactly this . any setting of image errors can be saved to a text file and then re@@ charged later .
correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Canc@@ el .
the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a peculiar black arti@@ fact in the foreground that caused by a bad film deposit during the trip . the original image is visible under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scanned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise which can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you only need the sub @-@ window details and the sub@@ window Advanced Settings can stay with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter per pixel is needed and can bl@@ ur the image . the area indicated by the radius is smoo@@ thed over the image and the color in it is smoo@@ thed and therefore minor errors corrected .
sharp@@ ness : controls the focus level . this value sets the pixel pitch the filter looks forward to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if it is increased , noise peaks will be deleted . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details cannot be preserved and noise or lubrication occurs again .
edges : controls edge accuracy for sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , it is not possible to remove the entire noise or noise peaks . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak sound or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend either to change colour or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings do not influence the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings do not influence the smoo@@ thing process that is checked by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma vari@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance levels of the darker areas , which are typically stronger .
atten@@ u@@ ation : controls the adjustment of phase d@@ amping . this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of the lumin@@ ance density . if it is increased , the edges appear smoo@@ ther when it is too high , the edges may appear blur@@ red .
store under and load : these buttons are used exactly for it . all the noise reduction parameters you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cris@@ py for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a bit soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use this tool to shar@@ pen the sof@@ ter with the menu item Cor@@ rection soft@@ ness and experiment with the smoo@@ th@@ ness . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove G@@ auss &apos;s noise , film grain , scrat@@ ches , compres@@ sion@@ art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that appear in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images .
the same algorithm can be used for color and texture conversion . the texture statement is performed using a different tool , image error correction . the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , even far away from compression in some areas . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; arti@@ facts quot ; - small standards that can be seen in the un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the Save As and Load kno@@ bs make exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be saved to a text file and then re@@ charged later .
photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish .
the module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera to an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film grain on the faces .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time texture was applied to an old colour photograph created using a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts caused by the scanner lights and the photographic paper . the original image is visible under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows Hot@@ pixel images to be removed with a CCD camera , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project protected by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw mode . many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; &amp; quot ; B@@ right Pix@@ el@@ quot ; to remove on a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wizard with the dark image button . the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important to directly record the dark image after a new hot or bright pixel by CCD defective .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the appropriate dark@@ ening image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wizard will remember the last dark image and will automatically load it in the next session .
the image area and the preview help you to correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with current settings .
select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
average : an average of the adjacent pixel is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear interface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of quad@@ r@@ atic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is visible under ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image .
wide angle lenses , especially those in the medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area evenly . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting &amp; quot ; ( shade ) it the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior .
many center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter , which increases the necessary shutter speed under certain circumstances so that it is impossible to use the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be using a center filter , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise non @-@ sharp@@ ness effects are caused by motion .
with the wide exposure ranges of today &apos;s film and color or gray scale depth of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ Filter by using an equivalent transformation on a raw image without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correc@@ ting applies the transformation using a C@@ enter@@ Filter on a picture . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three controls you can control the vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three further expos@@ ures of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity d@@ amping at the point of the greatest density of the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which corresponds to an optical filter with a lens aperture of 1 , or random@@ ly a light intensity of 2 , reducing it to compensate for a small degree .
brightness , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the brightness of pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide you with positive values , since you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fin@@ er read@@ just@@ ment of the exposure of the target image , you leave the values for lumin@@ ance / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the vig@@ net@@ ting correction to an image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . color distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree covers the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s on the edges . this correction is not applied in the mold .
the coefficient of the fourth degree correc@@ ts the distant corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ rical distortion can be almost eliminated .
general : this value controls the thickness of distortion second degree . with negative values , barrel distortion units can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion of the fourth degree . this value has a stronger effect on the edges than in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner Par@@ ameters &apos; has the opposite sign of the general parameter .
zoom : this value res@@ izes the image size and makes correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive the image res@@ izes .
brigh@@ ten : this value adjust@@ s the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog box shows the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start .
the correction or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all changes of the size or size . the best way to do this is to perform this correction as the first one . if you re @-@ cut an image and then perform a sound @-@ like correction , the effect would be evi@@ dently the wrong one .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal guide line . move the mouse cursor in the image preview to display the dotted lines . move it to an important place , such as the edge of the sea or a building wall , in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . subsequently , you can correct the sound / cushion distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them using the trimm@@ ing tool in the menu Transform@@ ers from image processing or via the Zoom regulator of this dialog .
the next logical step for some motifs such as photos from the front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective .
this is an example of a ton@@ ne correction on a church in Norway . the original image can be seen in ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating inf@@ ra @-@ red film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org web page that is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ ra video , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity area of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can set two parameters of fil@@ en@@ izing and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the option to simulate the fine @-@ gra@@ ined texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator changes the amount of film grain and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows become white like snow !
since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel , it does not make sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the colour information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top lights .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; filter film grain is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film grain on your images . this is known by classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , manufacturers mix large silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back to the past . the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere from everyday life . if you want this special gallery @-@ like , road @-@ photographic , gra@@ iny sight specially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you have to use this filter .
with the controller , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , set to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white image . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the edited the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting . natural pictures and still life are good for this effect .
there are two regul@@ ators to influence this effect . the upper hand sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brush is better suited for large images . smoo@@ thing controls the smoo@@ th@@ ness or , looked from the other side , the sharp@@ ness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is marked with the ( 1 ) and the processor is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel big picture is 1 and smooth 17 .
the digi@@ cam ; Filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a coal cap . images whose gra@@ dients vary slowly are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen yourself to sket@@ ch you .
there are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper controller sel@@ ects the pen size and the lower adjust@@ s the contrast ( smoo@@ th@@ ness ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; filter engraving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; filter engraving is a fast tool to re@@ play your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , in which color is not the most important in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a gray , mon@@ och@@ rom@@ atic landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distor@@ ting effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and make it look as if it is considered by blocks of glass .
wave blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wavel@@ eng@@ ths 1 , the image is distorted by another version of glass blocks .
some effects need a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the Stop button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of blur@@ ring effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines starting from a focal point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al bl@@ ur : blur@@ red the image by turning the pixels into a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image through horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : shoot from a car or train , camera .
sof@@ tening bl@@ ur : bl@@ urs the image smoothly into the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
shar@@ per sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image by accidental shifting of pixels and simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur : find the colour font in the picture and blur@@ red it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divide the photo into rectangular cells and then create it through the filling with an average pixel value .
some effects need a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time using the Stop button .
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops on your picture . this gives natural to your images a wet appearance . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
drop size allows to change the size of drops . because the drop size does not automatically increase with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes changes the optical effect of drops on the image .
you can use the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing to keep an area free of rain@@ drops . to do this use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ ff , the area will remain free of rain@@ drops .
this is an example of the rain@@ drop filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the edited image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can turn it into the right direction through mirrors or turning . you will find the tools in the menu Transform@@ ers rotate or transform mirrors .
photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom in a picture if the boundaries of the resolution are reached ? how can you re @-@ inv@@ ent or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm that is used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select the Transform@@ ers size in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is to be seen below .
the tool for res@@ izing uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to increase a small image with better quality , then try the tool to infl@@ ate .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ cam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the New size tab and are listed below :
maintain aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if very much noise is present , as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
the Save As and Load kno@@ bs are used exactly for it . enlar@@ ging each photo for photo can be saved as a text file and then re@@ charged later .
photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it can take a very long time and a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish .
you can see below an example for photo bubbles by magni@@ fying a small color image on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magni@@ fication for comparison .
editing a photograph is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool for putting together a picture . to crop a photo , simply use the mouse to create a rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle . you will see this rect@@ angle then while you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again , the area of the photo is cut out . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by dra@@ gging on the corners of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle will create by simply dra@@ gging it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The trimm@@ ing button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl + + X ) . use the file Save or File Save as in the File menu to save the newly cut photo .
in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains intact .
depending on the aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format . in the portrait format , the larger value of the height and the trans@@ verse format of the width is always assigned .
the tool Ac@@ cor@@ ding to aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches , inches or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and its aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog exist two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically .
below in the dialog you can use the Max . ratio button to cut the range to the greatest possible , depending on the selected ratio and orientation .
the tool Fol@@ lowing aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horizon@@ tal or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the trimm@@ ing tool the next time , these settings will be displayed as default values depending on the orientation . the modified image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image .
the settings of the merge help allow you to hide aids so that you can better assemble your pictures . these help are :
harmonic triangle : harmonic parti@@ als are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third rule , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to share a rect@@ angle in a similarly harmonious triangle centered on the diag@@ onal .
golden middle : the golden middle is a division that refers to various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the flower pet@@ als of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel beautiful .
the golden pitch is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number deri@@ ves from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where each number is equal to the sum of their two previous numbers .
the golden center provides more fluid support lines when you put a picture together . these help are listed below :
the golden spiral will bring you closer to your goal of achieving good results for your photos . compared to the third rule , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the gaze of the be@@ holder along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow in this way .
a further rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . this rect@@ angle is used to create the golden spiral . it should give something that the eye drops into the center of the composition . this can be a line or diver@@ gent objects .
the Golden Tri@@ angles are also derived from the above @-@ mentioned golden spiral . its verti@@ ces are the middle points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no matching tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to these lines can be placed a static object more dynamic .
when you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , you create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise .
the options Horizon@@ tal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic partitions .
with the color button you can set the color of the relief lines . if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast , the help lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
when you make a photo , it happens easily that you do not hold the camera vertically or horizontally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can do this with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing and the tool free rotation .
rotate your picture with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this slide are specified in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button you can set the sli@@ der to 0 degrees again . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are displayed on the top right .
for your help , the free rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines . after moving it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you have turned a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the function Transform@@ ers cutting from the image processing .
an elegant way to crop the image is the Auto Cir@@ cul@@ ation function . select one of the following options :
option Anti @-@ ali@@ asing smoo@@ thes the image a bit after rotation . note however the above warning .
all perspective transform@@ ations are performed by a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically calculated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle at the top left shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle at the bottom : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image is slightly gre@@ ased . for a single adjustment , this effect is small , but two adjustments generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adjusted the perspective , you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transformer cutting out of the image processing .
the locking tool is used to move a part of the image into one direction and move the other part to the opposite . for example , a horizontal she@@ ar will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram .
rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be shown and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown to the right of the preview pane .
to your help , a vertical and a horizontal line is displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the locking tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image is wi@@ ped a bit . for a single sh@@ ear@@ ing , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two loops generate twice as much bl@@ ur and therefore you should avoid this .
after sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image has blur@@ red tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transformer cutting out of the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries are compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam .
due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to list all file formats that are available on their system . however , they will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF below .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; displays only files in formats that you know . this is done by means of the file extension and a comparison of those with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , &amp; digi@@ kam . you can change this list of file extensions the &amp; digi@@ kam . in the Con@@ figuration section you will find more information on this .
nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia .
image compression is the application of data compression processes to digital images . this reduces redundant information in order to store image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG with the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss@@ less when specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read very helpful instructions in English under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour . you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TI@@ FF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam .
digi@@ cam ; support the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is available in &amp; digi@@ pack ; it supports more than 200 raw file formats . all supported cameras can be viewed at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that are supported by &amp; digi@@ kam ;
many digital cameras support recording short films . these clips are often stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ cam ; but is not a film editing program and therefore does not have any built @-@ in ways to view or edit movies . if you click on a film file &amp; digi@@ kam , the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playback of movies use to start the program to play .

many tools you need to edit the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ cam ; contain . your description follows here .
all image processing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , sof@@ ter , noise reduction , re@@ focus , mas@@ king , &amp; so ; . use a uniform dialog box that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; Tex@@ tile App@@ lic@@ quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter on the current image . left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertical parts without dup@@ licate . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview range .
horizontally divide without dup@@ licate . the upper area shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview range .
the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper section shows the original and the lower part shows the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ M@@ ouse over &apos; style : displays the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch on to display over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and place it on the part of the image you want to preview . previ@@ ewing in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings of the last use of the module are noted .
the side@@ bar displays the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data come from EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can zoom in or zoom in with the mouse wheel or hold it and move it . move it while clicking the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this assumes , of course , that your pictures contain ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used for editing color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the Pal@@ ettes files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can be applied either to the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors .
in the palette , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders for files .
the cursor is shown as a line in the pallet view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the color beside it . the color is described under the pallet view . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used to select . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor to it . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box Bei@@ m C@@ ursor is activated under the Button Colour , the color is inserted from the color panel at the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the Over@@ write mode is selected . this mode can be set by selecting the Over@@ write box under the cursor .
a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used together with the copying , trimm@@ ing and inser@@ ting actions .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line @-@ ending character , if another color follows . if therefore three num@@ eric values are in the clip@@ board , they can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ;
the colors in the palette and the color selection output can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color selection on the left .
Graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs that &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are out@@ dated &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ ima@@ p ; -@@ Project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ ima@@ p ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; Graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ Gra@@ ph ; graphical programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ ima@@ p ; displays graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user friendly &amp; GUI ; an . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Po@@ sters ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in the graph in and out ; the graph re@@ comp@@ uted and displayed in &amp; k@@ graphs ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; kate ; open or graph in &amp; k@@ graphs ; in a &amp; kate ; -@@ Compon@@ ent to open
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems with about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to represent more than these no@@ des )
other required software : &amp; k@@ screen viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for representation of graphs pres@@ upp@@ os@@ ed . in detail :
the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub @-@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ screen viewer ; without starting an argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen@@ shot . in this case , the toolbar contains only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list of recently opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog file .
after selecting one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the screen@@ shot below :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special buttons , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; button ) ;
the zo@@ oming in both directions is limited by the factor of 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the file that is currently loaded in &amp; k@@ ima@@ p ; loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will appear :
you can choose whether the graph is to be rel@@ o@@ aded or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ Photo@@ viewer ; you can also remember your decision , so that later as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can use the menu item Pre@@ ferences k@@ screen viewer ; set up ... , see also .
if you open a graph file outside a running &amp; k@@ ima@@ p ; instance , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ ima@@ p ; instance or to display the graph to be loaded in a sub @-@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but you can change it afterwards with the setup dialog .
at the start of the program you can re@@ open all graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice both later and later .
you can also specify how to split the graph to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph , which come to a page , should be fitted to this page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with a graph@@ ene distributed across multiple pages without header and with a different font
the Er@@ ne@@ ut loading page gives the ability to specify behavior when a file has been modified on the hard disk , and eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( rel@@ o@@ ad automatically or ignore the changes ) or let the program consult each time .
the opening page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ ima@@ p ; to specify when a graph is opened outside of a current session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub @-@ window of the already running session ) or specify that every time is requested .
the session administration page gives the possibility to specify the start behavior of &amp; k@@ ima@@ p ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session ) or decide to be asked at every start .
the context menu , which normally appears at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s ; opens up more possibilities :
here you can select from various &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z website , are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directed graph . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered representations of aligned graphs . the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overl@@ aps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ coated graph@@ ene . it produces representations in accordance with the spring model . the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is equivalent to statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP algorithm creates a spring model layout for un@@ finished graph@@ ene . it uses the Fru@@ chter@@ man Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ gate trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the no@@ des in a circle according to the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .

the K@@ IP@@ I module read images provides tools to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports by the San@@ e project or another source such as video streams . to make this work you need to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you scan the menu entry images , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to fetch the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears to be able to replace the default of duc@@ it &apos;s own to select your image accordingly . view the preview and customize the range of your needs before you scan the image with the button . the estimated file size will be shown in the right , lower corner .
make sure that the window is completely displayed , as some settings may not be displayed .
after pressing the button Scan , you need to wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the options of the target image appears . please remember that type BM@@ P does not comp@@ ress and therefore produces very large files . you also need to select or create the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image to be saved .
you can create screen@@ shots after you have selected in the menu Im@@ por@@ tation &gt; Screen Photo ... a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all of your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ station . if you have selected the complete desktop , only the window below the mouse is read .
the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other working areas , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there .
after the screen@@ shot is made , the dialog box appears with the options described above .

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management on the Internet . Fli@@ ck@@ r makes it possible to send photos to people who are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world , put photos of your camera mobile online and show your photos secure and private to your friends and family all over the world .
the ex@@ porting module to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
if you use the module for the first time , you will be guided through the process of creating a token . this will be used for your authentication . so it is virtually your ID to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so that you can log in to Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after the successful registration , the module can send photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r webs@@ it@@ e.@@ You will be presented the following page after a successful registration .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after pressing Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
if the ex@@ porting module is started to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which displays the current access per@@ missions that the module displays . at the moment , you don &apos;t need any other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions .
the button photos should be pressed once after you have set all the other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . pressing the O@@ k button starts the upload of the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r server .
the keywords field can be filled with a comm@@ a @-@ separated list of words . these are added to the image as keywords during the upload process .
with the options Public , Friends , and Fam@@ il@@ ly , you can adjust the per@@ missions to your images . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you change the option Modi@@ fy the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos will be changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value entered at maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed in such a way that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export has no documentation at this time . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and the location can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools for loc@@ ating images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tude are used .
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in the g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical Loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and invo@@ ke the menu . the above @-@ to @-@ see dialog appears . to perform a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . this file naturally contains data that were taken at the same locations as the images of your camera .
when the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed which indicates the coordinates in red . GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera period must be converted with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera time here .
the setting for maximum time vari@@ ance gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera period . if the deviation is included , the data will be merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data of a place for pictures you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all the images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ating and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have the right data . if you know that in reality a location is in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos at the same location . since the dialog opens the coordinates of one call to the next , you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . select the region concerned and enlarge si@@ e.@@ Run this time and again until you have reached sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the card can be changed between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ ft@@ tool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery is a tool for ex@@ porting a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a photo gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that should be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded U@@ TF @-@ 8 in order to enable the best internation@@ alization .
the tab has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab Select allows to select all albums that should be exported to HTML . the albums are not displayed hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right side , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the Al@@ ben@@ vor@@ schau and the text that appear in the header of the HTML page will appear .
the rider appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . the option To create a page for each image creates a gallery in which each image also gets its own page . if you then click on a picture , a new page is displayed in which the image is displayed . otherwise the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show
the tab album defines the settings where and how to save the gallery with all your associated images . to do so , select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ export , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images .
with Other color depth , you can change the default color depth . of course , this also affects the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tab &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thumb@@ nails &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; allows you to adjust some of the settings from the Album tab for thumb@@ nails , which are small images to be displayed in the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a progress window displays the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to see if errors occurred during creation . the web browser will automatically be started at the end to preview the gallery .
the K@@ IP@@ I viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations like turning , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons . it has been developed for quick picture display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture will appear in full screen mode by default . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less module is a tool for changing pictures without compromising your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions listed below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of loss@@ less storage is that the file size increases since there is no compression of the color information . this can be found e.g. with the P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera clip is a tool for connecting your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Digital@@ Camera @-@ Kli@@ ent currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . to do so , select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write in any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please refer to exi@@ v2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver module can be used to convert selected images into an MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages . you can also add a base image transition between the individual images . you can also add an audio file to the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can select a background color for slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . finally , you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program to burn the medium .
you first need to select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG Sli@@ deshow . then you can create the module via Tools MPEG Sli@@ deshow .
the images you have selected are then listed in the Portfolio catalog files . there you can also change the sorting of the images or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV Standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that an image is displayed . the speed of the image transition is defined below . a low value creates very sudden , but very smooth image changes .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave it black . you can set the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG output file . keep as fast as possible .
if you specify an audio file in the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . once you have adjusted all settings to your wishes , you can start the creation of the movie using the Code button . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now go for a coffee and enjoy the slide show if you are back again .
if a critic appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can customize the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages via the Settings right bottom .
the printer wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper along with standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the Image Processing Gim@@ p . this is e.g. useful to improve or print the Gim@@ p module directly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w of Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from him is : do not expect d@@ cra@@ w to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first select the RAW file to be converted and run the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window appears in the mode for a single image . with the Pre@@ view button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness , and red / blue amps can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal you can edit the image later .
a four @-@ color R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect .
once you &apos;re happy with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same and only the extension is adapted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss @-@ based algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it .
the tagged image format , TI@@ FF , retains all the information of your image and uses loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you intend to edit your images frequently , or later otherwise use them further , you should not choose the JPEG format , since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ates . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Run button . if you want to break this process again , you can use Canc@@ el .
batch processing mode allows you to convert several images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , they have the possibility to over@@ ride existing files automatically . this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar indicates how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can make the image smaller or enlarge .
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . for example , you can use this option to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : dispro@@ portion@@ ate size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
print preparation : prepares the image for the photo print . the user can set the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , will be adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
after you started the module , the image window will be displayed with the images you have selected . you can add more images via the button images . for the last selected image , a preview will be displayed on the right .
you can also drag images to the picture list and place them there to add them to the list of images to be sent .
the button images remove the selected images from the list of the images to be sent .
after you have selected all the images you can open the New Message window of your email client with the OK button . you only need to add the addresses and the subject here . the pictures you have selected are attached as attachments .
don &apos;t mind sending too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions on the size of sending emails . it might be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it .
select your email client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments to the images are added to a text file and added to the mail .
the P@@ NG format under the View menu file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . therefore , you should use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed .
when you select JPEG files in JPEG format and the original files are in JPEG format , the original Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Data will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so that you can view the status messages on the search for errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . with the button C@@ lose , you can close this window .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au a window with questions like you want to have displayed your slide show appears . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL @-@ transitions option in the presentation activ@@ ates very elegant image transitions by Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Show file name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; option ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images is displayed in the lower left corner of the presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the loop allows the presentation to be displayed in an endless loop . you can then manually cancel it with Es@@ c .
the option images random@@ ly select makes the images appear in a random order . so it is not used the order of the pictures in the album .
the time interval between the images can be set between the images . 1500 mil@@ lis@@ ec@@ onds are 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . so you should test it before you show your friends !
there are over a dozen transition effects between which you can select . by chance , each transition between the images sel@@ ects a different effect .
during the slide show you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse in this corner to turn on .
with this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next image and stop the slide show .
on the left lower screen edge you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Time &amp; Date now has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool for setting an image as a background image for the desktop .
this module displays the currently selected image , depending on the selected sub@@ menu option , as background for your K@@ DE work@@ surface .
once you have ann@@ ot@@ ated your pictures and videos with comments , you can with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; by these brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see by a comparison with the image , are now available in each group , i.e. in people , places and in group keywords entries .
in the browser window , you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have ann@@ ot@@ ated your pictures and videos . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current preview images .
when you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
if you select another person only the pictures on which both people are shown . through this selection method you can restrict the number of displayed images from a few thousand images to a few single images .
if you have selected all persons , locations and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your sphere of activity .
in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can record with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person to store a separate preview picture , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself . see also the picture .
to view images next to the name , select the button located on the right @-@ side of the toolbar . in the pop @-@ up context menu , you can select which view you want to use for each category separately . this has the advantage that you can display symbols with pictures of people and a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have suitable pictures for your keywords ) .
however , you must decide for yourself which image should be displayed for each individual person . to do this , you need to open the Image View@@ point window ( described in more detail ) and in the context menu select the entry categories editor . in the View window , you can customize the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be viewed and / or cut off .
if you visit the search entry in the main window , a dialog is displayed that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog on the image again .
if you enter a string of characters in the cap@@ tion or description field , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the images will be searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can either be a part of the total date , e.g. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use an area of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the bottom of the window , you can search all images by specific names as you can see in the picture . here , pictures on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like reading manuals , but prefer to try out functions like this , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; and watch the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; and select in the first dialog the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; demo . ther@@ eu@@ pon some sample pictures are loaded and you can try the features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ;
if you prefer to print this manual , you can find it on the Homepage of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar see here : . as the name says , this bar displays you data statistics on the pictures in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then displays a different unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying the bar only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date will appear in the preview pane ) and the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images if you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select an area of the tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . if you select an area , you will only see images of this period in the preview view . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you two ways to create HTML websites with your pictures . the one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can create via the File HTML ... menu .
before creating HTML pages you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas : content , Layout and Go@@ al . in the following , each section is described in more detail .
first , enter the title of the review and a description that the HTML file should contain later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages see an example of these settings .
next , select whether a &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; export file should be created which is to be seen on the overview page .
finally , you can choose which information to display on the HTML pages . therefore , you can avoid displaying information that is obvious to the viewer without description . note that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; at the moment all images are exported . therefore , you cannot use this setting to hide specific images from particular viewers .
in this section you can specify how the HTML pages are to look like . most settings are unique , which is why they are not specifically addressed to them .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . this means that those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 cannot download images which , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you specified . so , it can browse your images with low resolution , leading to a smaller transmission time . if you want to get an image larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting range , you specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
the best choice for all your HTML files is a basic folder and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first you need to select the main folder where all your pictures are saved . this folder is saved and added automatically next time . this allows you to select the location for all future images . here you can either select a folder or a log supported by K@@ DE , for example :
once you have created your images , you can check if these are really all visible to viewers . if you choose a URL for the base folder , a web browser will start after the pages have been created . the URL you set here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files you create aren &apos;t yet in the final destination folder , you have to manually copy them there . to enable the import function , see , properly you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings that are just described have all been related to basic folders and URLs . in these settings , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name will be specified in the output folder .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; coming together , you may want to create your pictures with these . however , if you have spent a lot of time applying the image information , persons on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work does not even do this .
with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ in file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if there is only one link to images in the file . the advantage of saving all images in the file is that you can have all the pictures together and pass this file as independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can export a .@@ k@@ in file directly from the File Export ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ in file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ in file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file scans the images in two ways . first , it searches the images found in the .@@ k@@ im file folder . if the corresponding pictures are not found , then the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
the following describes the dialog for ex@@ porting images that you can view from the Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are three choices available :
in the manual copy option to close the .@@ k@@ im file , you have to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automati@@ cally to copy Automati@@ cally close the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most of the images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is not normally worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you want this anyway , simply select the Export File option .
the last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the pictures in full size as the .@@ k@@ in file would otherwise be very large . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the Import menu ... select &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; import the exported database as described in .
the wizard for import consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then to which folders to import the images to be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category of persons of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is called persons in your database . therefore , in the third dialog box you will be asked which categories of the file to import to import , and which categories these are in your database .
in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . for example , see the picture .
it has to be easy to browse and view images : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump inside of different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; for example , if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover an image with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will pass the various steps of ( 1 ) Design@@ ating the information about your images , via ( 2 ) browsing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album has started as a program to manage your images , but it has been expanded and today your videos are also taken care of . in many places in this manual you talk about images , but often this also includes videos .
&amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of your images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where you want them .
&amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; records the folder where your images are stored and will automatically re@@ use it in future releases . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so you can start a different folder tree with pictures , you can start with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu entry settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you get to a window with which you can modify the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the User Manual , you will be able to explain the different settings .
on the left you can see six different symbols that allow you to view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can call to the F1 key and a click on the desired option .
it describes how you can define different properties for each image , for example people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog that is used to edit already existing groups . for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol .
sub@@ categories have already been mentioned in the Options section . in the Options dialog , you can set up complete members , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a Medi@@ fan as explained in .
in the list of preferences you can select the category you want to configure . in the left part of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; spl@@ its its modular system with other graphic applications such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface .
the modules can be called via the menu modules . the modules can and will not be described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; they are , but separately sold . however , most of the modules have a help page that you can call through the modules themselves .
since the modules are used by several applications together , it may be that the modules have been tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; therefore , you should always test new modules first with the demo database before using them on your own pictures . demo database can be either via the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . don &apos;t say I would not have warned you !
the applications that the modules use over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage when you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications can arrange their pictures into albums : this is an album simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this type of order does not support , it simul@@ ates for some modules the order after albums so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ;
it simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all the images that show you the picture preview right now .
apart from the current album &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have a list of albums . here &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you set in preferences as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category people , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do so whether you have selected people to view and pass it on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . to do so , start the settings dialog and select the modules to load modules .
on the picture you will see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used to by any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and toolbar at the top . under the toolbar , you will see the window with which you have entered your image database . in the section we will return to this window , but now click on the pictures to show you an overview of all existing images .
one of the main features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to comment any picture with notes . this includes information about the people who are shown on the picture , where the picture has been taken , etc . you can set each image individually or for a larger number of pictures simultaneously . if for example on all pictures Jes@@ per is depicted and all pictures taken in Copenhagen .
all these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these comments if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in view you can see three lists with a text box by setting persons , locations and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; since you will always use them whenever you enter information about your images .
the following idea is based on postpon@@ ing the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are depicted , you can , by the fact that the names used are moved up to find and assign persons more quickly .
if you prefer to see an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sorting by date under the list .
if you have selected ann@@ ot@@ ations for each image individually , you may want to edit all the selected images and add these images with notes . in this case , simply click on the above and back buttons that are located at the top right below the preview of the image .
if you have recorded several images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and to use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . also , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California .
on the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as a super@@ group . in order to show you that it is a over @-@ group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the Not@@ ation dialog it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category or sub@@ category . additionally , you can simply drag an entry to a category and place it in order to make it a sub @-@ category of this entry .
you can move the single elements of the ann@@ ot@@ ation dialog by clicking and moving the bar that form the upper edge of the box . you can also make a separate window from a frame by moving it outside the window area .
if you have adjusted the look of the window so to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options button , which among other things offers you the possibility to save the current layout and appearance of the window .
you can leave a frame completely hidden . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and then hide / hide windows . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the images in the browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or all images if you have not set a filter . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the thumb@@ nails size by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button . try it again .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as a background image for your desktop .
if you click on a picture , it will be displayed in the image viewer . if you have not opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and press either the removal key or select Del@@ ete from the Edit menu . now the window will show you that you can see in the image .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; namely , images without you saved on the hard drive . of course you need to have the images somewhere saved with that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can view the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive .
pictures in which the upper right corner is cut are not saved on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 the thumb@@ nails are present , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can &apos;t view these images with the picture viewer .
as you see , this feature requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them back again . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; don &apos;t support it up to now to insert the CD concerned . so if you want to avoid trouble on how to avoid the confusion of your images , please buy a larger hard drive to save all images on it .
in the pictures menu , you will find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that at the end those who want to make you in@@ accessible to others and click on current view lock in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also control all the pictures your little sister can see and lock the menu item Any@@ thing except current view .
this allows you to specify which images should be hidden in the case of the case . if you give the laptop to your little sister , just select the menu entry to lock pictures , so that all the images you have locked are hidden . if you want to get the pictures again displayed click on lock .
it is also possible to set a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select your password in the privacy menu .
please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , all pictures on the hard disk and on the other hand can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only used to rep@@ el those who are with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to rep@@ el the view to private pictures .
the reason why you want to spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is of course that you want to consider them some@@ day . for this reason &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; via a picture _ and video viewer .
the viewer can see in . it obviously shows the picture , but additional all the information you have entered through the picture , e.g. who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc .
if you want to see the info box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and place somewhere else . you can also configure what information is displayed and whether information is displayed at all . all of these options are available right click on the viewer . the then pop @-@ up context menu can be seen below .
if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have several images loaded in the viewer , you can switch between them before and after by using the buttons image up and down . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and the end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run it as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus or minus .
a very useful ability of the viewer of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can zoom in and zoom into the image . to zoom in , you can simply drag a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the minus key , you can zoom in again . shows how a zoom rect@@ angle is selected and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . using the magic button sets the zo@@ oms so that each pixel on the screen matches a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work in videos that enter and zoom in with the plus and minus key .
with the rotation functions from the context menu , you can turn the image . this does not work for videos . you can make notes on the current image using the menu item Not@@ ices from the context menu .
if you look at pictures it can happen that you find an image with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can view this and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter these names . you will perhaps prefer to mark only the image and view more images .
another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see which photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while watching one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer has the possibility to display images with features while you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . in view you can see a picture in which the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your pictures , these can be viewed in your browser . so , if you print all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , then you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in preview view . if you view categories in the particular preview view , you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you are allowed &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; to paint on the picture .
the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . in this way you can und@@ o your painted one later .
in , you can see a picture on which it was painted . to turn on the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; on the image , select on the image from the context menu . to end the painting simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to use the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully profi@@ cient , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understand .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wi@@ re@@ format views .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an object that is already selected , since all objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click either the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the In@@ sert menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu is displayed , so that you can select the correct position :
you can either delete selected objects from the scene with del@@ eting from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button context menu .
if you have changed properties , click Apply to assume these changes . if you entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and click on the user or disc@@ ard the changes with Canc@@ el .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ Refer@@ ences to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view .
press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture will be rendered even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , check the box locally .
the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these check@@ points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the check@@ points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a Visi@@ bility level as a wire model . you can indicate this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects will only be displayed when they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the level of visibility chosen in the toolbar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window layout , or if you need a different layout , you can set it at will . you can also save multiple window orders and simply switch between different configurations .
to anchor a window over or under a view , drag the beginning to the upper or lower edge of a view . a rect@@ angle then displays the new position .
to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other , drag the starter in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map tab at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to solve a view from the anch@@ or@@ age , drag the inf@@ ant to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left in the cham@@ fer strip .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the cham@@ fer strip . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any location .
the actual window view can be saved with view window layout ... Save . a dialog appears where you can save the window layout under an existing or new name .
if you created a scene , you can render it render . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to render , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene , click the Ren@@ dering symbol Ren@@ dering in the toolbar or select View Sc@@ ene menu item .
a render mode matches the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and the quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many render modes as you like from a quick preview to full @-@ quality images .
if you click the render settings icon in the toolbar or select R@@ ender modes in the View menu , the following dialog will be opened :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode .
in the map tab size , you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the section sub@@ section and enter the image cut to render into the input fields .
in combination field quality , you can select the properties that are used for rendering . this works from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection light . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User &apos;s Guide to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if an image is rendered with just one ray per pixel , different errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel in the representation . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally , pictures with this feature are better off .
if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , it calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as a standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling involves the neighboring pixels . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is repeatedly divided and adaptive because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a beam per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixel exceeds the default threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a specific additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a lat@@ tice of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) will be charged extra beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference then is :
activities in the United States ( R 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels that are individually followed and tested for further sub@@ divisions . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another possibility to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the production of noise for the ray process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn on J@@ it@@ tering , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection is calculated . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can specify whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the corresponding beams have not hit an object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly finished , you can find the reason for this here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene to import , select the menu entry file Import ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the complete command range of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . if error messages or warnings occur when im@@ porting , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source text between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Begin and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this inserts the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene simply select the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ray ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually , this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on Help in the property view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; User documentation for the displayed object . set the path to your documentation and the version here . supported are 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; looking for external files ( for example height field data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used to display the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type number plates .
you can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects like e.g. the ball you can set the detail level separately for two directions .
if you check high detail fi@@ del@@ ity for extended projections , all wire model views are further sub@@ divided if the camera uses an extended projection . extended projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections . this feature gives a better approach for projections , but requires more time to render .
when you view a wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is displayed in a check@@ er@@ board pattern made of two adjustable colors .
when you cross the floor , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is displayed in a check@@ er@@ board pattern made of two adjustable colors .
if you check box smoo@@ thing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value . more details on the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section .
on this page , you can modify existing window orders or create new window orders . in the window orders section it is explained how to create and store window orders .
the Com@@ bin@@ ation field Standard window arrangement : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program .
the list of window orders present shows all existing window orders . a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement using the Rem@@ ove button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created with the Add button and selected views with the Rem@@ ove button .
with New column , you create a new column on the right of the existing windows , with oun@@ ds you anchor the window under the existing window , with flash@@ card you get a map @-@ map view together with the previous view and floating , the view does not appear in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without a more precise knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a sphere at a level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should observe these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to rendering , as a result you get a black picture .
if you don &apos;t insert light sources , your entire scene is in the dark and you will only get a black picture .
if you have installed everything error @-@ free , you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pres@@ et window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing toolbar icons . please read the documentation so that you get an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , first you need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit Del@@ ete menu .
this is the view of the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the content of the view object properties in which the various parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; find more details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location .
when you press the button Apply or the Enter key , the wi@@ re@@ model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , you will see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you could insert a Qu@@ ader ( insert infinite body Qu@@ ader ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a complicated method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually provides a simpler option . you can use an infinite plane as the ground :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the user button or enter the enter key . in the object tree the new name will be immediately displayed .
the wire model view now also displays the level , even at the moment only as a limited final level . when you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon .
if you look closely at the object tree , you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor if you click on the symbol + in front of the object . in this case , you will only find the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation , and shifting . select one of these options , change also the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene , you should move the soil to the horizontal line for the exercise , just to get to know some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment choose something simple .
in both cases a dialog opens in which you can select how to insert the object . please select first sub@@ property . the pigment is then displayed in the property view ( Name = Ground @-@ Pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button Pre@@ view you will see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the preview of the pigment only shows a matte black material because you still need to enter settings for the pigment . therefore always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . also , there are many options again , but now take the easiest .
if you don &apos;t see any color on the Qu@@ ader and Ball in the preview , just click on the Apply button and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you are rendering your picture now with a click on the symbol , you should get the following result :
in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called one @-@ colored . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more frequently , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , select one color each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
you should be able to do this step simply because you should have already understood the basic principles of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the sphere can be created just as easily as the ground :
in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to press the Enter key or Apply button ) , so the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground as you have moved the base to one unit down .
of course , rendering is now a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . in the next step , put a suitable material .
if you have chosen the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already on the ground , give the sphere a pigment as color :
select the first sub@@ property and change the name for example in sphere pigment . click on ball Pig@@ ment , then select In@@ o and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish features :
then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots and click Apply or press Enter .
the brightness @-@ effect and reflection options already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal : not even selected :
you should now have a good idea of the possibilities offered to you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ trac@@ ing is a render method to create a two dimensional image of a three dimensional scene or a model .
when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots out hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) by each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected by the objects and how atmospheric effects such as fog effect .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you view the scene . without a light source you also don &apos;t see anything , the picture is just black . obviously , every scene that is to be rendered requires some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file that you created previously with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you will need to enter a name and a disk space .
re@@ covers the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage will be dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved changes in the scene .
repeat the recently und@@ one command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit Con@@ trac@@ ts .
stores the current window layout and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing layout .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , keyboard short@@ cuts and standard behavior .
opens a dialog for changing the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can add pre @-@ set short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up the toolbar . you can use this option to add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; -@@ commands .
a b@@ ump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model every diff@@ user on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both a dump map as well as for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis by applying an image file as a color chart .
&amp; D@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ball show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking on the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s ; or the Return key .
you can specify whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if a suitable fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file will be highlighted . you can exit the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the Con@@ figuration - &amp; Ku@@ ick@@ show dialog , there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , General and Processing and Sli@@ deshow , you can set the way of &amp; Ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the two others , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts for the respective windows can be specified .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color that you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
if this point is enabled , load &amp; ball show ; already the next image in the folder while you are still watching the current image . this reduces the delay when you select the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slide show .
with this option , &amp; Ku@@ ick@@ show ; when finishing the name of the recently opened folder . at the next start , &amp; D@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click the colored bar to select a background color . this will be used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in win@@ dow@@ ed mode the window is larger than the image , the background will also be filled with the selected color .
you can show &amp; ball show ; set up so that only a few of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program .
with this option , the display window will be enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
specify whether the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows on the right of the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows on the right of the input field . the default is 1 .
change the short@@ cuts for the different modes of &amp; D@@ ick@@ show here ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in one window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
displays thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
shr@@ inks the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the images . &amp; Ku@@ ick@@ show ; will also be closed when no browser window is open anymore .
display the image in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing . &amp; show@@ photograph ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
&amp; show@@ photograph ; is a fast image editing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform corrections and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photograph ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user helping his part to report at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ photograph ; make it as easy as possible to report errors or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu contains an entry reports you problems or wishes . this displays a dialog with a link . if you are using it , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes .
&amp; show@@ photograph ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ NER , then we would like to encourage you to answer questions of other users . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
the best start to participate in the show@@ piece ; to participate is to join the developer mailing list . instructions to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ cases ; .
&amp; show@@ shot ; try to give you as much control over its work processes as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ NER . to access these settings , you need to set up the settings show@@ down ; you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left side .
in the exposure indicators area , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display the colors with what you want to display in contrast . under@@ exposure should display a light color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ photograph ; displays a side@@ bar at the right edge , providing important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same side bar in image editing . you can view them by clicking on one of the five riders :
&amp; Ch@@ ann@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that do not do more than scan and save images .
&amp; Ch@@ ann@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that no longer makes them scan and save images . &amp; Ch@@ ann@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for saving each image or save the images immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format .
you can check the status of support for your scanner on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a default scanner can be placed on the command line of &amp; Ch@@ l@@ ite ; with the command ch@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner is given , then a dialog box for selecting the scanner will be opened .
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner . cancel &amp; Ch@@ ann@@ l@@ ite ; exit .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; Ch@@ ann@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) these options do not treat them particularly .
to scan a picture , the user can only start a preview scan and then scan scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also set the zoom in such a way that the entire preview will fit into the window .
when the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
when previ@@ ewing a preview in the settings , the image will be displayed in a preview window as shown below . if saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and drag ? en leads to a demo@@ lition and you get back to the main window .
the Settings button opens the dialog with the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option Before saving has to display a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user then the option must be selected .
this setting allows them the way &amp; channels to select images . opening a dialog for saving each image opens the dialog before each scanned image . if &amp; Ch@@ ann@@ l@@ ite ; to save them automatically with a generated name in a pre @-@ defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are stored at the Save without a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... change .
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the images that are automatically stored and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that is always up @-@ counted when a picture is saved .
the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . this value also changes the compression value when saving . when selecting the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button Help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; Ch@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button above starts the K@@ DE over dialog for &amp; Ch@@ l@@ ite ; the button Settings displays the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to exit &amp; Ch@@ l@@ ite ; to end .
&amp; Ch@@ l@@ ite ; is licensed under the GP@@ L and the lib@@ ks@@ ane library , which is used by &amp; Ch@@ l@@ ite ; under L@@ GP@@ L . caution : lib@@ san@@ e is licensed under the GP@@ L with an exception .
below , you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global keyboard short@@ cuts can be set up by right @-@ clicking the player window and selecting the Global Keyboard Sh@@ ort@@ cut . you can set up the specific short@@ cuts by right @-@ clicking in the player window and selecting short commands ...
you can possibly set existing multimedia keys so that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands work . this will make your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browsers , players , play@@ lists , playlist browsers and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; additionally , Amar@@ ok has some own command line options .
you should give the user a reply if the script cannot be executed because of a missing depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all required modules are present and use k@@ dialogue so that the user knows why a script does not run .
begin require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ binding v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialogue --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command ; which should be enclosed in any K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow exec@@ uting external programs and commands . to do this , the ex@@ ec ( ) function is mostly used . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends al@@ erts to all running scripts . for this , strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should continuously monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore events if there is no use for it .
configure Send the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change Indi@@ c@@ ates that a new piece is being played . the script could now and z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions more information about the new track may query ( for example , the metadata or the length of the piece ) .
volume Change defines a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths Con@@ tains the path to the selected files of the playlist when a custom menu item is cli@@ cked . sub@@ menu and it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le are also passed to allow the script to identify the cli@@ cked entry . to remove an entry you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; exit , or when the user stops a script , send &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do , for example , storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) which can optionally be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with an extended amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages right .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file per@@ missions :
if your script package is ready , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your record on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok , you can simply drag music into the playlist , instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you &apos;re looking for just a certain title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos; s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
perhaps you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which one you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is just the right thing for you . and if you still find it hard to decide , the dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists will automatically select the right music based on specific criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . furthermore , many different audio systems can be used , so YOU can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to experience your music anew !
typically , in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources you have to enter the following to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
since &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and auto@@ conf used , you should not have any trouble while comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please tell them in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that you can enable or disable at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the compile options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met so that they can be used . for more details , see the system requirements section .
activated Deb@@ ug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without difficulty using the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
in addition , if the option is off , only the playlist window is displayed ( Ju@@ K ) .
use m@@ oods bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the m@@ owing bar@@ ometer .
create atmosph@@ er@@ ically : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ le . thus the used color scheme for the m@@ oods bar@@ ometer is changed .
save mood files in the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ le compiled . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files will be stored at the location of the appropriate music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files will be stored in the Settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to be started when a browser is required .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser that is not in the list above .
save Play@@ list when you exit , save the current playlist automatically when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok , and enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist when you exit .
relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
to keep the current piece visible when changing the piece , the playlist window will pop up / off to keep the each running piece in the visible window area .
when changing to context browser , the context browser automatically switches to the context browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the fonts section you can set the use of various fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; use the otherwise gray outlined section . you can select fonts for the following area : playlist windows , player windows and context browsers . press Select ... , so you can select a font from the selection dialog .
with the selection user @-@ defined color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . for this purpose , use the color selection activated underneath for foreground and background color .
continue playback at startup , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , resume playback automatically with the piece that it has stopped at the last exit .
set up the on @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if you use on @-@ screen display , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be shown in the O@@ SD .
use own colors gives you the ability to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . clicking on the color surfaces opens the dialog for color selection . if you do not use colors , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ colors will be used .
the Display Text entry field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards , the O@@ SD can be adjusted to your needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users , so you can specify on which screen a multiple monitor environment should appear on the O@@ SD .
the flash@@ card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down sel@@ ector . some drivers enable even more settings in this card card .
the collection is used to set up all settings for your collection , including the folder and the type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes for setting how to proceed with the selected folders .
recur@@ sively Browse sub@@ folders : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the ti@@ cked and their sub@@ folders will be searched for music .
monitor changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import Play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to add all found play@@ lists to your collection folder ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will then appear in the playlist &apos;s browser .
the collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setup is required in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup will be used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok . under Calcul@@ ator : will enter the host on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . afterwards under port : the network port , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use username : and password : to enter the data needed to connect to the database .
the last@@ .@@ f@@ m card handles the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m @-@ server and create music recommendations for the current piece if necessary .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send played pieces and update the profile : this setting allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transfer the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
get similar interpre@@ ters : after activating this setting &amp; Amar@@ ok , get a list with similar interpre@@ ters to the played piece . note : you can view the list in the context browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) .
some functions , such as the O@@ SD , require that your window manager keep the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ k@@ top@@ .org . for example , Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will help for instance . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t as these provide an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library . you can locate the file by clicking in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this bug to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also app@@ end the broken file that caused the crash .
mostly this is because tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more sophisticated .
make sure all of the libraries used by &amp; Amar@@ ok were compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b was compiled with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , then this leads to crashes when editing the met@@ a information .
if you are using K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d , disable automatically when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens with a crash ) . if this is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed .
this is because many programs write data in the met@@ a @-@ information as U@@ TF @-@ 8 but do not mark them as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( Rand@@ l@@ smo@@ ker / repetition / Dynamic playlist ) always appear active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the symbol effects are ignored . in some cases , you have to click on a symbol in the control center until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok is using the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or modify / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok find the correct version first .
there are some possibilities . most installation problems are most easily solved by the help of an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to search for help . please only make a mistake there if something is related to the fix of an error in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok , only an empty playlist appears . how will there be pieces of music there ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
in order to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the start window has been converted to the statisti@@ c window . you will find it under Extras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for rating by the user , while the points are automatically calculated .
to rate pieces , the rating column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and select column show valuation . click anywhere in the new application column to specify the rating for a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your selection and then select From Play@@ list remove from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with your mouse into the playlist and drop it down , just as you would do with other files . it &apos;s as simple as : - )
in the toolbar of the playlist , next to the Add button , the button playlist can be saved . click on it .
probably the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config is missing . install x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel and install the package x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel and re@@ install it . look for lib@@ tool , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer can be found in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
none ! yes , that really is ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach so the real question must be What media types support G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support almost every imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and P@@ NG !
it may ! you may use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which in default will not include any MP3 deco@@ ders ( for patent reasons ) .
start the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer enables several applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously stream audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( Software @-@ Mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify a different sink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) .
do not forget that media must first be deco@@ ded . you can &apos;t just send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you only want to hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . enable sound servers with the highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia code@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . enlar@@ ging the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either you do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia complete to get the faster Arts code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was strongly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the Control Centre and Sound &amp; Multimedia , Sound System .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to change to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; off . why ?
once you have installed G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all of the components . execute a register to register all the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask for the IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( finish Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer ( you will find the module folder with the most recent config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run the log @-@ register again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
please report to us at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes , please send them to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . also , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and run the alarm to this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command leaves &amp; Amar@@ ok ; playback start . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you wake up from the soft tones of the music you have stopped from going to bed .
how to get the current title in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running titles if you are on another computer ?
if there is a working SSH environment , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the running piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa your@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user your@@ name Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace the IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes that your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ windows . press the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will open in an independent window in the size .
the combination of C@@ trl + Right mouse button provides a piece in the click sequence in the queue . pressing the Enter key after a search in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky functions , but what about the icon in the Control bar &apos;s system section ?
with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s , click on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers to display .
my Personal Fol@@ der $ HO@@ ME is located on an NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok , the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console .
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click on Audio CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . instead , instead , take files from the folders mp3 or o@@ gg .
Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ;
basically , this fits the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the piece was played . the more often the play was played , the less influence each single rating has on the overall result .
you can add the valuation for a piece by right @-@ clicking on a column heading in the playlist window . then , you can change the valuation of a piece exactly as all other attributes , namely by right @-@ clicking on the piece and editing : select review or pressing F2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the dialog Met@@ adata dialog .
the developers do not want to tell you when to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed publishing plan that is not to be put together with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new function in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find ner@@ vi@@ g . disable the option icon when playing anim@@ ate in the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the toolbar . select Tool@@ bars to set up ... and make the desired changes there .
download a design , or create your own . install it then under Amar@@ ok ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance Con@@ text browser design , click on New Design ....
the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties it was removed .
Kon@@ quer@@ or &apos;s navigation area allows you to monitor &amp; control Amar@@ ok , while browsing in Kon@@ quer@@ or . then start Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation area . then click the Settings button ( the top ) and select the Add Amar@@ ok drop @-@ down menu .
audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free username and password . Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler will be fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok .
if you want to use AL@@ SA , then please the latest version available . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore a lot of bug reports .
probably became &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine didn &apos;t compile these output modules . you must &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ?
probably you use a distribution that inst@@ alls the development files separately from the actual program . even though G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , you will need to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel package . the same goes for x@@ ine , you must install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you have to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel .
I receive the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos;@@ Ad@@ der &apos;@@ has no type .. How can I correct this ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , even though the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
in order to be able to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module must be installed next to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad .
you will get the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play an MP3 stream , but the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad module is not installed . install the module and then run as system administrator register . then restart Amar@@ ok .
I have a second sound@@ card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use Amar@@ ok the second sound card ?
set up Am@@ ok under Settings ... Audio Output enter the device . typically , for example , h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with on@@ board AC@@ 97 code@@ c and a USB audio device :
p@@ c@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 ( type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ intel@@ li@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
enter us@@ b @-@ audio in the setup dialog of x@@ ine now , and the output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of the sampling rate , channels and so on .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the check box on sound card support m@@ map .
sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not further looked after . of course , you can take this issue yourself ! if you want , you can become the new so urgently required main@@ tain@@ er for Arts : )
listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard which will be displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to update your collection afterwards , or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , then this quick start guide will help you . with your help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes .
creating a playlist is very easy . drag the mouse to the playlist from the collection browser . the small text box for filtering the collection makes it easier for you to search for certain pieces . if you are satisfied with the playlist , you can save it with the button playlist from the playlist . you will find this button in the toolbar of the playlist window .

the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , the left side is the navigation pane . in the navigation area , you will find some of the most excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser .
the context browser displays different information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser designs . the context browser contains three sub @-@ windows : music , text and artist . these three sub @-@ windows are later more detailed .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you might notice that the start window has fallen away . the information shown there is now available in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; moreover , the information can be collected in the statistics window ( Extras statistics ) .
the music sub@@ window displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the artist and the album .
the first area in this sub @-@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to track the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
you can find more information about the current piece under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
to display cover images in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats are .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ ng . the images can have any name but pictures with the word front in the name are preferred . the context browser will also display cover images that have either been downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
the next area , Recommen@@ ded Pi@@ ec@@ es , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will play inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ously .
among the suggested pieces are the favorite pieces of this artist . this section displays the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can choose which information should be displayed in the music sub@@ window . to do so , right @-@ click anywhere in the sub @-@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , artist &apos;s albums , lists all the albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be worked out and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all the pieces in the individual fields to start playing immediately . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
this function is very flexible and it is possible to download text from other web pages with the help of self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click the text sub@@ window , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is still running , you can choose which to start .
the Edit button allows you to edit the song text . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database .
the Search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the lyrics for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Artist - group@@ ed only the top layer , each piece is displayed directly below the artist . albums or genres are ignored .
group@@ ing Artist / Album - First the pieces are arranged according to the artist and a further division is made according to the respective album . if you want to see compositions or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums will be displayed in different interpre@@ ters at the beginning of the list .
group@@ ing Artist / year - album - sorted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically by each other . the interpreter will be ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - Your pieces are first sorted by genre and among them by artist .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works just like the above but is additionally sorted by album below the artist .
with the help of the remaining buttons you can customize and combine the group@@ ing at will .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically re @-@ capture your collection once you change something to the selected folders . if you own lots of pieces , this might take a while .
a search filter is located directly beneath the toolbar . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . instructions for using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual .
under the search filter is a selection box , with which help you can filter the last added pieces to your collection . you can also select different time windows , starting from the last 24 hours to a year .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will get the following options .
load - This is the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order .
app@@ end to Play@@ list - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on one entry , you can reach the same effect .
set pieces in queue - This feature adds the selected pieces to the queue . this will then be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as play@@ lists . you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
transfer the pieces to the Media Player to transfer the pieces to the Media @-@ Player . for more details , see the Media @-@ Player section .
burn all pieces of this artist to CD - This means that the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned as data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
edit Met@@ adata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open the item information dialog and let the tags for one or more pieces change .
( s ) Del@@ ete files into the tr@@ ash bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm it , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
mark the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears under different interpre@@ ters .
cancel compilation - Chan@@ ges a compilation selected as a compilation album back into a normal album . afterwards , the album will no longer be displayed under different interpre@@ ters , but again under the respective interpreter .
the play@@ lists browser makes it easy to handle many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes intelligent play@@ lists .
the lower part of the playlist &apos;s browser contains the smart play@@ lists . this use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that has never been played yet .
even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click Smart Play@@ lists to open the dialog to create a new Smart Play@@ list . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the Media Player sub@@ window is used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod according to artist sorted in the top list view of the media player browser .
to transfer plays to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them to the list Artist . if you &apos;re done , click Apply . this will then upload the pieces to your iPod . when the transmission is complete , finish &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and trigger the drive connection for your iPod .
under the toolbar you can find a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser you will find an address bar that allows you to get music from a typ@@ ed URL . if you enter tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press Enter key , you can listen to music in the musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z file . now you can drag the music from there to the playlist and drop it .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , the mounting of files by simply dropping can be difficult . in this case the holding of the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically insert drop @-@ down files at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
you can change the order by simply dra@@ gging the entries with the mouse to the desired location . once you enter letters , only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again .
if you enter search terms separated by whit@@ esp@@ ace , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries that contain all search terms . for example , if you enter one two three , the search will find all entries containing one , two and three .
if you enter OR between the search terms , search for entries that either contain one or the other keyword . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) .
if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then en@@ close the search term with go@@ ose @-@ feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that Mike Old@@ field contain , but not by entries like Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a specific search column , you can search for larger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . This searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something is looking for pieces that do not contain anything .
you can combine these syntax variants at will . example : Mike Old@@ field OR scores : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bath .
you can set the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ trl key , and then right @-@ clicking on the entries in the desired order . the entries will then be marked with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some features of the playlist . on the left hand side , you find the Add , with which you can add the play@@ lists to the right .
next , the buttons will follow und@@ o and restore . this allows you to und@@ o or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the tool bar is a unique , larger analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the toolbar is menu . it opens the same menu as that which you get displayed in the player window over the right mouse button . you can set up the configuration via this menu .
there are many more available buttons for the toolbar , for example , Play@@ back Control and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and setting up toolbar buttons .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for access mode and retri@@ eval is displayed by clicking twice in the appropriate display area with the mouse .
you can also hide the status bar . to do this disable the Status Bar option in the General Settings .
the context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking in the playlist on the menu . via this menu , you can reach the Settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
a click on this entry opens the Windows Visu@@ alization Plugins . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; select .
behind this entry hides a sub@@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start them by selecting promotional code management in the collection browser .
the cover management includes a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the performer on the left @-@ hand side .
with the View menu , you can choose what to display in the cover administration . select from :
the queue management received your big entry in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature , you have even more control over the playlist . after you set a piece into the queue , a number next to the title appears in the playlist . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 will be played first , 2 second , and so on .
if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the item in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces to the playlist or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre @-@ specified ( the details of setting up these later ) .
fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds random pieces during playback .
adds fragments based on load .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audio @-@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces already exist in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a load .@@ f@@ m profile to make this dynamic playlist work .
double @-@ click the desired playlist , drag it to the playlist window or right @-@ click on it and then select Load . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced with the new playlist .
the two pre @-@ set modes of the Mix and Play@@ lists Mix instantly fill up your playlist and you can start playing directly . the playlist received starts with an empty playlist and you will need to add at least one piece from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added at the next part change , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the last possible dynamic mode : settings of Dynamic Mode . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . using the same menu entry , the dynamic mode can also be disabled again .
the New Ref@@ er button cle@@ ars the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . edit Play@@ list opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings .
with a right click on a dynamic playlist , you have the ability to click Edit . then the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings .
enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique in order to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming tracks will be ski@@ pped and they will not hear twice in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the played pieces will be removed while respecting the setting .
played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see which pieces were recently played .
this is the number of pieces that you want to add to the playlist after each played piece . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will grow continuously , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the right @-@ hand settings are already described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you cross multiple play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; add random items from each of the play@@ lists you have crossed .
some scripts will allow you to set your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then clicking on the set @-@ up menu .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; install scripts by clicking on the script . a new entry will open in the list . after you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .
if you no longer want to use a script , you can delete it . to do so , select the script to delete and then click Un@@ install .
if you are looking for information about writing your own scripts , please refer to the section Writ@@ ing of Scrip@@ ts .
the dialog window visualization plug@@ ins is used to enable the available visu@@ aliz@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plug@@ ins . to use a plug @-@ in , simply activate the check box next to the name .
this Quick Start is designed to show you how to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps you can create an audio CD . to understand the steps you need to have a running installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog box where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 or other loss@@ less compressed formats , remember that when encoding is again , you will get a po@@ orer quality , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD has been created by a los@@ sy format .
in this dialog you can do nothing . please wait until the computer has finished the burning process .
this Quick Start is to show you how to copy &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; copy a data CD in just four steps . to understand the steps you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have inserted the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
to copy a data CD , please select Extras , copy CD ... from the menu . you now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning .
after you have made all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; settings , please press the Start button . you will now see a dialog that looks like this :
in this dialog , you can track the progress of the copy process . once the original image is completed to the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD media to which the data should be burned .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; Burn the image file . you must now wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; Burn the image file . you must now wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
the Q@@ T designer tool U@@ IC can &apos;t find the wid@@ get modules . to fix this issue start q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / li@@ b / k@@ de@@ 3 / plug@@ ins to the search path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS by your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .

c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . in the Internet such programs are generally referred to as Ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional technology for audio encoding and for dealing with audio streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from Open Source and stands in direct competition to MP3 .
M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 En@@ co@@ der module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code@@ c for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ MPEG , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : additional libraries for processing various audio formats . with FF@@ MPEG , for example , it is possible to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burn them on an audio CD . de@@ co

V@@ C@@ DI@@ A : a fully featured author system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analy@@ zing video CDs and super video CDs .
Norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . for example , this can make sense to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different record levels of the different albums can lead to the in@@ appropriate effect that the music pieces will play differently loud .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to run from CD and to automatically play all videos in the basic folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . click on one entry to open the project .
save the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise a new file name will be asked .
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is displayed , with which you can select folder and file name for the project file .
saves all open projects . that &apos;s the same as if you would call Save for each project file .
closes the current project . if a project has been modified and not saved yet , asks &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what should happen . you can then choose between saving and changes . you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project what to do with it , as if you had called for any project file .
closes all open projects and ends &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for every un@@ saved project , you will be asked what to do with it , as if you had called file closing .
if you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . it has the same effect as if you view the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the files added will appear in the basic folder of the CD .
this dialog is basically the same as the Project Properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the medium . the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data .
open the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described via the What is the ? -@@ Rem@@ ove ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry will only appear with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from an previous session into the current project . this is useful when using files for a multiple session CD . it is rather intended for you rather than help so that you can see the files and folders that already exist on the medium .
this entry will only appear with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files will remain in the project .
this also allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can also create an image from a CD which you can burn later on . you should also prefer cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
this also allows to copy DVD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can also create an image from a DVD that you can burn later . furthermore , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . furthermore , the target medium must be large enough to accommodate the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form .
to delete a CD @-@ RW , you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
this dialog allows you to format a DVD ± R ( W ) , which completely del@@ etes the contents . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
burn a previously created CD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the Burn button . ( Ner@@ o * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , therefore you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burns a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the Burn button .
a previously used DVD video can be converted . this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used as a stand@@ alone . it contains information about the selected video , encoding settings , and even possibilities for changing the size and trimm@@ ing black edges .
displays information about the inserted media . this information is displayed in the content view and contains the properties of the medium , such as the size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is enabled , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is enabled , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view contains an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , its contents will be displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locking and blocking of the drive or e@@ ject the medium .
the content view allows you to select and drag files into the project view . the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
the header is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header has no real function , it looks pretty and separates the projector view clearly from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog box to change the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key assignment further down .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows the correct auth@@ oriz@@ ations to be set for burning CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administrator rights are required , so you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when the wizard is started .
open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general application settings can be done . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work straight away . this dialog is intended for person@@ alizing and fine adjustment of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script , for example .
to use the D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program , or the slightly more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and the type of your task will be decisive .
in this chapter , we assume that you use the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P , you must make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then enter something like the following :
besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that all &amp; k@@ de ; program have in common , supported &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides features such as copy@@ CD , format DVD and other functions for creating new projects .
projects ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ x@@ Project method one gets a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively , a project can be created via the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project received via # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ string Transpar@@ ent ) void remo@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string new@@ Name ) void set@@ Volume ( Q@@ string id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders , and then adds files to the new folders :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ reader for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it can easily be read audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . other formats are also possible depending on encoder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; files in WAV files on hard disk ) and from many enco@@ ders that en@@ code these WAV files ( these enco@@ ders must still be installed from the Linux distribution ) . other enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the title of the &amp; CD ; read out and saved in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these wa@@ v files ( usually one per cap@@ tion ) are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or also in other formats such as the loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it needs to be done now .
for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . all these programs are usually already existing for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is very likely not necessary to compile anything themselves . if , for example , FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is also not necessary .
which encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as I said , &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to crack any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device handles the protection , it is not possible to read a protected audio CD ; just avoid the purchase of copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only once has to be done ( the setup dialog can be called up so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , the daily handling of reading a &amp; CD ; explained to the hard drive . this ( hopefully ) leads to the understanding of the slim approach of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which encoder programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; collect information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or work completely without a network , where everything is recorded manually .
this is just a short list of the main window commands . step by step for example , you will find more information on how to use this program as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tabs for configur@@ ing the program .
starts the CD@@ DB enquiry of CD data according to the setup of request in the CD@@ DB . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case first the connection to the Internet must be established . )
starts reading and - if an encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup guide - encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders so that the selection can be read with a different encoder as the default . note that previously , the encoding settings in the encoding settings have been configured in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager so that an already selected file is selected for encoding instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , be@@ eps ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; exit ) .
opens the main home decor dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( like En@@ co@@ der , to set up the encoder ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoder .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also others like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression ratios and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but over this bit rate , the differences become less important as both enco@@ ders generate very good audio quality .
O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions
+ high to very high sound quality ( at high bit rates ) , but compared with O@@ GG slightly deeper quality at lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playback devices is present .
MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto stereo systems .
a short list of audio quality parameters and the resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . always needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a song . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression ratio approx . 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a song . good enough for music by teenagers , portable devices and auto@@ stere@@ os . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you want absolutely the highest quality regardless of the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is entered manually or automatically retri@@ eved from the fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / use with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD title to the keywords ( English : tag ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; added . the result looks like &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download information instead of entering the computer . note that only text is spoken here : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ les , artists , names of the pieces , etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translator ) am not lawyer . however , no one can prevent that you from the &amp; CD ; publish information publicly available on the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is actively a check box to select ( sending an address ) . for use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( fake ) address than the one installed in the system . in this type of configuration , it seems , the e @-@ mail address is not used when calling the data from the server ( This may only know the programmer who checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the computers .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to store tunes from the &amp; CD ; to save in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; if you want to know more exactly , search in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the right distribution if this has not happened yet .
to save the read wa@@ v files , the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected . the first opening contains pre@@ defined l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss @-@ free compression for audio data ) on the encoding tab . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab itself .
the encoder package must be installed from the concerned lin@@ ux distribution before the encoder can be used . this is also required for pre@@ defined enco@@ ders . more information about enco@@ ders is in the section Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a encoder , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD disk , the write and reading real , and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio encoder of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you do not want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check the envelope of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we &apos;ll use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps in average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . for example , a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found with a search engine , as it is considered not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission ( eg ; by trying to copy something into it with the kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic set @-@ up of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something that is probably only done once and
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; which needs to be repeated for each read @-@ out &amp; CD .
here we define the enco@@ ders to be used for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them every time you read a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is passed to the reading program so it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive exists , the effective device name can also be specified . if the drive can be accessed with other programs , then a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device desig@@ nations for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the Map General Settings . here is not much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will be left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
in case of incomplete information , select promp@@ ts so that you will be informed when data to create keyword ( tags ) is missing .
the card card CD ; -@@ settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and allow the &amp; CD ; data automatically downloaded from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer via the Internet .
note : the computer must be connected to the fre@@ ed@@ b server during reading the &amp; CD , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second sel@@ ector is simpler , if a &amp; CD ; record is found , immediately starts reading the &amp; CD ; . this is associated with low risk , if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory and fil@@ en@@ ame is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or@@ - &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to manually enter everything manually , disable the sel@@ ector fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . you can work with fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode when you download the database before . however , this is over 6@@ 20 MB big , consider this twice whether this is worth it . to make fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for invo@@ king the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . set everything as shown in the screen@@ shot .
mode : we haven &apos;t downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server in your area . on this path the load is distributed among the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work on the same level as the server , but as many fire@@ walls bo@@ ck@@ down the 88@@ 80 protocol by default , there may be more luck with the 80 protocol , because the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet .
in this example we do not want to send any data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . the first check box should suff@@ ice .
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the / tmp directory exists on your computer )
number of pieces at the same time : sorry , is there a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author does not know , therefore simply try himself .
CD ; after reading the last piece : check this for the &amp; CD ; disc@@ ard at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must the path / folder specified in which the WAV files are saved . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder if you want to do something with the wa@@ v files yourself .
enter everything as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be smoo@@ thed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is sufficient for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit rate is average about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression ratio is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the creation of tags to V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags may also be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneously enco@@ ded wa@@ v files : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than one WAV file simultaneously .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music clever@@ ly , you never need to change it again .
this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; runs on the hard disk . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , has been described in the previous section . first , a connection to the Internet is set up as we are comfortable and want to fetch data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . the process described in this section must be repeated for each read @-@ out &amp; CD .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a bit different from that for a &amp; CD ; with success of fre@@ ed@@ b collected data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data to be entered manually instead of extrac@@ ting them from the internet . comments will indicate the differences .
don &apos;t try to find the &amp; CD , this example . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this has not happened yet , now the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; can be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , check out the Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers section for help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD was successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all tracks are filled out and the name of the artist and the album is also displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; a window will appear and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD .
if you have not selected the check box for automatic retri@@ eval of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button on the toolbar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but fetch the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - Input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer needs to be entered in the input field &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; unless you have compiled a compilation of different artists for each piece .
the comment field below may be used for individual comments per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD .
caution : after successfully retri@@ eving data from the fre@@ ed@@ b , the CD @-@ editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the screen@@ shot below . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist &apos;s and album name ( e.g. if all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment field . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum allowed .
you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the help section for more information .
simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the out@@ going CD ; in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD data anyway . for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or ra@@ p for example are found under Rock .
after selecting &apos; OK &apos; , go back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button on the toolbar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the parts list .
note that it has a check character before each line of a piece . only the titles that are marked as selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece one or off . make sure all pieces are selected , or press the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once .
if the selection process is started by clicking on the selection button , this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on .
click on the Tas@@ ks button to switch to the order window . it is located in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the toolbar .
this is the window to control orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message will see if you try to work with a code that you haven &apos;t installed yet . pieces that have not been successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have typ@@ ed here in the example . have you checked whether you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of reading the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . this takes place reading and coding in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding . the machine used with an AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have a problem with simultaneous reading and coding ( but two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order placed in the queue of the coding . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window is displayed with a message for a short time in the top left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the encoder of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; used today within the &amp; k@@ de ; CVS is part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package . if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . however , most distri@@ butions contain already a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you read this , you probably already did it ...
this section is aimed at people who compile from source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help like the program can be adjusted to your needs once it is running , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different programs has many different settings . it is best to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen@@ shots of the different flash@@ cards of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example .
hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after starting the program , without any clu@@ e as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD in the drive at the time of the program start ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it all about ? whoever reads this has probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author cannot keep this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; whoever wants to add something useful or change it may do it . at least only after cont@@ acting with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and therefore agrees with this proposal .
strange if you managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke game of &amp; k@@ de ; and besides others , he also has some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke @-@ real@@ time high@@ lighting of texts also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so should work on all O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de systems ; &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver needed for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the track .
graphical representation of the activity of any MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag and drop allowing you to drag and drop any MIDI file from one &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows to k@@ mid .
supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the process used .
if you &amp; k@@ de ; when you finish playing a song , k@@ mid will start again next time with the same song .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it will appear the usual file dialog with which help you can select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; drop windows into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . this also works with multiple songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the toolbar , select &quot; Play &quot; from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece will automatically start as soon as you move it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played one after the other . )
as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and moving back and forth with the controller .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows left and right of the tempo gauge and change the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double @-@ click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar appears as pressing the pause or selecting the menu entry Pause in the menu item , thus interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no play is played , start &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in two types in one piece of music . some pieces use text file , others use lyrics event and other both . some pieces do not have any lyrics at all : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically calculated , which uses a song , so you don &apos;t have to manually set it . so , if you want to enable automatic text output in the Settings menu , the kar@@ aoke text is automatically selected .
if you want to specify an event type , select the Text In@@ puts and / or Love events from the Settings menu . the same function also has the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you summari@@ ze . these are played in series . this section shows how you can efficiently use collections .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you can find it in the collection under the item Organ@@ ize .... Click on New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking copy and then giving the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original one .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the desired number in the collection manager .
the temporary collection includes all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when you leave the application , this collection is not saved . consider this if you add a lot of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , you have to be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the Add button . in turn , the file dialog appears , with which help you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on the setting Automati@@ cally add to the collection .
when automatic add to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Drag &amp; Drop ) .
if automatic add to the collection is not enabled , when opening a piece , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then be added to the opened pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs will be played . if you select the series from the sub @-@ menu of the menu collections , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection .
when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to skip a song , select the Next song button , enter the next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right .
to flip back a song , select the Previous portion button , select the Previous item from the menu item or press the arrow left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , it does not matter as it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers that are not General MIDI capability . in this case , the MIDI Map transl@@ ates General MIDI events into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type , making a trumpet sound if you originally should play a piano .
if you only have one sound card , you do not need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM equipment and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI maps , so you need to edit the appropriate file manually ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all the necessary settings for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text id ( see below ) .
def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Ano@@ ther Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is used to indicate that a section begins ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail so that I can support in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be for devices that are not general MIDI compatible .
in this section you will see how to display the patches of General MIDI to your specific keyboard . general usage looks like this :
please note that the left side of the identity sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all the sounds that this instrument needs to play on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a gun ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) that sounds similar to a gun . to do this , enter the following into the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 ( bul@@ let ) , it will take patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that the word &quot; Dr@@ um@@ ming Patch &quot; refers to a different percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as , etc ; ) , and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) .
the key@@ map section is used to specify sounds on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , just as its presence . so you have to create 128 entries .
you can define several key maps for each channel and instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ maps are used mainly to make sounds on the perc@@ ussions channel . take a look at the provided Key@@ maps as an example .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swap the first and second channel , just make it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards that have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel that is m@@ apped to the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map is used with the name Name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events that attempt to change the patch on this channel will be ignored . in this case , patch x will always be used .
the option For@@ ce@@ Patch can be useful for example to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the perc@@ ussions channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates in which ratio P@@ itch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multiplied . so if a MIDI file sends a pitch Ben@@ der event with the value n , it is converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM provides that a keyboard that gets a pitch Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards will try to play two sounds up to an oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; around .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . this can be found in the Settings menu , point MIDI Settings
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which sounds are being played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button lights no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view ( up to now ) has two different views to display the played sounds . in the Settings menu , select Settings under the point of the channel view : settings
the speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find e.g. a song is too fast to follow the lyrics , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how a piece of music needs to be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , etc . thus , the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
well , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed , etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; that &apos;s because &amp; k@@ mid ; compiled without AW@@ E support . to eliminate the problem , you need to download and install a source distribution ( e.g. from k@@ mid ; &apos; s start page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
agree to support &amp; k@@ mid ; Drag &amp; Drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ windows .
by default , enable automatic add to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow the playback . to restore the standard speed , you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have a &amp; k@@ de ; Desktop ein &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Windows with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( when I play a MIDI file ) or attached ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) .
if you only want to quickly listen to a file without adding it to a collection , turn the Automati@@ cally Add to collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ Ther@@ m . first , you only want to play the first file . so , set the Automati@@ cally Add to collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! when I listen to these songs or see the postcard , that anim@@ ates me to program on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Mal@@ aga ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Mal@@ aga . at the moment I am in the third year , so I don &apos;t have much leisure time for my hob@@ bies but I still try to collect MIDI files , make music and prove sentences .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , send me an email : lar@@ pink @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
they make me really happy if you send me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all of them send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will count among friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; but before you send a MIDI file , you should contact me , as I may already have the file .
I &apos;ve written &amp; k@@ mid ; written entirely in my spare time and never got money from anyone for it . I would like to emphasize that I am only interested in programming , because / when I get feedback from users ( post cards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch of AW@@ E cards was too high .

in addition , &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on his homepage , which is found under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ pink / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . you can also follow the development , search for information and view images on the homepage .
a sound card . I recommend a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use an FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound@@ card , you need to compile and compile with the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL parameter . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can &apos;t listen to music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and FF@@ MPEG . the program is used to play video files that supported by M@@ Player or Phon@@ on supported formats , as well as for playback of DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the website The K@@ DE website for new versions , or to send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Ma@@ iling list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is returned in it .
it is possible to save the preferred connections under the menu book@@ mark , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played by each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent Play@@ list .
of course you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarch@@ ical level . if you click on an entry , its group and all its sub @-@ groups are copied to the current category and playback starts with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , TV and permanent play@@ lists can also be changed by editing XML configuration files . of course you can only do this if &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; not running . the various files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / directory can be changed by an editor , from the menu view and next editing mode . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , select Play@@ lists from the menu and select either the Edit mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost if the editing mode is left or another group is selected without comparing it to the playlist .
due to the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; some functions can only be enabled by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation at startup and exit can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and changing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ ble option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be inserted easily .
it is also possible to enable another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / ww@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation at startup doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . this would be disturbing for the end @-@ animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photographer : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ correctly &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / lt ; / sm@@ il@@ ted ; In the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L are supported by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; supported .
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the Con@@ figuration dialog of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; here the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things can be set .
another tool for troubleshooting is the &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; button in the toolbar of K@@ M@@ Player . here is the output of mp@@ layer visible .
there is no tab for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c , just like setting up the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; is played with the module sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even insert the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
for the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; to play &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; module as a service provider for the mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file Reg@@ ulations of K@@ DE must be specified .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and searched for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . if there are no errors , the Back@@ end Edition is within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to check ) .
in order to always take a given back@@ end for a certain mim@@ e type ( of course only if this was also determined ) , this must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c . for example , Phon@@ on should play all o@@ gg files :
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either via M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before watching TV , the device and the TV channels need to be configured . for this purpose , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing V@@ DR ( Video data recorder ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player , the dialog box in the Settings is under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be detected ports from which one is selected . the encoding must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for Western Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ d in it .
since the V@@ DR support of K@@ M@@ Player only X@@ Video can use , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this way of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . therefore , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server must be functional . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must contain the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig )
internally , K@@ M@@ Player uses different names for the sources . at the time of creating this documentation , these are dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ en.@@ When enabled , they start playing the playlist .
is there any hint of how I can make my CD@@ ROM drive more quiet if I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command HD@@ PAR@@ M -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is the user root to run the device . it is absolutely certain to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom indicates the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts slowly , why do I have to check my CPU for performance every time ?
note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ x@@ t. k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and networking support , and is needed to compile &amp; dump .
latex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to rely on the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the Linux distri@@ butions used &amp; Linux . for installation , documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; Project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages from &amp; Ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . they enable easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of experience with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users probably don &apos;t have to read this manual . however , all the suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is requested , contact via the box ; website should be made .
if you have any questions or if you want to compile and / or add extensions , this should be addressed to the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated and latex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; - desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers the possibility to use all and latex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all and latex ; programs . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; latex ; reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; Po@@ sters ; and its ways to experience the manual of K@@ ate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter &apos;s work with the Editor of &amp; Po@@ sters .
for and latex ; is the correct language : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the initial &amp; tex ; difficult to operate , a lay@@ man ( engl@@ ish@@ lay ) &amp; latex ; -@@ mac@@ ros can also use . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while here only a good overview of and latex is given , it is not the ultimate book on it . to be able to master correctly , good books e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to and latex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , may be consul@@ ted in 1999 .
the introduction contains at least the command \ \ document@@ s.com , the body starts with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again using the command \ \ end { document } .
the quick entry assistant of &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for spe@@ edy creation of a document in &amp; box ; the selection of the wizard ( Men@@ Ã ¼ r ) offers some options for creating the document . there can also be some settings related to the document .
document classes : this introduces the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , report &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ d@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ d@@ cl &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ book &#93; , film &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined .
encoding : this is used to set the encoding of the system . modern systems are increasingly using U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be selected ( for correct processing of &amp; latex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used additional packages for and latex ; they must be selected only in the check box for the integration .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . you should always find use in creating German texts .
new users do not have to worry . it is merely a brief description of the functions and further information is given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - as well as other source code editors - high@@ lighting the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by viewing large areas of a green text on the screen , it is likely that any mathematical environment has not been closed .
with automatic completion of environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) from &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically generates an empty line ( to enter the text ) and the associated line to the command of the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be disabled in the Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; latex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document to be divided into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ paragraph the bottom element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of a mouse .
when creating your own &amp; latex ; files can be very helpful for searching . as soon as a DVI file is created , you can jump &amp; drop ; by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; latex ; source code .
a DVI file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information like the font and besides PDF is the other output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; . there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the scroll search , the elements of the DVI ; file with the editor are cli@@ pped and once cli@@ cked to an element in the DVI file ; the exact opposite of it . as soon as a section in the &amp; latex ; source text has been cli@@ cked , the corresponding place is j@@ umped into the DVI ; -@@ viewer .
master document : this feature is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , the work is simplified with other .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set about project settings .
fast building : the &amp; latex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no source code errors ) .
video surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is recorded in the &quot; A@@ w@@ eder@@ ungen@@ â &quot; in this mode , and there is no call from &amp; oc@@ epi@@ ece ; after the fast construction .
when viewing the Edit tool bar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection fields have been developed for the quick insertion of common elements into the document . the first drop @-@ down box is for the quick structure of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The available and latex ; instructions for sub@@ division are :
the Other is for inser@@ ting items such as keywords , notes or notes . the available options are :
name : with this command a name for a section , a picture or other element is created .
reference : is used for reference to a specified term ( selection via a selection box possible ) .
when using quote , a selection list with literary entries is displayed . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file belongs to a project . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; ki@@ le ; by hand .
the last drop @-@ down box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ e is used for the definition of the Sets . there can be set the Sets for the main text , the notes no@@ des , etc . the following types of fonts are available :
when calling &amp; Ki@@ le ; two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written from scratch by hand .
the par@@ enth@@ eses after the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; defines the Sets . if the font is not set at the beginning , this can also occur in the text .
once the source code above has been entered , the &amp; latex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is the use of the Men@@ em Building or the Schnell@@ start button .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; it automatically exec@@ utes the storage .
if the document is comp@@ iling , it should be searched for errors in the logging process . if fast construction is used , the ey@@ epi@@ ece should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the recording should also be considered .
an environment ( environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the written text 12 is created and only a few columns should have a different type . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } .
the changes will be supervised only within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ end { environment } ) . there is no limit ( number ) for changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and ease of use of the document . for example , certain fonts , bold , ital@@ ics , under@@ scores , etc. can be added . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for recur@@ sive printing and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in a set can be itali@@ ci@@ zed with \ \ emp@@ h { Word } itali@@ c .
\ \ quot@@ a : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
after the background for writing the source text with the &amp; latex ; drawing language has been presented , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le follows .
once a bit of text has been entered in the wizard , a few adjustments should be made for the better read@@ ability of the document . for this purpose , a quote , a few paragra@@ phs in bold and itali@@ c pressure and a poem should be applied to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , the editor View or Str@@ g E can be returned to the editor ( in the case of an internal viewer ) .
once the DVI file is created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try out and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format ( eng . D e V ice I n@@ cl ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed using a file ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool bar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI file is created from the &amp; latex ; source code , the conversion can begin in desired other formats using the buttons in the toolbar .
the preview function allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI file ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a corresponding setting for all and latex ; bin@@ aries . to do this , simply set up Modern under Settings box ... Construction can be selected .
in order to execute the pre @-@ selection , the mouse @-@ cursor must be positioned in a row of the source text and then cli@@ cked on forward looking . the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer is then taken .
with this function in &amp; Oc@@ ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; latex ; -@@ document from &amp; Ki@@ le ; opened and j@@ umped into the corresponding line . to do this , &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; Oc@@ ey@@ epi@@ ece ; set up as text editor ( setting up settings ... editor )
should an error occur when using the &amp; DVI file ; if there is an error , this will be displayed in the logging file or in the message window .
the log file explains the source of errors in the source code . in the editor , the buttons pre@@ defined La@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used for le@@ aps between errors . to view the faulty line , you have to click on the error in the logging and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jumps to the wrong line .
once the button in the toolbar is cli@@ cked , a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document . the default options are :
when selecting empty documents , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document . more information on this can be found in the section .
hands @-@ on users of &amp; latex ; mostly use the same introduction for virtually all documents . templates can be created in &amp; box ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file must be opened or a new file is created . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting File Tem@@ plate from document ...
when creating a new document from a template by file New , some strings are replaced with other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) .
when creating your own template it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by typing in document class . typically it is used as a file : \ \ document@@ s.com &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93;
the easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document is created in this way , the following steps must be executed :
when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the standard ones .
a template can be created from any &amp; latex ; files . if an easy way to create a template is required , it should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described under described steps should be executed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; Po@@ sters ; as an internal editor . &amp; Po@@ sters ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and empha@@ sizing from many different types of text files ( including also &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
to find out more and its possibilities , the manual of K@@ ate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter &apos;s work with the Editor of &amp; Po@@ sters .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; latex ; command reference , which can be called by the menu La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a conc@@ ise description of almost all commands which can be found in &amp; latex ; use and its syntax .
double @-@ click with pressed C@@ trl key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that when the \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
when dra@@ gging the text with left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse and emphasize different kinds of source texts . for example , the &amp; latex ; orders from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color .
many assistants can add additional jump marks . this is a separate type of book@@ marks within the text . the menu entries do highlight the jump to the next or last jump mark . this is also highlighted , so that it is automatically deleted when typing a character .
the editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; Ki@@ le ; although &amp; Po@@ sters ; already excellent possibilities were added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; latex ; source code added . &amp; latex ; special commands for their selection . under Edit Selec@@ ting are the following commands for selecting text :
he@@ als a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing an empty line on both sides ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; latex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . the only explo@@ iting thing in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is that the yields are separated by two blank lines .
this selection also has an extended meaning since this command also contains and latex ; -@@ commands with a running lash ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
for removing part of the document , it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; Po@@ sters ; offers the key C@@ trl + K with which the entire row is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers with own commands for faster possibility .
removed a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is included in the description to modify the selection item .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in and latex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; for more orders under Edit environment for a fully simple work with and latex ; .
this command is used to jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command is used to jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the surrounding area .
when the cursor is in front of or within the command \ \ begin { environment } , the cursor jumps to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted environment commands , the Overview of the surrounding environment can be quickly lost . this command will close the recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted surrounding structure will not be destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; latex ; groups , which are determined by clips { ... } . under Edit te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to those from the Edit environment .
this command j@@ umped at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket .
this command is used to jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) .
when the cursor is in front of or behind the sc@@ aled bracket of a &amp; tex ; group # , the group will jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted sh@@ utter@@ ed groups @-@ clas@@ ps it can quickly become lost . this command joins the recently opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups is not destroyed .
in &amp; latex ; two simple suits are used as sem@@ inal ves@@ icles . for the beneficial implementation is used in &amp; ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; used for two simple suits . &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and leads to two connecting notes for and latex ; one .
this automatic insert of double quotes can be set up under Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
you can also use specific settings ( e.g. n@@ au@@ di or French ) and there@@ with German or French suits . there are also many other languages available .
while holding Shift + Enter key , enter an intelligent line break . if the current position is located within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not just a line break , but at the same time the command \ \ item .
within a table environment , the current line with \ \ \ \ associated with an adjoining line break .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set and latex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be added under Settings box ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X added .
some users want to arrange columns in tables -@@ environments and thereby all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among themselves . &amp; Ki@@ le ; tries to inv@@ ent this . by pressing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; Ki@@ le ; after the nic@@ est tab in the above row .
although &amp; Po@@ sters ; already provides good source code completion , it was added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; to include special commands ( mostly for natural latex ; ) . three of these are installed for automatic completion . all these modes can be set up for different modes of operation under Settings box ... To be set up permanently .
at the beginning a new environment is added by the command \ \ begin { environment } &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the key , the last letter of the input will be removed and er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously obsc@@ ured by this the complete list . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are , of course , removed from the selection of a command . alternatively , jump marks can be inserted , so that a simple jump to these positions is possible by editing jumps and then the desired parameters can be added .
under Settings box ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; Complete settings can be made to these lists . there can be different parts lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; commands as well as wi@@ pers of the general language used can be selected .
the command mode is not useful for the completion of environments . there are always a few letters begin to begin with \ \ begin and calling the complete defense mode will result in a large list of surrounding commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for completion of environments for disposal .
when calling the full @-@ space environment or the Shift key Alt + Shift key , the command is automatically inserted to open the environment and it appears \ \ begin . afterwards , the ambient operation can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input button .
once this is done , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; Ki@@ le recognizes that it is a list environment , a first \ \ item command will be added .
under Settings box ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; Complete settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of the complete support mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; support custom lists of changes that are immediately replaced by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings ... Ki@@ le Complete . as an example of a drop down list , the ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l file , for example , is included in the L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X entry .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word is introduced over the menu Edit Ver@@ complete Ab@@ brevi@@ ation or the key C@@ trl + Alt space key , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large switches are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been found that many changes in one document are written more than once . thus , &amp; Ki@@ le ; the completion for all already written walls .
this mode can be set up in the Settings box ... Ki@@ le Complete . here you can also set the threshold for displaying the completion .
the complete dig@@ its can be installed in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Ki@@ le / complete / fashion / of the personal home folder . mode is for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( dictionary ) or tex .
the Dialog Box visu@@ alizes the insertion of graphics as easy as possible . to view the basics of graphics formats , the sections should be considered and considered .
PS files are not as well @-@ known as PDF files , but provide an excellent basis for changes and re@@ orders of pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
to examine the result of the work , the source code must be compiled . all building tools are group@@ ed in groups in the creation comp@@ iling , converting and creating view .
for the compilation of the source code for viewers such as and ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the other conversion the key individual Alt ; 2 can be used . afterwards , the DVI ; file can be viewed in the standard @-@ like viewer by Alt ; 3 , by Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file can be viewed in a PS file and viewed using Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the quick build command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no integrated viewer is used , a new window will open each time .
a new project is being initiated into the Project New Project .... This includes the following information for the project :
when filling the fil@@ en@@ ame -@@ window the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows exec@@ uting EC@@ MA@@ Script codes . scripts can be managed via scripts in vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be found in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = ki@@ le ) with the following methods :
&amp; latex ; is a rather sophisticated system , in which the basic functions can be expanded by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different aids for supporting users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are supplied with many documents . this includes a documentation for the packages and a further &amp; latex ; reference .
this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a complete manual for the &amp; latex ; commands contained and is thus ideal for searching for a particular format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; ki@@ le ; in three important book@@ marks .
because of the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; it is not always easy to find the right document . as a possible help , &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all zu &amp; Ki@@ le ; delivered documents and for a graphical surface .
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or banners . von &amp; Ki@@ le ; then only the results are displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is a open and user @-@ friendly &amp; latex ; - / tex ; source text editor that can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; box ; is also a part of the Fink project , whereby &amp; Ki@@ le ; also on &amp; Mac ; can be carried out with OS X installed .
many thanks to those who asp@@ ire after the progress of the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project and sacrifice for many hours for the development of tools we all can use under consideration of the &amp; GNU ; -@@ license .

&amp; K@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails ; the signatures process you in the graphical user interface of &amp; k@@ sig ; with the command @-@ line interface , you create random signature or day signatures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides the signatures for external e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signatures , any signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig will be read out . by many signatures with different quotes , styles and information , you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique .
for day signatures the same signature from &amp; k@@ sig &apos;s signature file is read for the whole day . for each day , you use different signatures , as with the random signatures , create unique e @-@ mails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ trl + N File New . this will give you an empty ; empty signature ; in the Sig@@ natures section . in the Sig@@ natures click here . if you have entered your signature , save it with C@@ trl + S File Save or click the Save Disk icon .
you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mail privately or professionally , there are always enough signatures .
to delete a signature , first select it and then remove the Rem@@ ove from the File menu or click the Rem@@ ove icon in the toolbar .
here you can select short commands for menu entries . to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click the Custom Action button and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the button or key combination .
for use of &amp; k@@ sig ; is &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 required . to attach signatures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature text from the output of a command .

version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . all these tools use com@@ man@@ like interface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as base . the combination results in fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
everyone who worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows my name and how outstanding it is . let &apos;s raise it a bit , we give it a graphical interface ! no more dependent on a terminal ; just click the icon for the XML processor and you &apos;re done !
this application wa@@ its for an inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is located in the hard working folder , then you leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the desired folder in the other folder .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted every time my@@ pro@@ c is started .
as already said , anyone who has already worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for it .
if the opened file is inde@@ x.@@ do@@ book then simply select the current job folder . if not , then select up @-@ to @-@ date working folders and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
when it comes to an output on the screen , your file is faulty . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be checked is already selected in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then the current file is simply hoo@@ ked . if not , delete the file with the current file and select the file to be checked by other file - file selection .
if you just want to know if the well @-@ formed file is , click the Well @-@ formed check selection .
to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; by definition UR@@ I ; file selection . both for the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema as well as for the Relax@@ NG evaluation is the definition of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection required .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has also a &amp; X@@ SL processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is already selected , then the current file is simply selected . if not , remove the current file and select the file to be processed using the other file selection .
enter the name of the file , as the result is supposed to have named , and the file will normally be stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , have to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , even possibly little . this makes the plug @-@ in system very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone builds the wished in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; -@@ elements .
to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we start using the Edit menu . this opens the following dialog :
this dialog allows to manage all plug@@ ins included and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug@@ ins without a location , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often , several people work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; support the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift + F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog .
the name and e @-@ mail entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nick@@ name and serves to uniquely identify .
one member may have several roles in the project , such as both team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by looking out the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of your own identity are important in terms of news and comments . see for further information on comments .
in addition to an overview of their team , there is another benefit by capturing members of the team : an event can be generated for information to the team leaders when something is happening . see in for more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something happens in the project . an example would be drawing up and closing the project so that later it can be seen how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is saved , or a script that enters a file into CVS , as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the Side Event configuration of the Shift + F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ sees selected in the recipient list . add@@ res@@ sees can be a team or sub@@ project leader .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
input notes is simple . either the note entry from the editor context menu can be selected or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword can be entered in a comment field followed by ann@@ ot@@ ation text .
notes can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the team member , plays a role in the project from the following options :
nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the other can be found in .
settings can be set up by setting Qu@@ anta ... This dialog extends over several pages that are treated consec@@ u@@ tively .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; concerning tags including code completion can be modified with it . the entries are :
large / lo@@ wer@@ case of tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal case / lo@@ wer@@ case means the tags are inserted in the way they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal upper / lower case , the attributes are inserted in the way they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if checked , for tags that the closing tag is optional , it is inserted immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted .
do not include optional tags : as above for all other tags , with the exception of the simple tags .
automatically update the start and finish tag : if enabled , the corresponding ending tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic replacement of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding encoding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for the detection of different types of files . the default settings can be restored using the Standard button .
default character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting here will be ej@@ ected from the same in the project features if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D has not been detected . however , this setting is em@@ itted from the same in the project features if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates backup copies on a regular basis , so that the document can be recovered from this backup when the program starts or crashes . this is not the same as saving the file .
previ@@ ewing and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in a separate view ( or documentation in a tab ) , making it possible to view the documentation , preview and source text at the same time .
reset the window settings to the default when the next start is useful when the user interface is per@@ v@@ aded by changing M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cking / depen@@ dencies of views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ Layout command line parameter .
the warning message area is used to control the warning of warnings by hooks of no more questions .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as sync behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source code view in shared mode . see the different modes see .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree showing the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document can be adjusted in detail .
in the area of mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the area of structural tree settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the refresh frequency of the tree when editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree should be opened automatically . empty no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are the ones in which no element was found in the current document .
abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each one can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s valid , divided . this means there may be a valid group for PHP in which the i@@ f@@ nd order abbrevi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript .
in this case the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug @-@ ins are the third party &apos;s part @-@ applications , which can be re @-@ used by any part @-@ enabled application , the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be given :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not at a standard location like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
load component in the Read Only mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load . only @-@ L@@ esis @-@ K@@ Parts normally deny loading if this option is not selected .
check the plugin : if this is enabled , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the entered information is correct . then select the entry if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it will be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; beginning version 3.3 , the error search was developed completely new . the support for the no more necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger was set , as well as the support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger . instead a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept was implemented that allows different implement@@ ations via plug @-@ ins .
currently only one plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inserts .
using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plugin in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin select field , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface :
a view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view in which all holding points are listed with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the bottom dock .
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . normally appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
this action is used to connect to de@@ bu@@ gger if necessary , or it tells the plugin to listen to de@@ bu@@ gging claims . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a de@@ bu@@ gger so that normally it does not have to be taken care of .
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ gen session Start the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates listening to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger output view .
tells the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and sending information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it happens before a de@@ bu@@ gger request has started , the script starts with the request .
tells the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution continues . if it happens before a request is made , the execution starts as soon as a request is made .
the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script , where it is possible to clean in functions and include .
assign the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the statement and go to the next as if there were the current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work by Keith Icel@@ ander as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g , which you can find on ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g.@@ s@@ f.@@ net with many more works by Keith .
this chapter describes how you can and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus to adapt to your needs and how to help you get better .
document type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ets ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provide support for market and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they allow &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . their simplicity and flexibility makes &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or &amp; CSS ; s &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two parts , the tag folder and the toolbar . tag folders contain two file types , the tags and descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files with the extension .@@ tag@@ .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see in for details on converting .
this document describes how to create tag XML files , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
tag@@ XML Files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the tag . the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even .
tag folders are nothing but folders . they only contain the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders bear the name of the description language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declared if they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and limits is presented in a simple way .
this is the root element of a tag XML document . it can happen only once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing but one element type above itself .
the type of tag is a script function . when used , &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; is an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only for the class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type method . records the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within that tag can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
this element can only be used once for each attribute . it specifies the name and type of attribute . additionally , it contains additional tags describing how to display this attribute &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element .
specifies the source code used for filling the attributes in the tag editor dialog and the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag group@@ ed together the elements of a list . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is a single element type element .
specifies the position of the attribute text of a tags within a dialog . this tag can occur only once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each one ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( i.e. one for each one ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined . this element is a single element type .
specifies a list of elements that end a tag . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces affect nothing but watch &amp; &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; . this will not cause a break , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog is at the top of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and check tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear , with simple instructions to follow .
this function is currently not yet available . currently , the check only takes place when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the following is an example of a family 1 tag XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following , an example of a working family 2 tag XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ loading function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this tag@@ XML file is to be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ Type = &quot; function &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for doing DT@@ D processing DT@@ D settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = Return 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) No nick@@ name = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) .
an action can be set with settings actions ... to be created . click New action to go to the same dialog :
the keyboard short@@ cut assigned to this action . by clicking on the user defined button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ 1 , the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the defined settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document to the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) , which change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) , are started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even the quick start dialog or the various See in ... actions for ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to find the script at the following places : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file is removed from the document name .
% p@@ id : is replaced with PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text is app@@ ended to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the external script is used .
the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus can be received from the default input . input can be specified in the input field , which is to be sent to the default input .
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only meaningful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the exported application can be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the default output ; error messages , run to the default output . it can be specified , which is to be done with the text written to the default output by setting the value of the selection field output :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group . in the given case , it is not too many , so you can create a toolbar with the name of the mark@@ up .
once a toolbar has been added , you need to add and configure actions . select Options to set actions .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode .
fill in all necessary fields and add the tag to the suitable toolbar .
complete all and , if the tag has attributes and you are planning their use , enable &quot; Edit Tag &quot; dialog when available to enable entry when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is this a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics Other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size .
please note that the created symbol will not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the fact that the day starts , is called , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually seen as loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ alled that clicking this symbol will insert a &amp; lt ; start@@ d ; -@@ tag in the current document .
after creating the symbol it has to be connected with the action . this is done via the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the button and continue with other tags , so there are still some , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; features to the toolbar , or it should be shared to a better overview by some divi@@ ders into several groups . open the toolbar and set Di@@ alogue On Settings Tool@@ bar . make sure the desired toolbar is selected .
after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the toolbar .
for example , I want a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or Pre@@ view . I will select it and add it to the toolbar .
please note how the divi@@ ders support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my toolbar might believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Button is the opposite of the start button .
the new toolbar must be tested by trying out all the symbols to make sure everything works .
after New e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your toolbar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust its &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that its toolbar ( s ) will be loaded when a file is opened by the appropriate type .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how to create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory if anyone has done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first , you need to look for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = your description for these document@@ ations e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 3.@@ html ...
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can see in the &amp; PHP documentation :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = Intro@@ duction , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that there are sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known border for the depth of boxes ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces affect nothing but watch &amp; &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource files will be replaced .
the content section is the area of the doc@@ cr@@ c file that is used to create context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script should display the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( context list ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of context elements that are separated by side @-@ painting ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can simply save your do@@ cr@@ c file to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you specified it in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that these are good and worth dividing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation were used for the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . you won &apos;t be rich , but proud to have collabor@@ ated with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus you are not alone . it is possible to share the failed resource ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or otherwise . at various locations there is an Email @-@ send menu entry like DT@@ D DT@@ D pack@@ et ( D@@ TE@@ P ) sending mail , tool bar toolbar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the Scrip@@ ting tree .
the resources can be uploaded to our main archives , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . the contributions are checked and only made available when our team uses them as correct and useful for publishing . in order to make a good contribution , we recommend to sign the resources for which there is a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of the resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for the later users .
when up@@ loading , you will be asked for your pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for your private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can choose one . in the New Resources dialog , you have to fill out the input fields ( URL preview can remain empty ) and start up@@ loading with clicking OK .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D DT@@ D pack@@ et ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menu , up@@ loading tool bar toolbar , and in the context menu of files and folders in the Tem@@ plate and Scrip@@ ting tree are started .
after downloading a resource , before installation , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and marking . in case of problems it warns and it can then be broken down . if the integrity is given and the resource correctly signed , a message appears stating the source of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages currently not by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; however , the creation can be time @-@ consuming , because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tag@@ XML format . there is a simpler way to automatically convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the menu DT@@ D loading and converting a DT@@ D . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description which should be used . then the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! doc@@ type definition line : the string that appears in ! doc@@ type tag like HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d
fine adjustment of D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after conversion the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand them and to get full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze themselves with these fundamental concepts .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . all that is selected as global is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of administrators to secure various tool operations , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user &apos;s directory , so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a particular project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ o@@ g@@ lows the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the tree view , the flash@@ cards with information and the tool@@ bars .
you can click the tab with the right mouse button to receive a context menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other or all flash@@ backs , re@@ charging , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CVS commands to the current document .
right @-@ clicking in the editor area will lead to a further context menu with regard to the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cutting / copying / paste ) , editing the tag under the mouse cursor or opening the file when the string under the mouse @-@ cursor describes a file .
at the top of the Editor window are the tool bars of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as a standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and associated user requirements .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; insert into your document , then click the icon that represents the tag . now you can insert the data for this just inserted day . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the building views ( Q@@ IT ; ) make it possible to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , to open and to ro@@ am it . in the presentation with box guides are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views .
project Management is a powerful tool called &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view shows all files in the project and allows to manage the files in the project by right click . actions like adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting files from the storage media can be done with the context menu displayed .
another way of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , an entire website , etc .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which context they are used . the category will depend on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; working area . global templates are always available , local templates only available for the appropriate user and templates in projects are available only in the project .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of structuring in Global , Local and Project can also be found here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right clicking on an element , a list of commands will open in relation to the navigation and refresh of the tree .
this tree appears among the other tree views . with it , you can quickly change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the application system aligned with the content allows you to change all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation of web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; Docum@@ entation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be added , edited and viewed on a project @-@ specific documentation .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two tabs at the bottom of the window can be accessed via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab displays all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command . the chocolate page of the toolbar is the option to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a toolbar with email ; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; send the toolbar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; if you receive a toolbar in an email , you can secure and load it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help .
if you have problems starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the PAT@@ H is in front of your bin folder . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE desktop . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; designed for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful features .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a stand @-@ alone , exten@@ sible mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer restricted to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; therefore the appropriate &amp; IDE ; for that purpose .
well , to the above claim must be recorded that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; following , in good application of free software , the idea of Why to develop what already someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; framework , it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly evolved into a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more detailed documentation is provided with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; type , or k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ ler Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , with the oldest entry taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . look into the templates section . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
converts special characters to &amp; HTML when past@@ ing from the clip@@ board , so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions .
converts the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; merge , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful when your &amp; PHP ; script gives error messages !
looks for a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a sort of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre @-@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you can see the display of script actions and de@@ bu@@ gger .
switching and switching the problem repor@@ ter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem repor@@ ter is activated as soon as you change to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
when there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next , depending on the position of the cursor in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that might be there . this allows you to copy graphical files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
upload the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded further input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project is managed . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects you will find the details explained .
loads a project toolbar . these are stored in project @-@ Dir / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool bar . allows you to select the tool bar type : locally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . this only creates the name . actions need to be added by setting actions ... Save tool bars are saved via tool@@ bars toolbar buttons or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar .
removes a toolbar from the field of view . it does not delete it from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the toolbar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team so that the toolbar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an attachment .
enables up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where anyone can access it . see in .
loading a &amp; DT@@ D ; which you or anyone else has done and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be fresh@@ ened up without renew@@ ing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and does not exist in the global K@@ DE folder , the load fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the default ( HTML ; ) toolbar is loaded , in the Tags menu , there is a sub@@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar .
allows access to the current tag settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent insertion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the insertion is denied by tool bar if this tag is contrary to the rules .
in the Plugins menu , the available plug@@ ins are listed under the menu items mentioned above . click on it . click an activated plug @-@ in de@@ activ@@ ates it .
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the Po@@ sters ; -@@ Version .
sel@@ ects the type of line @-@ end identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document based on the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
instant switching between different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching can sometimes need time or create un@@ nice graphics . the card @-@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub @-@ window . selecting an entry will activate the corresponding sub@@ window .
to@@ g@@ gles the status bar display at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window .
the changes in this dialog affects any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
set the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; kate ; see details .
a dialog appears in which you can delete entries from the toolbar or add which you can add and modify the sequences .
this should create help according to the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter , but is not yet implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and free licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled out from top to bottom , because , for example , after completing the project name , the entire directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically . all these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift + F@@ 7 project project properties .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is filled in automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you have the server address of the machine you want to access , except you process local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ g ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) is possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen log will be used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder where templates for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and tool@@ bars by default . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows you to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . you can select multiple files or entire folder .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . in case of server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
let it be checked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be included . if a project is started from scratch , do not hook up .
with this option , all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an exact selection according to good man@@ ure .
this shows a list of the files in the main folder . you can select the files you want by hook or by removing the tick from the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard includes three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project project properties in the menu tree in the sub@@ window profiles or with Shift + F@@ 7 key short@@ cut .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholders ) that are ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to top , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this allows the desired de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set using the Options button .
in the Profile panel profiles , high load profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by cont@@ acting one &apos;s own tree view for each profile .
in the team configuration window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration window , you can turn event actions and add , modify , or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a previously specific event occurs , such as backing up a file .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was open . you cannot influence this behavior right now .
to open another project , select Open Project ... from the Project menu or the Symbol Project open from the toolbar . the dialog project will open and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file is saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders are the same , but the entries are missing and opened with ... in the context menu that can be activated with the right mouse button :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files .
allows removal of the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button is bl@@ ended to prevent the removal .
the password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten by the user . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather un@@ reliable password on the disk save option is not in question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high @-@ loader profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the server name on which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally , this does not need to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port .
depending on your threshold , this is either a time saving feature or a danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it cannot be read easily , but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. by simply changing the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; views can be opened , opened or deleted in the menu &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Project or Project toolbar , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; via Settings tool bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Project toolbar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus to their own way of working .
as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus are best stack@@ ed over the menu toolbar . the addition of tool@@ bars is treated at the bottom of the Add of tool@@ bars section .
the toolbar and the icons can be set either by context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar ) , where new action , a new toolbar can be created . other actions such as tool bar can be removed , toolbar buttons or tool bars can be executed , which can be displayed in the dialog where it can be specified , which actions should be visible on this or other toolbar .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a toolbar , the entries action will also be removed and action processed that are intended to be self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with settings toolbar ... and setting actions can be set .
templates are essentially a document skel@@ eton , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; basically uses templates as a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any directory existing in the system to the template tree .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary is everything that is not pure text . it can be binary except text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc . binary templates are usually found in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) .
documents can be from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . usually , more specialized documents are ne@@ sted in corresponding sub@@ folders . you make a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in the appropriate way to be efficient .
this type of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template , but the same text area should always be inserted in the documents . you can find everything from a comment about a final note up to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl @-@ base . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole websites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
design a document structure as you like ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and save file As template Save as local template ....
once this has occurred , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click on File As template , save selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can simply be dra@@ gged and dropped onto the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used for it , such as drag and drop or insert via the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
in the file tree or in the project file tree view , click on a folder on the right and select site template , enter a name for the template and secure it . by default , it is backed up in the project folder , but of course it can also be saved as a local or global template .
project templates provide a very target @-@ oriented procedure . you can pre@@ define head@@ lines and foot@@ ers , or dynamic with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them with them . additionally , you can keep an eye on some things while using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files filed in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each folder corresponds to one of four types of containers , as explained above .
to specify the behavior of a folder , right @-@ click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a drop @-@ down box with the three types previously described ; files , text or templates . this selection is da@@ zz@@ led once the attributes are brow@@ sed .
this is enabled by default and fits everything except the regular folders in the template overview . if a root folder is set in such a way , it would disable templates in this path , except they would be explicitly activated . in case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you will probably be in a root folder .
allows for pre@@ defined or copied text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project and allows for copying of content templates to a folder with special header lines / foot@@ ers to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a context menu ( show , right mouse button down ) via a complete command collection to add folders or copy and paste templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provides two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source editor , which can be accessed via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cursor appears . then you can edit and rever@@ t to the source code editor where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor at a document containing &amp; PHP ; a small green icon displays the default of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; to edit it , the source text editor is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first one except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source text editor as well as in the V@@ PL ; editor in sync . pressing F@@ 9 this mode is already active , the push of the button moves the active cursor from one window to another , keeping the position in the document .
the synchronization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source code editor is adjustable by setting Qu@@ anta . after choosing V@@ PL ; you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation : a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so tools document properties can be selected . thus editing of invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; editor is possible . the document properties dialog is called as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is created .
met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click into the list allows the change of the content , e.g. keywords on the column names and keyword Key@@ word 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the met@@ a @-@ elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file .
the cursor is like in a word processor , by moving the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cursor beha@@ ves strange . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typing and dropped by button or distance button .
the insertion of tags is done in the same way via the tool@@ bars , as in the source code editor . note that inser@@ ting tags previously does not remove existing identical tags , e.g. when an anchor tag is inserted , surround with text , any other drop anchor tag must be removed .
some tool bars , such as the Wiz@@ ard Wiz@@ ard or the Listen Assistant , are disabled . they will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release tables or lists must be used toolbar buttons .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the analysis of style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and execution of style sheets can be tra@@ cked .
to compile and compile successfully , the lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml libraries needed for a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already exist .
pause in a template , place in a style or x@@ ml file loaded by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g or at the current node . new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db @-@ compatibility mode , orph@@ aned stop points can be set in a specific file and line number and later enabled .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g retri@@ eves the complete path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without path@@ names . file names in the same folder as the top@@ most loaded style file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is , for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l , the following input is possible :
in this command , a partial or complete match with a default named QNAP or a specified model name will be verified . &amp; eg ; template agrees with any QNAP that contains the template template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; will be extended according to the rules specified by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 will be extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a requested stopping point needs to be resolved for the associated UR@@ I and line number . this is automatically done when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . stops are re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each iter@@ ation .

on systems with an installed Re@@ ad@@ line library , you can use the arrow keys to scroll through the trac@@ er memory of the previously executed commands .
multiple commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to pass compound words as an argument . &amp; eg ; with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; as argument is set a holding point in a file called &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; . &quot;

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts while merging .
the program I used showed only the changed lines , but I couldn &apos;t see what had changed within these lines , and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a small night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and paste it in one of the comparison windows .
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
this is useful if two people work independently on one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; when automatically selecting the correct changes . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when merging :
&amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; when merging folders :
&amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and supports the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you need to check code frequently , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tabs are displayed . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left . ( no more trouble if someone alters the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is equal and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means both files differ .
if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can make the typing work easier by writing only the file name of the first file . for example :
ch@@ diff@@ 3 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 folder
opening dialog allows manual typing of fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting an recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the opening dialog tells you your selection and shows it the next time . you don &apos;t need to specify a third file . if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences is done with two files .
through the folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the merge or merge of folders will be initiated . if a file is selected for A , but for B and C a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders .
if merging is enabled , the input field is active for target and can be edited . however , it is not strictly necessary to immediately set an output file . you can do this step later when saving .
the setup button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting to merge / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in Open dialog you do not need to select any files , you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button .
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to figure out how similar these features are , it would be a relatively large effort . you only need to create two corresponding files , they in &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; load them and then compare them . now you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you can &apos;t extract anything from &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; only dropping text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors will interpret and paste text into another program than cut and paste ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible row in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Every info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse for a while above the line . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color Green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these default settings can be changed via the Settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , you can see in the color which file differs . if both files differ , the default color for it is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . this is in the next section ( merging ) good to see .
if differences are found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages , where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( in C / C + + for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare cases . )
the vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line break is activated , the line is dotted with broken lines .
the result window ( below the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Ge@@ ar &#93; when you edited the result . usually it contains text by automatic merging , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the S@@ prin@@ ge button to find the next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ isons are used , each difference is at the same time a conflict that needs to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the row is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . this group will then be the current group .
sometimes by automatic merging or by manual editing , no more line is left in the group ; then in these lines the text &amp; lt ; no line in the queue will be displayed . this is only a plac@@ eholder in the event that you change your mind and perhaps re @-@ insert another source .
the text &amp; lt ; merging conflicts ; however , appears in the clip@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : when selecting the sources the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white characters .
navigate most with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , side down , beginning , end , C@@ trl @-@ Start and C@@ trl @-@ end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs .
in the default window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the In@@ sert key , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as already explained in the Con@@ figuration section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ down / C@@ trl @-@ above ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ picture upward / C@@ trl @-@ above ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict .
to copy the marking to the clip@@ board , you need to press the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ In@@ sert ) . if enabled , whatever you mark will be automatically copied to the clip@@ board and the manual copying is removed . be careful with this option , because you could over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board accidentally .
line ends are saved according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use carriage return + new@@ line \ \ r \ .
the options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically at exit and restored at the next start . ( setup menu settings - &gt; K@@ ID@@ 3 ... )
select a font with a fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
if you activate this option , differences in itali@@ c script will be displayed . if the chosen type@@ face does not support this representation , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors may not be available in their pure form , but would be displayed sc@@ aled . on these systems , the pres@@ ets button automatically adjust@@ s an un@@ just color .
when this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab character is inserted .
if you press Enter or Return , the ind@@ entation of the preceding line will be used automatically for the next line .
when this option is enabled , each selection will be automatically copied to the clip@@ board . then you will not need to copy manually into the clip@@ board .
you can select which new@@ line type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used .
when comparing files , &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; first , find all the completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each row . in this step , white characters are not ignored . even when merging , white characters are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a carriage return character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others save only a new@@ line character &apos; \ &apos; . usually , the carriage return character is made visible , but as a white character is treated . during merging , this option must be disabled .
in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white characters .
this option is disabled in default . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
the option is enabled by default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in the auto @-@ jump mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before jumping to the next un@@ resolved conflict .
( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters are less important in many files . if you only need this from time to time , then use the functions Cho@@ ose A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments .
these options are discussed in the chapter to scan folders and perform a merge operation . see documentation for directory comparison and merge for details .
if a file is saved and already exists an older version , the original version will be app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without any further backup .
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you need &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally via the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
above the encoding fields for coding a short note appears , which is the local coding . ( this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal character . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . as coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different coding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding to use for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they might not work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files might be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands .
turn off this to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting of changes in white characters in text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color @-@ coded over@@ sight column . but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files .
sometimes you would prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . just hide the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the Windows menu . )
sometimes you look at the differences and then decide to merge the files . merge current file into the merge menu even if you compare only two files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as pres@@ et name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command becomes visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor corresponding exactly to your requirements . you can use this function for example to cut disturbing parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command has been specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this command processor . you can write your own pre@@ processor exactly according to your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind this is to allow the user more flexibility in setting up the diff results . however , an external program is required and most users do not want to program this themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l are completely sufficient .
use this command for line reconciliation to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is an erg@@ ulate expression of the text found in a string . the \ \ U converts the found text into upper case letters .
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically add generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ keyword generated text $ . * \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you may start to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for a further pre @-@ processing command for line balance . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing , so quasi deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several re@@ plac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the sub@@ stitu@@ tions from each other . example :
instead you can use something other than per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p .
the data according to the normal pre@@ processor are maintained for displaying and merging . the other operations only change the data that the line balance al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus looks like .
note : in rare cases when using a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ off pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may accidentally fail to notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often program@@ mers have to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively .
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ,
... can simulate co@@ operations and display the simulated changes without actually performing them ,
... perform selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and merging individual files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders are merged , Fol@@ der 1 will be used as the base . if no destination folder is specified , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; Fol@@ der 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not the merge . to start the merge , you need to select the corresponding menu item or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . )
while reading the folder , a small message window will inform you about the current progress . if you cancel the scan of the folder , only the files that have been compared until then will be listed .
when scanning the folder is completed , &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple click of the mouse .
the folder structure is usually folded up . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - , or double @-@ clicking on the object , or by double @-@ clicking the arrow keys for left / right .
if you double @-@ click a file , the file comparison will be started and a comparison window will appear .
the icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be automatically selected . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this kind again .
as shown in the above picture , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns .
for identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered to be the same when their entire content is identical . then folders also have the same color . in folders , the age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , becomes red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , merging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , merging cannot be started .
the synchronization mode is active , if only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action from , so that both folders are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as a visible file name for the output file only B ; directly copied after merging &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are merged and the option New File instead of merge ( uns@@ af@@ e ) is selected , then examines &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and performs the newer file for copying . if the files are different , but the same date then appears an error message : files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors are not fixed , the merging of the folders cannot be started .
when merging , one file is processed after the other . you status column displays finished when merging is successful , and according to other messages when something unexpected occurs . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right .
if in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display more columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , deleted , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or O@@ dner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( including all sub@@ folders ) , you can start merging .
please note : if you do not specify a destination folder , C will be used as a target in the Three @-@ Fol@@ der Mer@@ ge mode , B will be chosen as the destination and A and / or B will be used when synchron@@ izing .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check that all entries that should be in the destination folder will also be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that may be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to only merge the current item , select Run action from the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid merge actions , a message appears that points to the faulty elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog box appears with the Browse , Sim@@ ulate and Canc@@ el options .
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without really making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , a merge window will open ( see the screen@@ shot ) .
when you are finished with a file , choose another folder merge / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved it , a corresponding dialog appears . then &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; continue its work with the next entry .
at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to figure out the cause of the problem . if you continue to merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; you have the option to try another action for the entry or solve the problem in a different way before proceeding to merge .
if some entries have been individually merged , you notice &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and will not merge them at the later compilation of all entries . even if this merge has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered complete .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; ( Set Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files matching the given pattern are displayed in the element tree . multiple patterns can be entered . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( for example * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders corresponding to this pattern are not shown in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders corresponding to this pattern are not shown in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignor@@ es files that would also be ignored by CVS . many self @-@ generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder can be configured with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a hidden attribute . in other file systems , a preceding point sel@@ ects a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is turned on in default .
for links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default .
for links to folders : if the option is switched off , the symbolic links will be compared . if the option is enabled , the links will be treated like normal folders and checked recur@@ sively . ( note that &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; do not refer to possible recur@@ sions . ) This option is disabled in default .
performs a full analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns . ( the number of dissolved , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower if it is applied to files that do not contain text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders over a slow network , it might be faster to compare only the modified date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is disabled in default .
similar to the change date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered to be identical when they are equal . for example , this can be useful when the change date has been lost when copying . please use caution . this option is disabled in default .
enable the synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified . in this mode , the merge suggestions are selected in such a way that both folders are identical . the results of merging files are saved in both folders . this option is disabled in default .
if there are differences , the copy of the newer file will be proposed as action instead of merging . ( this is considered uns@@ af@@ e because it assumes the knowledge that the other file has not been modified too . ) This option is disabled in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version is renamed and maintains the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , it will be deleted without further backup . this also applies to the normal merging of individual files , not only the merging of whole folders . this option is turned on in default .
normally , the folder merge view is visible in the merging of individual files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want this , you can switch off the option directory &amp; text window and switch between the list &amp; text window between the two views .
you can also directly merge a single file , without having to run the folder merge . to do this , use the current file merging from the merge menu . as soon as you save the result , the status will be deleted and the file will not be merged once you launch the folder merge .
however , this status is lost if you re @-@ read the directory : directory menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ ID@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders that are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . you should note a few things :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. contain . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , whit@@ esp@@ ace &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then a file will always be accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change date . therefore , the permission or modification date devi@@ ates from the original . ( note the option Rel@@ ation@@ ship of Size . ) ( This is only possible for local files . )
the main purpose is currently the difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OR . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OR always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OR , press the right mouse button over the difference viewer and then select In K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OR off the contex@@ tual menu .
usually needs &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . if it is used as a part , takes &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; that the input file is a patch file in unified format . then , &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then , &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; the patch program to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created .
when &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports comparing two files , a very small toolbar and menu . merging or comparing files is not supported in the part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now hot comp@@ ars ) exist already . furthermore , the name K@@ ID@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge like the diff@@ 3 program from the Di@@ ff Tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all program@@ mers who have gone this way or get it this way .
you compiled the program from the sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script to K@@ DE . in default , configure is installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines will first be treated as identical , but if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not identical . i@@ F similar lines are next to each other , this is this link often the case .
the editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source text and selecting the A / B / C button . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as text file and it is too much effort to create a separate file format that could store this information .
you can always recover a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c left ; published and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; use already many colors to highlight differences . more emphasis would be conf@@ using and mis@@ ses the purpose . please use another editor for that .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thanks a lot !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .

cut ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift Rem@@ ove ) copies to the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift @-@ In@@ sert ) insert the text from the clip@@ board at the current cursor position or replace the current marker .
show only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , after changes to these options , you need to re @-@ read the folder with the Ref@@ resh function . )
this also causes identical files to be copied to the destination folder when merging . if the target folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after merging . ( the behavior will probably be altered in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default .
note the buttons to select the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the rows from the corresponding window will be app@@ ended to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if the rows are already present ) .
in default this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displays a thumb@@ nail of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the work surfaces , change their size , quit them or shift them . this works both inside a desktop as well as several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and moved even on the desktop and on others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible within a desktop as well as on other working areas .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked on the empty Back@@ ground of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; when cli@@ cked , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize , maximize , On desktop and exit . the commands do the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check@@ box is selected , windows within the &amp; p@@ ager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other working areas .
when this field is enabled , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the names of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed .
tick this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is enabled along with name , the names will be tagged with ord@@ inal numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st desktop .
if this field is checked , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ;
when this field is checked , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty work@@ spaces are displayed to enable their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simple displays simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon displays the windows with their default symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the order of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be defined : classi@@ cally &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid appear , as is known from p@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizontal displays all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizontal line , which is very good for viewing later@@ ally on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be modified in size , view and move windows as symbols or with their contents .

&amp; likes ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended to include new features . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance computers .
if you like , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; shows the enlarged portion of the screen . in the following , this window is called a magni@@ fier window . the image shown in the magni@@ fier window is an enlarged portion of the screen and is referred to as a drop @-@ down window .
in the default setting , &amp; k@@ likes ; the area around the mouse @-@ cursor as a mobile magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you can set a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection window mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse cursor position . please note , that &amp; k@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; mouse cursor .
in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse @-@ cursor into the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button down , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fier window . this also works with the arrow keys .
if you additionally press the &amp; Shift key or press the &amp; M@@ MB , you can move the selection window .
this combination allows you to change the size of the drop @-@ down window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window remains fixed and only the lower right corner can be moved .
&amp; likes ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy it to the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more .
starts or stops the update of the display . stopping the update causes the CPU time needed to go against 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; wa@@ its a mouse @-@ click once the mouse @-@ cursor is per@@ sist for a while in the same place . it is meant to help people suffering from the repeti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which each mouse click em@@ ulate pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain created while clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , the mere desire of the mouse can cause pain . if you suffer from pain associated with your computer , you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet .
to make it clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to avoid pain caused by the mouse click , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click as soon as you briefly inter@@ rupt the movement .
if the intelligent move activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after it has em@@ ulated the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the release of the mouse button . in this way , you can drag the drawing with pressed mouse button . the intelligent move requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click exec@@ utes .
if the intel@@ lect is switched on , the shooting range is active ( 1 / 10 s ) . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button wait before it release the mouse button again , if no moving of the mouse takes place .
if this feature is enabled , a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back brings a double @-@ click . these moves are started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .@@ txt , though &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time it is started , but can be changed later .
if the sound appears delayed , you can help to shor@@ ten the response time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select there Sound System and here the Ri@@ der General . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer that you can set to a lower value to shor@@ ten response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; started at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program there automatically .
if you have already pressed the user button , the settings will be reset to the state after the last press has been pressed .
preferably use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , the intelligent move should be switched off first . if you then get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later accept the intelligent move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in order to decrease with sounds .
first , you should be aware of which places a mouse click stays without effect : clicking on the neutral parts of windows or in places in the browser window that does not link leads to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park the mouse in such places until you want to use them again .
when your mouse clicks , you should clean your mouse . that &apos;s usually pretty simple . the trick here is that you don &apos;t just clean the mouse ball , but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you need to take the mouse ball out . how this happens is different from mouse to mouse . but it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . you can scra@@ pe dirt and dirt easily with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are using the intelligent move in this case , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer end by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use a different window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can execute a mouse click yourself . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and you can continue working as usual .
problem : when you enter text , try and k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and move the cursor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor where you want it . but use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to make a keyboard input . thus , accidental moving of mouse clicks can cause unwanted reactions . safe zones for the mouse cursor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the title lines of windows .
I try to work with intelligent sliding , but I don &apos;t create it for editing text .
the intelligent move is an advanced feature of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is quite possible to mark this way text , copy it to the clip@@ board and then insert any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice on this :
do not use the smart move if you just start with it &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use it . instead , select a mouse click at one end of the text area and keep the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse cursor to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse @-@ click . this will always play when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button push@@ es a sound like a mouse click plays . so you know exactly when when intelligent move the move time starts . later , you can use the intelligent move even without the audi@@ ble mouse click .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window needs to be installed . that should be the case on most system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and these are correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; hold the mouse button as soon as the mouse cursor is blur@@ red . this program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and who are causing pain to the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured in such a way that there is a specific time waiting for a drag action to begin before the mouse button is released . in this way , drag and drop can also be done with the mouse .

&amp; mouth ; is a program with which silent users can let their computers speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; mouth ; silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation course sentences that are to be discussed again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) enter the command that will be used later for the speech output of text . see the description of the setup dialog for more details .
on the second page , select the standard text pass@@ book . you can select often used text passages from the text passages without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) , you determine the dictionary for word completion . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of individual words . additionally , you can synchron@@ ize the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be included in the word version .
the main window of &amp; mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a disk memory of the already spoken phrases ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
if you have your mouth correctly , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is attached to the rate memory . you can choose from these sentences which are to be discussed again .
with the Pre@@ view Pre@@ view menu entry ; set up ... open the &amp; k@@ mouth settings dialog . this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the page word completion and the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page .
in the input field of the language edition , enter the command to call the language generator . in the drop @-@ down box under the input field , you specify the character encoding and the text will be passed on to the voice generator .
&amp; mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed unchanged as standard input to the voice generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command for voice output depends on your voice generator . this command can be found in the documentation of your voice generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
with possibility t@@ ts@@ d will be used as a language service &amp; mouth ; first attempt to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the other settings will be ignored on this page . the dict@@ at@@ d voice service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ äm@@ on , der &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standardized interface for voice output , and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N .
with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the Text passages menu or in the bar for text passages .
the selected text passage is directly referred to in the input field with the selection of Instant Mess@@ ages . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is first entered into the input field .
with the second selection box closing the editing window for text clip@@ board , you can specify whether the text clip@@ board should be saved automatically when closing the editing window .
save the book . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text@@ book will not be saved . select before saving , becomes &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if you want to save the text@@ book script .
the Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ ger page contains a list of dictionary dic@@ tion@@ aries . in the main window next to the input field , &amp; k@@ mouth ; a drop @-@ down box , if this list contains more than one dictionary .
with the buttons to the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field and in the drop @-@ down sel@@ ector .
for this source , select the language you want ; &amp; mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of individual words is simply determined by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the wor@@ d@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; mouth ; ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are summari@@ zed and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option , insert a new , empty dictionary with no entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically insert into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary throughout time .
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are represented as tree structure .
in the lower part , you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage book , you can only change its name .
to add actions such as new text passages or books , or to delete selected text passages and books , you can either click on the selection in the menu bar , toolbar or drop @-@ down menu .
you can change the order of text passages or text passages by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new place or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt + key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected ranges of the disk holder .
the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected ranges of the disk holder .
the currently active set is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected pro@@ positions of the delay buffer .
if this menu entry is enabled , a sliding tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by default , the toolbar is located directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag , the toolbar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is enabled , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is enabled , a sliding bar for text passages with entries is displayed . by default , the bar is placed directly under the toolbar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag , the toolbar can be moved to another location .
probably you have not entered the command for voice output correctly or not completely . open Settings to mouth ; set up ... , open the General Settings page and enter the voice output command on the map tab . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . )
Festival is a language edition system from the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows to use the festival free of charge and without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in / usr / local / festival . the command for voice output is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written voice generator . currently , it only supports English pron@@ unciation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in / usr / local / fre@@ eware . the voice output is then possible with one of the following three command examples :
for the third example , the option must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a voice generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a wave file , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / jihadi@@ sts and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately Ha@@ di@@ fax like to swal@@ low the last character of the text so that an additional character must be added . therefore , the complete command is more complex than in the other examples :
/ usr / local / usr / local / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA -@@ e / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA -@@ e / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA -@@ e / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA -@@ e / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA -@@ e / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 - / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written to a line . the option to send data as a default input must be enabled .
the voice output dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further voice service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
since the setting of the language generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you just have to use the t@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; mouth ; set .
to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in &amp; mouth ; when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to make use of mouth , you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additional memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends in detail on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; mouth ; is an application with which people who cannot speak can output text through the computer . a list of already spoken phrases is stored , which the user can always re @-@ write .
note that &amp; mouth ; no voice syn@@ thesizer . on the computer a voice syn@@ thesizer must be installed .

&amp; k@@ de ; - the voice @-@ over@@ s system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a service consisting of modules that allows any application to read text about the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; program@@ mers ready to use their applications with T@@ TS abilities .
read text ( or parts of it ) in the text editor &amp; kate ; even if &amp; kate ; embedded in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications .
speech is distributed via the program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher , which uses different background programs such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc .
allows to generate voice output on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; utility program .
in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Met@@ a @-@ language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the &amp; k@@ de voice output service ; an application without visible windows that offers T@@ TS services via &amp; d@@ bus ;
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configur@@ ing and setting t@@ ts@@ d over t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for web browser and kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor and kate ; with which a text file can be read in whole or in part .
in addition to the bu@@ g@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) , you will find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ts ; in the k@@ de @-@ channel mailing list . you can also subscribe to the list via ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ r .
before you can use it , you need to install program speech @-@ speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ chers and set it correctly .
at the first start of kt@@ ach@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the flash@@ card speaker is displayed . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the flash@@ card general is displayed .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female ones , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up multiple variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up a speaker before you start &amp; down ; use as the program speed disp@@ at@@ chers otherwise use the standard speaker .
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printer sp@@ ans for the same printer .
if you click on the card tabs Spo@@ kes@@ man in kt@@ es@@ m@@ gr , the card holder will be displayed . this will also appear automatically when you start dict@@ at@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up yet .
all speakers already set up appear in this list . the preferred speakers will appear on the top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if an application does not provide a speaker .
with a click of the mouse , select a speaker from the list , and click this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a click of a mouse , select a speaker from the list , and click this button to change the settings . see below .
with a click of a mouse , select a speaker from the list , and click this button to move the speaker in the list one line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; down ; system .
select a type of voice here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boy and girl &apos;s voice to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the speaker card speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can already use it . go back to the General tab and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) enabled , so that the T@@ TS service of &amp; k@@ de ; starts . see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to create and manage text orders .
if you have set up at least one speaker , you can start the &amp; k@@ de language dispens@@ ing system ; click on the General tab General to open this tab . here you can set some general options .
this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the map file orders will be displayed , and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the marking , will stop K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated .
if the t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is terminated , it will start &amp; down ; if the Voice output field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled .
if this check@@ box is selected and kt@@ ach@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the control bar &apos;s system area , it disappears again as soon as the reading is complete .
with the buttons in this row you can start , stop , pause and resume text jobs .
with the buttons in this row you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board , or open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for an order .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be taken over all pages .
the flash@@ card orders are only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the General tab General and check the voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . first check , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then select the text that should be read and select text output from the main menu . after a short time , the speech output should begin .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can skip this step also , but then many &amp; HTML ; he@@ aders and other invisible brands are also read .
in &amp; Po@@ sters ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the displayed text . first check , if &amp; kt@@ d ; runs . then select the text that should be read and select text output from the main menu . then the speech output should start .
this also works if &amp; Po@@ sters ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ not@@ fy is the &amp; k@@ de news system ; which noti@@ fies you about events that you have set up . you can also read the text of these messages from &amp; down .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different types of messages . for example , set up so that you are notified when a message appears in an IR@@ C channel where your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ d , you can then read the IR@@ C message text .
if a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry will appear in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application .
the k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml file , which is part of the delivery of &amp; dict@@ ts , is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , since it can be assumed in most cases as presum@@ ed .
filters are one of the advanced features of &amp; kt@@ d ; . for normal work with &amp; dict@@ ts ; filters are not required .
in filters , text is processed before being sent to the program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation , to replace wrong spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker or to b@@ ypass certain defici@@ encies of speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand how filters work , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text .
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read @-@ out , the retained contracts are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be continued after the output of the warning .
messages have the next highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; have a long text read on a website , you can go with &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also news . read about it .
the rest are simple text orders . every job you send from the card list is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of an application that uses text orders . text orders are meant for the output of longer texts that do not possess any particular ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queue , except for the output of screen re@@ aders . when an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; down ; just one such reading , this output is stopped and terminated .
first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen re@@ a@@ ers . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as to &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filter the text and pass it to the next filter . at present there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can be even further types of filters .
character Dic@@ tion@@ ers replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . it is supplied with pre@@ defined string translation filters that allow the creation of chat emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for format@@ ting messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better comprehensible form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Converter is using an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert from one format to another format . in the scope of delivery , some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
with language selection filters you can send jobs depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . for example , if you have set a female voice on the card holder , you can read the text from K@@ DE messages about it .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules , by which it is applied to voice output . if the filter detects that its rules do not apply , it will continue to pass the text to the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it will be processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the page below . processing by the filters takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the established normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed in series to the top down@@ wards .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and the following setup di@@ alogs are displayed below .
you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns for setting up character sets . if these patterns are found in the text , the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it only has to be distinguished from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the first column . the list is processed in the order from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
these buttons allow you to load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . if you load a list from a file , the entries from the file will be app@@ ended to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter will only be used if the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages registered here . click the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ trl key at the click of the mouse .
if a value is entered here , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID of running programs is provided with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example , the application ID copy @-@ 34@@ 32 shows , you may only enter copied .
the string input filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Sli@@ de filter if match . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
in comparison of words , the string translation filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . so the words must be limited on both sides by the separ@@ ator character .
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . but if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package c@@ alle .
X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such transform@@ ations . it can only be applied to well formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility needs to be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c User Language program . x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached by setting the PAT@@ H environment variable also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
with the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection filter , you can send text to a specific speaker , set up on the card holder , or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that texts by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice .
the speaker is selected based on the speaker properties which the program gives , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the properties of the speakers created on the card holder . with the speaker selection filter , you can over@@ ride the selected speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; editor and # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can click on the button to get help when entering .
to achieve faster processing , try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the properties of the speaker you want . if the text fulfil@@ ls the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected , which meets the requirements best . click on the button on the right to see the language selection dialog .
use these buttons to save or load your speaker settings or delete all settings .
the speaker selection filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Sli@@ de filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice output API , from &amp; k@@ de ; allowing program@@ mers to add T@@ TS capabilities to their applications . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD over &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD Module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can use .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the voice output API of &amp; k@@ de ; see the full documentation for both AP@@ Is on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice output services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program t@@ ts@@ d to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
text of the text for reading and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are more commands you can use . for a list of all commands you give
open two &amp; kon@@ sole ; -@@ windows . first start kt@@ d in one window , then t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; form@@ er@@ filter , but when using the module for festival , web pages are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able works at all . you must do this yourself if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found through the environment variable PAT@@ H .
certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation signs appear to cause errors in the syn@@ thesizer , so that whole pro@@ positions are ski@@ pped or only Kau@@ der @-@ wel@@ sh is issued . what can I do about it ?
make sure that the sign encoding option is set to the right value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be fixed by a string release filter .

K@@ T@@ TS works with any voice syn@@ thesizer that can be started on the command line in a &amp; console .
the list of languages mentioned above may be incomplete or out@@ dated . hence , consult the description of the syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ts ; , for information not yet contained in this manual .
the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand &amp; dict@@ ate to use another syn@@ thesizer , contact the developer team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to compile and compile , you need a current development environment from K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) , including the packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; program .
if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; retri@@ eved from the source code archive for cad@@ view@@ - or downloaded the tar@@ ball that you have created every night , compile and install the program using the following commands :
before you start , make sure the speech syn@@ thesizer works properly with your speech syn@@ thesizer . you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; k@@ de ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of the speech given by the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . the t@@ t@@ ms@@ gr utility is to be developed in such a way that the setup of speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ chers is possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer required .
a long text is de@@ composed into individual sentences . the user can leave set or paragraph mode , repeat , pause or cancel the output .
for example , if you have a speaker whose language is English and whose gender is female , it will be used , otherwise the best matching speaker will be chosen . if you want to learn more about it , just look at it .
if you click Add a Spo@@ kes@@ person on Add to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the tab card speaker setup will appear . as an example , the setup of the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below . for details on the modules , please refer to .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in PAT@@ H , you only have to enter the festival .
select the text encoding for text delivered to festival . if voices are known , the setting is automatically done . in general , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , you adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some controllers and display them gray , the voice you choose will not allow these settings to be displayed .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need several seconds to load due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that the first set will be syn@@ thes@@ ized faster ( with larger memory consumption ) .
if this check box cannot be selected , you haven &apos;t set up a speaker yet ( or click on the user to click ) .
if this check@@ box is selected , the program window will be displayed at the start of kt@@ es@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after startup , only the t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr utility is visible , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window .
if this check@@ box is selected and kt@@ ach@@ m@@ gr runs not yet , it will appear in the system area once K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to pause or otherwise control the reading .
here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application setting the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently processed sentence . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID of the ID on the card holder .
with the buttons in this row you can proceed or go back in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK , all changes of the settings ( also on the other flash@@ cards ) will be taken over and kt@@ ach@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to see the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ d , click on the audio card audio . see also .
here , only text orders are listed and managed . editions of screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . for more information on the types of news from &amp; down , please refer to .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ t ; either compiled without support for the respective audio module , or kt@@ ops ; can &apos;t load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the speaker speed here . 50 free ; % corresponds to approximately half and 200 . % approximately the double normal speaking speed . in order for these settings to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click Apply to take over the new settings for the running and t@@ t ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you will need to figure out which device works with you . in case of doubt , select Def@@ ault .
on this tab card you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a higher priority message .
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . after the edition of the screen reader has been read , the retained assignments are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next higher priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will resume after reading the warning .
messages have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that sends messages . if you want to read a long text on a website , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless welcome someone who just walks the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , the audio output will be added to the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both the introduc@@ tory sound and the introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card are only valid for normal text orders . there are no special actions for messages , warnings and editions of screen readers if they are interrupted by a higher priority message .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; read K@@ not@@ fy messages , start kt@@ es@@ m@@ gr and click Noti@@ fications . the card card al@@ erts appears .
check this check box to disable &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activate noti@@ fications . if this setting is not selected , the other settings are de@@ activated and &amp; kt@@ d ; don &apos;t read al@@ erts .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications with which a sound is played will not be read .
use these buttons to add or delete events from the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears in which you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone in an IR@@ C message men@@ tions your nick@@ name .
all events specified in the list are ignored .
use this sel@@ ector to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; to do when an event occurs . you have the following choices :
if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter here the properties of the desired speaker . standard sel@@ ects the speaker shown in the list on the card holder as the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a specific application , it is executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application .
the event All Noti@@ fications for the Application Standard ( all other events may not be deleted from the list . for this , you can set the pre @-@ read al@@ erts as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications in a file . use the Load button to load stored settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except All Noti@@ ce will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains brands for controlling voices , speech speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . also brands for controlling the pron@@ unciation of e.g. abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently supported and supported ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following limitations are available :
you need to install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) since it is the default voice that uses the festival in the output of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or ton@@ ality in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100 % , the SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and by@@ laws detection filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . thus , the first set can be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the entire text order . this allows you to skip or pause jobs on the map tab , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not directly support it .
here you see the Stat@@ utes recognition filter . at the first start of &amp; down ; as default , a set level recognition filter is automatically set up . you can change its settings or add more sentence detection filters , but beginners will be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
the easiest way to learn is to set up the speaker selection by trying out . turn on the speaker selection and enter text to read . check the list of speakers , which speaker &amp; kt@@ ts ; switch on the speaker selection again , change some properties and check how the speaker selection changes . you must of course have more than one speaker installed , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; then can start faster with the first set , since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function , you can pause or ab@@ ort orders on the card holder .
for these reasons , the normal set identi@@ fier filter is automatically set up if you start dict@@ at@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything in this filter unless you know what you are doing .
a pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter comparing text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and inser@@ ting a tab character ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) at the by@@ laws ( tab characters are automatically removed from the text prior to the filter ) .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages ( c@@ mp ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen re@@ a@@ ers .
if you have removed from see the normal code recognition filter , you can insert it again by up@@ loading the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c contained in &amp; down .
on the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection tab , you can over@@ ride the speaker settings for the application .
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the card holder ) . in other words : no speaker properties are specified .
use the most appropriate speaker , which has all the features of a built @-@ in speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; ctu@@ ts ; otherwise select &amp; ctu@@ ts ; the speaker that best matches the originally set properties .
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select here the properties of the desired speaker . if this feature does not matter , enter nothing .
mark this check box if the property should have preced@@ ence over other features . you can also set multiple markers here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as the priority feature . you will rarely use this feature . the only case you may want to specify the language attribute is when you know that a particular application will be sent text in another language than the one set in the working environment .
to use all the properties in the field spokes@@ man , which is most likely to delete the following , click the default speaker on the selection button and then use the speaker that is closest to the following .
in this case , 0 stands for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify a job number . ( without order number the input is 0 ) .
t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr crashes when it is started . I compiled de@@ bug support , but I don &apos;t get back tracking .

the audio output about AL@@ SA does not work if I play music at the same time with another application . if I stop a text order , it freezes &amp; down ; a . on the &amp; console ; a message appears that says : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
on your system there is the problem that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA , which prevent the simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . you can find hints for possible solutions on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I have uploaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ es@@ m@@ gr doesn &apos;t display this voice .
in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ es@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ ue / vocals , add the new voice . as a guide , you can use the other entries . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice , to the developer .
on the audio card audio , there is a setting speed . for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and search@@ able via the PAT@@ H environment variable . some syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ modules like Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed even on the map tab for speaker setup . depending on the selected voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the speaking speed settings are ignored when &amp; down ; &amp; HTML ; reads . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) disable either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML Converter , and set up the speaking speed .
I don &apos;t make it that websites are read with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; dict@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice .

I have added a custom character set filter and now I can go in &amp; down ; no more to proceed or go back . on the tab order it is displayed , the order consists only of one set . what am I doing wrong ?
pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( dot , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) must not be filtered . instead use a filter for the number of pun@@ ctu@@ ation for these characters .

before you start , make sure your voice syn@@ thesizer works properly . follow the instructions that you received with the syn@@ thesizer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported .
you need to install at least one language . help can be found in the instructions supplied with festival . if you want to read websites , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on .
this voice requires Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or newer . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / li@@ b / vocals / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you must enter for the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , search the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech language , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic like ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then festival takes over the le@@ xi@@ kal@@ ische analytical and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; not a complete language output system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from phone files . you need additional software to create this phone . Festival generates this from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also generate from German texts Di@@ ophone . more information can be found under .
in this procedure , additional wra@@ pper code is added to Festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices to voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folders but in the festival / li@@ b / . manuals can be found at :

Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , source language syn@@ thesizer written in &amp; Java , i.e. you must install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; you can adjust neither pitch , volume nor speaking speed .
the command module allows you to use &amp; t@@ ts ; with any voice syn@@ thesizer located in a console ; it can be controlled on the command line .
it is best to use a command that writes the voice output into a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device
this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allowing management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings through a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be inv@@ oked by selecting K Menu _ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module will be displayed in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the network settings module ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ; started .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware is not able to install . physical devices and their drivers must be installed and configured already , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .com ; the device at all indicates and allows setting of network features .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed when installing and installing Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files , according to the kernel version :
the network settings module will be loaded when the network settings option in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when the module &apos;s network settings are started , this will automatically detect the platform used on the system .
if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is possible to select the platform from the list that best matches the distribution and release date . by selecting the setting Not @-@ again , the definition can be made permanently . at the next start of the network settings , this selection is automatically pres@@ et .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are gray , which means that the settings can only be considered , changing is not possible . in the system management mode , you enter system management mode at the right lower end of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three tabs :
the Network Interface Manager is used to manage network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the network interfaces :
the settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button ... Set@@ ting up in the dialog device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options .
with the option Automati@@ cally , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system are performed simultaneously with the start of the system services . the DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all the necessary TCP / IP information at every system start , therefore no further setting is required . in the selective list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server can be selected according to the system .
with the option Man@@ ually the TCP / IP configuration can be done without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address needs to be specified . in the input field network mask the sub@@ net mask must be set .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if initi@@ alization is un@@ desirable , this option should not be enabled .
the values entered in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address on the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or disabled as needed . switching on an out@@ dated network device is activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or disabled as needed . disable an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on Interface ...
specifies the host &apos;s IP address on the local sub@@ net , which communic@@ ates the physical link to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communications with hosts in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located .
a computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers only request IP addresses . if the machine requests ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS resol@@ ves this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution calcul@@ ator part of the name resolution allows simple management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed .@@ DNS entries can be sorted by selecting an entry and listing or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list using the Hin@@ der or Her@@ under buttons .
by clicking the Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will display the New Name Server dialog .
first , enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be added to the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... it will display the Edit dialog .
the list named in particular describes host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used when bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , remote networks it can replace DNS servers .
usually the list contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and support some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this still in the test version of IP is to replace version 4 in future .
enter the IP address of the known machine and click Add ... Add the New Ali@@ as dialog will be displayed .
enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button . if the known computer has several alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a particular known computer from the list and select Edit .... The Modi@@ fied Calcul@@ ator will be displayed .
it can be done one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the network settings are not effective immediately in the system . to enable the changes , the following command needs to be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) it is sufficient if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution can be used .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is not sufficient ; in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and other things .
this is recommended only to experienced users , but it is not difficult to compile and compile . the following commands should do so .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic networking technology will be given , and in the second section all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf will be discussed ; variable configuration files will be discussed .
this section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is provided .
IP networks are currently being run using TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 6 never found widespread dis@@ semination . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . this description is currently focused on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is . in third @-@ party networks , on &amp; eg ; Work@@ place , the network administrator is the contact point that addresses a valid IP address or if available , DH@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address cannot be simply chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , therefore any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateway .
for smaller networks , addresses are usually used in the range 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
additionally , the net@@ mask is set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ bridge ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own computer ) . the default route is required for IP forwarding .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to a so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
in this part , the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf are affected and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections , so it won &apos;t be surprised if there is a different content than specified in the case of active DSL links .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ fig . another stand as expected can therefore occur .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar , which furthermore offered the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective un@@ packing .
before a band can be used it has to be mounted from &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; c@@ ots the tape back and reads the pre@@ st@@ ressing information of the tape . recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; don &apos;t recognize the for@@ eplay on the tape , you will be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted .
recognizes and k@@ dat ; the credits , it searches for the appropriate index on your disk . if this cannot be found , you will be asked if the band index is to be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the icon for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the volume of the tape can now be searched by tabs of the entry for the tape .
before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; by changing the symbol for the tape to recognize that the integration for the tape has been released and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
before a band can be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; it must be format@@ ted .
a band type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; this process does not correspond to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; this does happen before you can be format@@ ted by the tape of &amp; k@@ dat ; flo@@ ppy disk drives usually require a format@@ ting of the tape , but DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the tape name and capacity , &amp; k@@ dat ; with the format of the tape fort . all data on the tape is lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is integrated automatically and is ready for use .
before you set up the backup process , you must select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only backup this file or folder .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a check . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be saved .
ri@@ ght@@ click the local file tree and select in the Save Menu ...
once the backup has been started , the dialog opens for backup . in this dialog you can check the selected files once more and change the backup settings .
if you have confirmed the settings , the backup appears . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including data rate and time remaining .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a check box . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
right @-@ click on any of the archives and select the menu item Check ....
once the scan process has been started , the dialog appears for checking . in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for the check .
if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the test process and the data throughput and the time remaining .
before you can restore the restore , the files that you want to restore must be selected . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive entry . it will only restore the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a check box . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be recovered .
ri@@ ght@@ click a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore ...
once the restore process has been started , the dialog will pop up . in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the job folder for recovery .
if you have confirmed the restoration settings , the dialog will pop up . this dialog displays the progress of the restore process and the data throughput and the time remaining .
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re @-@ create the band index file based on the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the band :
this creates a security profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current job folder where the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured will be automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder .
for all folders that are listed in backup files , only the files in it are backed up to the same file system as the folder . folders that are on other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be entered separately in backup files . each entry is considered by tar independently of the others .
to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of creation of this documentation .
you can set the settings through the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding variant of the tape .
this setting is active , transm@@ its , and k@@ dat ; before the tape is inserted , the command inhi@@ bits load to the drive . in some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; to block the ej@@ ection of the tape drive . this setting may not work with all tape drives .
if the option is enabled , the release of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically ej@@ ected the band . do not use this option with Flo@@ ppy @-@ Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is enabled , it will try to change the hardware side block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you must inform &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case you will need to tell the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows :
the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time in which the tape has been format@@ ted .
the band id is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the rest of the files on the tape are bare nec@@ tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the content of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is included .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who don &apos;t know where you can get information about your system or where the system supports various protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users quick access for example on information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access , for example , to information about problems that occur on their server . therefore , try to provide some advanced features that can be used to filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and will be explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; features for filtering and sorting the single protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after startup , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first , the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - is not displayed to you , and it opens itself instead of a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very probably not with system administrator privileges . the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the / var / log , for which normal users usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion or after entered strings . the list of the protocol lines is now automatically changed , so that only the protocol lines will be displayed that match the selected filter . in the default setting , a protocol line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns .
you can also select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term will then only be matched to the entries in the corresponding column . for example , in the protocol file system log , select the process column , and also enter the name of a process in the filter bar , so show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all the protocol lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . level errors are displayed with a more con@@ spic@@ uous color than the minutes lines of the level hint .
if you just want to display a specific process ( for example in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . for example , this can be useful if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as for example to start the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , you can use filter bar .
in addition , you can use the Add to new line option in the main window context menu to view all new incoming protocol lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; enables the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log to display in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. You can find more up @-@ to @-@ date information on the supply sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; you can also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and named as named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
the system V In@@ it quickly becomes the standard for controlling the program start when bo@@ oting the system in the &amp; Linux world . this is because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it .
I will not go into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc This is important because maybe someone could try to convert a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and reform@@ at@@ ting . the &amp; Linux ; kernel looks first under / etc after an in@@ it file . therefore , you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the sy@@ s@@ V in@@ it differs also from the BSD in@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is r@@ c.@@ d. d@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following other folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for every system service that you want to boot when bo@@ oting the system or when switching to another run@@ level . system services include such things as set@@ serial , which will only be started once . such calls are r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file even if there is not much use for it . you can also set up a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port when you boot up .
the kernel searches in different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one finds .
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following in the initial area :
at this point , you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have mess@@ ed up something then you can fix it by re@@ boot the system and run the following :
but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d then you &apos;ll probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no proper files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how does it start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument such as start and stop . you can actually start these scripts manually on the command line :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script is called stop using the argument . if it contains an S , the script will be inv@@ oked with the start argument .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server run@@ level that only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; run . in addition , I could also have a user run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult , because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six Run@@ time to start ( or stop it ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ stit@@ n or change the position within a level by removing it somewhere else . this will only remove the entry from its original run@@ level ( or its position ) . this will not happen only if they extract an entry from the area of available system services .
note : entries are moved if you drag them to a new area . to merely copy them to a new Run@@ time level , you must explicitly copy from the Edit menu or from the contex@@ tual menu and paste it into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try to insert the system service again .
note : there is currently no way to restore entries that were thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the Tab key to activate the different fields of work ( available system services , Run@@ time 1 Start , Run@@ time 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to move an entry to another run@@ level , move it with cut into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ trl + V ) .
to change the sorting number or name of an entry manually , press the Enter key to open the Properties dialog . use the Tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pre @-@ settings are recovered to the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
I experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ level@@ ing , and now the machine is rest@@ art@@ ing constantly . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; to run under run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) , you will need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please refer to the distribution manual for details .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary set @-@ up programs of these distri@@ butions but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using another distribution : please check that all the configuration files are required by the respective system service ( and whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply end up without notice if their configuration files are not present or in@@ correctly set up .
the meaning of &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ time varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use a different distribution , please send me information about the run@@ time to be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter custom@@ ization of &amp; k@@ user ; .
once you have made changes , you need to save it . you can either use the toolbar icon or the Save In the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two flash@@ cards , user and user group list . to edit , select the user or the desired group by double @-@ clicking on the entry .
some flash@@ cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only when you have enabled space limitations ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card card will be created on which you can make individual settings . other flash@@ cards appear if Shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed in BSD UNIX .
the tab card password management appears if Shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD uni@@ xes .
this card only appears if for at least one embedded fil@@ esystem space limitation ( quot@@ a ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the file quot@@ a user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) .
these parameters can be individually set for each file system . the current file system is selected by means of the field fil@@ esystem with space limitation
the Groups tab informs about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the default group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Pri@@ mary Group field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field .
the dialog properties of the group includes a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the user or group or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or the selected group works an@@ alog@@ ously .
this module allows you to install the li@@ lo boot manager , add , remove and modify the boot password , change the time to boot the default operating system , add , remove , modify , modify , delete , modify , and more .
