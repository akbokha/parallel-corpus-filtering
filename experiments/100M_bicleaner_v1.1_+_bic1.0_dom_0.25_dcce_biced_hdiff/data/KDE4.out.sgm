<seg id="1">You can translate the module website into the & konqueror; translate the menu under Extras website. select the source and target language of the translation from the drop-down list.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated into place of the entire & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation is only very rudimentary. in the best case, babelfish produces a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, translations are not subject to important decisions, without verifying the translation beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages can be translated. other texts should be translated by yourself on the Babelfish page, where you can insert translated texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">Package & package; contains various modules for and konqueror; despite its small size, they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of & konqueror; by making these easier to access.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information on the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual of & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror; select Settings extensions.... Open the box card tools and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of default setting modules from the kde; addons package. please note that possibly more modules are on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, the & konqueror; it contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click in & konqueror; on Tools crashes. then you can view the page, the & konqueror; to crash, or delete the list of crashes, if present.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module Invisible filter (also called folder filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras address filter. with the module you can filter and konqueror; 's current directory of work in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror; to use, select Tools DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed page. as default, the display starts with the root node of the document, for example: documents.com, all other nodes are sub-elements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides another view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory for local files. it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The feature of & FSView; consists of mapping waxed folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called tree map. tree-Maps allow representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose area is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the child's subordinate objects is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">For & FSView, the size of a file or folder shows the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files, even then easily detected, can be easily detected if they are far below in the folder hierarchy. accordingly, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of & UNIX; -command can be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView, an entry in the Treemap is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation use the rectangles useful color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched over view color mode, can be either depth for easy recognition of the nesting depth or the representation of another file feature such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labelled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property, you can specify whether there is enough space to display, or whether the area of subclass rectangles is to be used. furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the caption in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">For Treemaps the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. in the Treemap in & FSView, this target is not always complied with. it is drawn frame to indicate the nesting of the entries, and this frame will need space, which is then lost to the subordinate entries.</seg>
<seg id="20">How to partition the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. in this case, it is always advantageous for the labeling and avoidance of space loss by frame to create rectangles that are as square as possible. the best methods in this respect are rows, columns or recurrent sectioning.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can set the minimum displayed area for an entry above the menu entry View Anstop on area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent item in order to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally, & FSView was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widget designed for the application of KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The picture gallery can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras picture gallery... or with Ctrl + I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the gallery picture gallery, a dialog opens with which you can set the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field.</seg>
<seg id="26">The option images per line has a slider and a turntable to set the number of thumbnails in each line in the gallery.</seg>

<seg id="32">To include the subfolder with the check box, you can set the subfolders to which level the subfolders are included.</seg>
<seg id="33">Copy the original images to the gallery to see if the original images are to be copied to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">Using the comment file checkbox, you can specify a comment file for captioning the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box selector color depth, you can set a different color depth for the thumbnails than in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; -settings gives you easy access to general & HTML; -settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; -settings can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras HTML settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">The media playback for the navigation pane can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Windows Navigation Pane or with Keyboard Shortcuts F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click on the & konqueror's navigation area, and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Browser Detection adds a menu entry in & konqueror; in addition to which you can change browser and operating system recognition for individual domains. this is helpful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The default browser recognition of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a web page that refuses to access this browser, change browser recognition in one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the password in MSIE for sites that decline access with browsers on the base of Mozilla. for example, you need the MSIE browser recognition to call up with the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not correspond to the W3C standard or use their own & HTML; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identification of this outdated browser.</seg>
<seg id="44">With this option, the set-up browser recognition is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing.</seg>
<seg id="45">With the menu entry... you can set the scope of the information on the browser used and the operating system in the individual.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library gPhoto2. of course, each medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digicam; includes fast image editing with basic image editing tools. you can use them to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. the editing capabilities can be easily extended with KDE Image Create Interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digicam; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional skills. it works complete in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion by libraw, DNG export and ICC color management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with significantly more metadata, such as & eg; about the camera or the lens to be searched for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs is also digitized; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of end users. therefore, they should report trouble and improvement opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="60">Whenever you are in the program, your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system. if you use these links, your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system. all the information you need is entered here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digicam; is a project that is supported by a community. that is, the user and developer can help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam, we would like to encourage you to answer questions other users of & digikam. in this mailing list, however, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful in this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digicam; homepage to visit news about shared versions and other information about & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to join & digikam; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for signing in the developer mailing list of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you first start, you will be asked where to save your images and your database. you can specify a local, remote or removable folder. simply enter the path name or click the Folder icon Folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field, you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data extraction is stored. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & digicam; will additionally be used as an Albenbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a collection of images on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder that contains images as the base folder. & digicam; view any subfolder as an album. no image will be modified.</seg>
<seg id="68">& digikam; durst recursively reitalizes the library path in its entire depth. you cannot exclude any subfolders, unless it is in hidden folder. you can do this by adding a point before the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenliste do not have any photos as symbols. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon. this will then be used as an album icon. for more details, see the Album section.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can be in & digicam; set up your digital camera. then you should learn how to use My Albums and My Criteria to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, it's possible to handle it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the help of RohkameraBackup.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh-DecoderSettings and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library gPhoto2. of course, each medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera then appears as a disk drive. the camera then appears as a disk drive. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may also use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">GPhoto2 is a free, distributed software collection for digital cameras, which supports an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transfers over the serial port are slow, this connection is now obsolete. & digicam; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support to reliably read the thumbnails by digiKam. if the exif support is not available in libgphoto2, thumbnails may not be seen or the creation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things on & digicam; is how easy it is to expand its functionality by modulating modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digikam;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphic programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as a user can. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digikam; by writing a small module to complete a function when the changes in & digikam; themselves perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either strip the sidebars with & LMB, or switch to full screen mode with F11 respectively Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drawing and dropping pictures works everywhere: you can place an image in another part of the Albenbaums, above the horizontal dividing line or into another application window. the only limitation is that an image cannot be stored in keywords, data list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. thus, filtering on the filename only works if this is displayed in the symbol view. which fields can be displayed in the dialog of the AlbenSetup.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My Albenlipiquot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos stored by & digikam are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard disk, by the name of their collection in the Albenthic properties or after the date on which the album was first created.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have created a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. you can also scan an album Importieren images. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it. in the then appearing menu, you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all photos and move them to the destination album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album properties, right click on the album and select the album Properties contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection set by you will be used to sort your photos by selecting the collection from the toolbar or view albums by collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do so in the collections for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The Album- Date: used when you sort your albums by date with View Album sorting by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The oldest, average, nests: these set the date to the oldest, the newest picture or that of the average section of the album. to do this, first attempt to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, instead, the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first record an album in & digikam, the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlipiquot; this should help you to remember the photos on the album. sometimes the first photo on the album is not representative and you may then choose another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as Album icon, click the image with the right mouse button and select in the context menu & quot; As an album preview, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in a collection and collections can't be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digicam; support the input of keywords for single photos in the section My keyword list at the bottom of the main window. album collections have a different effect. to the collection are always all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window will provide you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all the images in this album will be displayed in the image window. each photo will be displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of these thumbnails with the two loupe buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you have to wait a while while the thumbnails are generated. you can avoid this by using all thumbnails in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information on each image is displayed below the respective thumbnail. what information this is, you can change settings by editing. select the albums page here and customize the thumbnail area to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear. if you leave the mouse cursor over a picture for a moment, the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo. the screenshot at the top of the introduction to the main window displays such help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all about digikam. albums and keywords allows you to organize your pictures as you like. image editing shows your photos and allows you to perform a number of improvements on them. you can view all the functions that are made with & digicam; you can choose between viewing the images, a slide show or editing the images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by selecting either F4 image processing... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing.... in the Edit pane; image editing you will find a guide on how to edit your photos. with image processing, you can view your photos and change them.</seg>
<seg id="102">It may happen that & digikam; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by using the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the submenu of Open. for this, and how to adjust it to your needs, if your program is not listed, you will find information in & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after processing other image editing programs, problems with the metadata contained in the image may occur. some programs do not store these data with when you save the changed image. therefore, this information is lost from the EXIF and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digicam; provides two options for rotation. the easiest way to view and rotate it with the right mouse button. in the sub-menu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, right click the thumbnail and select F2 rename from the context menu. note that you will retain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you delete a photo from & digikam, it will be moved into the bin of & kde; moved. F8 image deletion or Del if you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift + Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">& quot; My date list; organizes your photos using the data. & digicam; used for either the EXIF date or if this is not available, the date of the last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the date page at the bottom of the date view to show you only the photos of the selected days.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keyword provides a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. keywords are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by choosing this keyword or a search again.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all photos that have been marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Keywords can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to logically organize your keywords. you can also fold sections of the tree & quot; My keywords, so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. you can also use your keywords in other programs.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking either on & quot; My keyword, or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword. if you have clicked on an existing keyword, this becomes the substitchword of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by dragging it to the desired position in the tree and put it there. then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to postpone the keyword. a keyword can only be in the tree at a time.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting the keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My keyword; change.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as Album icon, click the image with the right mouse button and select as a Album preview in the context menu. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">As soon as you have selected the photos you want to use with a keyword, you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My keyword, drag and drop it. alternatively, you can also right-click on the thumbnail of the images and select the keywords from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can add a photo with any number of keywords. the picture will be displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way you can set a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was taken, one for the event where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keywords, this will be displayed in the main window under the preview of the image.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword by right-clicking the photo's context menu and selecting Remove from the keywords menu. the menu only shows the keywords assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view displays a timately adjustable histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection box can be moved using this histogram. to select a timeline, you only have to click on the bottom rectangle of the selection frame, which displays the time unit. this will display all associated images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below you can enter a title and save your selection, which will appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Cover all elements of the database: names, ratings, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and more in the future.</seg>
<seg id="125">Next he search box is a small lamp that becomes green when the search finds matches. if you click here the filtering is deleted and all images are displayed again. if the search has not found, then the lamp becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The advanced search tool is hidden in the tab on the left side bar with binoculars. if you open it you will see a simple search box as described above. you can search this search here but as a live search, which always filters what you typed as a search criterion. after saving it, he will filter in the list.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are satisfied with your selection, press OK and the search is performed. the results will be displayed in the My Search list in the main window. if you want to change your selection after the search, you only need to select the corresponding entry from the view My search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">When you select search, the search form returns with the previously entered search information. if you choose to edit an advanced search, the Advanced search dialog appears to change your previous search. more information can be found in the section The Tools for Advanced Search.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Delete in the Search context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">Advanced Search provides you with an advanced search form with many search parameters that you can search for in certain fields of & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Albendatabase. all rules are automatically added to the search group / search group can be added or deleted from it. each option can be linked to other via the logical operations All..., One..., None... or at least... create.</seg>
<seg id="132">& digicam; characterizes every image by a long number with a special technique called the hair algorithm. this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures. the smaller the difference between two image signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area in which you can drop each image to find a similar one. if you move an image from somewhere over the symbol of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar then it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free-hand color sketch: draw a quick sketch and & digicam; finds the suitable pictures. also here, a threshold value can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can zoom in or zoom in with the mouse wheel or hold it and move it. move it while clicking the left mouse button. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this assumes, of course, that your pictures contain geo data.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below, you can specify a name for your geo-filter, which will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a live-folder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digicam; provides a luminaire in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Add to the luminaire from the context menu. the selection will be added to the light table and its window is opened.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview bar you can drag and drop the images you want to compare in the left or right area of the window. a small arrow indicates which copy in which window area is to be seen. if you select preview from the toolbar and carry out zoo and deportation operations on one of the images, you will also be able to compare the same area of both pictures.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited for sorting out quickly from a series of images. if you use combination mode from the toolbar, the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas to compare. use the left mouse button on any thumbnail to view it on the left. this makes it easy to work through a series of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal deletion actions also work directly from the luminaire like F4 file...</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both preview images in the illuminated table. this makes it easy for example to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each section you will find a built-in pivoting function that you can see on the crossed arrows. to pivot the visible area of the image, you must click on it and hold the & LMB. in the preview button, both pictures will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zoom works as well as in other views. simply use the Zoom knob under the pictures or Ctrl key to zoom in and out. this happens in both pictures when you are in preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">Digital Stock Management considers every part of the process following after the image has been taken up to the final output and the permanent storage. each of the photos records, scans or stores digital photos performs a form of digital stock management. most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient manner.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up, find, protect and use photos. we focus on the procedures for digital photographers the & digicam; use. we consider downloading, renaming, removing, converting, grouping, backing, optimizing, waiting and export of image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital inventory management records, indexes, categorizes, secures, searches, transforms, confectioned and exports contents that have a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is data that provides information about or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer then you will need no longer to find a specific photo without inventory management. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then use certainly not & digikam;. the approach to store the metadata in both a database and in the image files ensures very fast searches and a secure archiving which you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you get anything into your system is the structure information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you need to decide whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive, etc.</seg>
<seg id="151">You may be happy with this structure. vacation pictures can be quickly found on your location unless you were in one year several times the same place. the rest of the photos will be organized on the basis of your date. if you do have enough photos then you will be subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements, e.g. versioning of photos, archiving, workflows, constant importation of pictures on different subjects and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and work files simplifies backup strategy and migration. you will always know whether you are looking for an original or a derivative image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend to save the metadata option in the settings page of the metadata in & digikam. this ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are written to the file. if you forget it, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database to the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what? to do this, & digikam, providing them with a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, as you should now assign templates, captions and a rating to each photo. of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value. this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos while working.</seg>
<seg id="158">Now let's start with keywords, keywords, as you often say in other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digikam; automatically set the tree for you or insert the images to the right place. the sorting of the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by pulling one subtree to another.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graph shows how different metadata is overlapping. this is a very crude representation, since each block of metadata exists in truth from many sections. file names and calendar dates are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to captions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to let anybody see your photos just, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it closer, then start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you that this is the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! you start dreaming to have associations, memories, the historical period is back present, you may even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others looking at your photos, the title may be more important than the picture itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to convey the meaning to the viewer, to help him about the subject you moved has to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digikam, you can store any amount of text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as a label. if you export your images in web galleries, these labels will be exported to your wishes in the labeling and / or the title of the web gallery system.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find another city without a navigation system? was it not a boring planet in front of Google Earth? well, because with pictures the train of spatial presentation is now already at speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of using geolocation are countless and will become even deeper in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your trips using images with geographic data. & digicam; can also export kml files that you can open with GoogleMaps. you can also export the images to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with Google Maps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a pun with copyright and denotes the use of copyrights to remove restrictions on distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions, thus also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information in the furnishings page of & digikam; as information should be stored:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization may not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author's title: linked to the author. this field contains the photographer's job title. examples of this may be titles such as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for providers): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer works for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organisations can be listed here, which you provide the image to others.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they offer no protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calculator can delete or modify the metadata embedded in the image. for individuals this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique for each picture. & digicam; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: disk failures, disk failure, electric shocks, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, disaster prevention, life time, temperature, data size, spread superstition</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire. these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you even in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section it's about problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the world's largest data recovery shop, has some interesting statistics which reasons have a data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">In order to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, these must be handled carefully and you can't trust you for more than a few years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality, which last longer, get harder and considerably more expensive. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for yourself.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD disks can be unreadable but you can reduce this risk by using good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest ones, but you write much more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors even when they have just been written. therefore, they use a control sum mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data is only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control sums. despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a convenient program called IsoBuster which apparently works miracles in CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and Linux, but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read corrupt data from damaged disks, hard disks, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to win the format war against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that was said to CDs and DVDs is also true for the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recording device on high-quality media in a non-propriated format. then read the media with a description, date & author mark and store them on a clean, dark dry and protected spot. don't forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that this media can read.</seg>
<seg id="186">Diskmanufacturers are keeping your statistics for themselves. their manufacturers' warranties include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives: discard study</seg>
<seg id="187">The most common error reason, SMART is the most common error reason, SMART cannot detect these errors. some errors identified by SMART indicate the imminent failure. these are in particular read errors and shift counters. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you backup the files, but these losses can usually be restored without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices do not matter much, it looks different on devices with computer chips and high speed processes. these can cause serious damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause blocked keyboards, complete data loss, hardware obsolescence, destroyed motherboards and other defects. therefore protect yourself from the unavoidable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against power peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs a part of the energy heat and grounded the rest. it is usually available in the form of a connector bar.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for overvoltage protection, you should make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also pay attention to protecting against lightning strikes and thereby protecting the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used on your computer, you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected. some manufacturers also produce overvoltage contactors which also have a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a wearable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially developed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you with a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in a interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltages, these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs. some models even allow them to continue working until the current is running. if you buy a UPS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as a overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is of interest.</seg>
<seg id="196">Keep in mind the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare it's security with the cost of avoiding these. a high-quality overvoltage protection can cost you up to & euro; 20. this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it. finally, remember to always remember all cables before you go on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can use it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer that allows you to store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are compared to the hard drives at home however very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollars; 500. in addition, you need to send the data about the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution. therefore, it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are limited to photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your pictures in full resolution online. the professional version provides you more, in case of Flickr more. for $25 per year you get unlimited storage, which should be verified in reality first.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, the web solutions are very safe. transmission errors are cleaned automatically thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain on the computer. all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when it happened in your hardware. all of these errors remain undetected until you someday open a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise. nobody seems to have ever thought of it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, as they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk errors on a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle started its own initiative with its btrf file system. this is still in alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms used by ZFS and is also available for Linux; but it is not yet part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in the notebook and 46% for desktop systems. notebooks are already 50% of thefts.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it causes less damage, such as theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users know only very few viruses and under & Linux; has long been sighted any more.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the widened file systems. you will find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden interruption during surgery is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not saved completely before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: wrong, theft, and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Digital cameras sensors are 1-2 aperture setting from fundamental physical limits. meaning that while the technology continues to develop, there is a natural boundary for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is worse. even DSLR cameras have their limit at 10-12 megapixels. even DSLR cameras have their limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard disk today for 100 & euro; so do not make anyone responsible for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected each year by a data loss. thus, secure your data according to a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous as the reinstallation of your operating system, the exchange of disks or the resizing of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backups on an external SATA drive daily. if, then one day, a flash hits you if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget aircraft accidents: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, disaster prevention always means a non-local storage. bring your backups up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another benefit of physical separation: as said above, a common reason for losing data despite securing the panic. if you have a backup that is not available immediately, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Difference protection: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot of two times: the complete backup and the last difference protection.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. it creates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time at which such backup was made. this backup comes to a versioning system the next with the exception that it is only scanned and not continuous.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference of files that have actually been changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important images right after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach leaves you enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time, you come up with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. in the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month.</seg>
<seg id="226">Themes: metadata, IPTC stored in the image file, associated XMP files, original retained, memory, scalability, media, reinventing images and metadata, copying the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing devices,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable images survive the next 40 years, that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you have to consider all that is being said today with caution and re-evaluate during the time passes. unfortunately, there is no other way to consider a certain vigilance. every 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered on the basis of the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">So virtualization is available for everyone. so if you have an old system that is important to read your images, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your storage and security technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist expression for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have included the scalability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. for * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and relocate it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the dmesg command if your new record was detected by the system, but do not append it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollars; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & dollars; parted resize / dev / sdc + dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc # source; resize2fs / dev / sdc # modify the size of the fs if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no software that can read it, you can create it yourself. this task becomes easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market, so you shouldn't use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard that should replace the GIF. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC meta data, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG may store gamma- and chromaticity data for enhanced color assignments for heterogeneous platforms. the disadvantage is that there are relatively many administrative information but not as many as TIFF and a slow compression.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF has been widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a loss-free compression algorithm (Deflate). it manages high-quality images, but requires very large files. however, with some cameras you can store your images in this format.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The digital Negative file format is a license-free and open form format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG is developed on the basis of the need to unify the camera file formats. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and committed to the use of metadata.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why to replace 2001, Adobe its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a coding technology that allows users to embed their data into a file itself.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording, mostly in raw format. XMP is suitable as it stores metadata separately from the image file. however, it may cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file, and as mentioned above, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. the activities of DCMI include the work on architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI working groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and enlightening efforts to achieve a wide-ranging acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images are on the camera edit, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them to your raw archive. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For fine editing you can use external programs. if you edit the images with & Edit, then you should add the metadata again. these were probably cut off from the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the edited images for copyright with a digital watermark. export them to web galleries, encode in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digikam. in the Adding a Photos to an album, you will find a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your AlbenBase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digicam; to use, connect it to the computer, turn the camera to display mode and turn it on. a further description can be found in the handbook of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect with your camera. if the connection is made, a ferous indicator will appear at the bottom end and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera will appear. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for the application will be shown on the camera for any file, photos, movies, music, etc.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. you can view the properties of an item or its metadata with the properties and metadata from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">This information is the same as with the metadata-sidebar from the main window of & digikam; or image processing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is to click on the download button and then download the selection of all. this downloads all photos from their camera into a single album in & digikam.. downloading the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were downloaded safely into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all the photos, you can only select the desired one with the default selection methods of & kde; as soon as you have selected the photos, use the download button and then download the selected one. the selected download button is digested until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, a New Download option is available. these images have not been downloaded from & digikam. in this case, the new pictures will be marked with a star in the preview window. if you select this option, only the new pictures will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you use the All Download or Selected buttons, a dialog appears that allows you to select the target album in which the photos will be stored. the list of existing albums will be shown in the section My Albums. then select the destination album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After selecting the target album, press OK, and & digicam; loads the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all of them at once by using the Delete All Delete button. if you just want to delete some, you need to select them first and then delete selected deleted ones.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to recover photos that you deleted from the camera. you should not copy the photos into the garbage dump of & kde; you should carefully check if the photos were successful in a & digikam album, before you delete them from the camera. if you want to completely delete the camera file, you should do this via the camera system, since this is much quicker.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras often do not use a particularly meaningful name for the photos. the file names are usually reused after the photos are deleted from the camera. this can lead to double filenames in case you load photos from different shooting galleries into the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time on which the image was taken into the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for file-based subdirectories. if you use this latter option, a folder will automatically be created per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">During the transfer, three more options open before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two relate the data about the author in the standard auto ID section. if you select this, the corresponding entries from the exif information will be copied to the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you want a different date format than the standard format, you can, for example, use the prefix photo-% Y-% m-% d% H:% M:% S. for further adjustments, you should read the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera filename, you have the option to change the file names in lowercase, or in upper case letters if you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & digicam; used for a photo, is displayed below the name the camera provides in preview. your settings for renaming are saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digicam; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to make automatic turn during loading. not all cameras provide this information. in the section Toolbar metadata you can read more details about the information your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic turn is usually turned on, and if your camera doesn't deliver this information, it can be digitized; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to disable automatic turn, use the Advanced button and select the automatic turn in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available, it can be used to automatically create sub-albums in the target album. all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub-album. not all cameras provide this information. in the section Toolbar Meta data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally switched off, and in this case digitized; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you must disable this option. use the Extended button and select the Date-based basal option at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the download button. then select Upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears in which you can select the files to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done & digikam, you where the images are to be uploaded. a folder chooser appears for the camera. select the folder you want and press OK to start uploading. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this means a position indicated in longitude and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. the determination of the data can be carried out by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers, it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses an aircraft to cartographic an area by automatic recording of the GPS data. environment planners, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser with a click that displays the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digicam; users who want to locate the location of the photo, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that lexv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, semitrailings and map references. there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via a reworking of the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographic attribution (manual) and last via the manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few that work with GPS receivers. either as a map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done using gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you must store these data in the gpx format, since this is the only format supported by the geographic classification module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract and correlate the data of images and the GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data then you can use this script that works with the ExifTool of Phil Harvey. it uses the accidentals of hairy coordinates created e.g. by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digicam; try to give you as much control over its work processes as possible. there are many settings that change the behavior of & digikam. to access these settings, you need to choose the Edit menu; you can switch between these by clicking on the icons on the left.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select Action can be displayed on the previewed preview or start image editing. in doing so, you set the default behavior of & digikam; specify when you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written in the corresponding IPTC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author's title is a synonym for publisher: this field should contain the professional designator of the photographer. this may be designations such as photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the author field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify the name that the photo offers. this must not be the author if this is for a news agency, such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be registered here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the appropriate IPTC-field. by this it is achieved that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of & digikam;. these metadata are also available to other programs and can be imported in & digikam, without having to go missing.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save image lettering as embedded captions (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the captions embedded in the images. attention: with pictures that already contain labels, these are overwritten by the Edit.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse cursor is in the main window over a file. depending on the selected option, this information will be displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digitized; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digikam; to view, you can add the file extensions of this list and remove. each file in a & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="292">You can reset the default settings again by pressing the Update button to the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">Each time you open the light table, these settings are turned on. however, some images have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available. the option & quot; In the whole image size ladenquot; you should only use on fast machines. if you have one, then you can get better picture results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image editing uses a black background behind the shown photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can disable the toolbar if you use image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the image. these colors are set here. in image processing, this View Mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling it is meant that the images are encoded in higher resolution of the luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for more explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG-compression setting, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality since PNG uses lossless algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">The TIFF-files option can be used to compress the default compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it has no effect on the image quality since the defect algorithm works loss-free.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the setting of loss-free JPEG 2000 files, you can save losses-free. even if you select the loss-based setting, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG. when this paragraph is written, metadata has not yet been supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the earlier versions of & digikam, image editing was only a picture viewer for photos. currently it is rapidly developing into a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard assumption is that all green pixels are the same. if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels in odd rows, this creates a lattice pattern in the output. this option draws the image a little bit soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when white balance is not set. standard is to use a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default is the top lights, so the parts of your images are burned because of the inability of your camera to catch the pointed lights, as continuous white. the setting colors trigger creates some unusual results as it shows the pointed lights in various roses. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red. & digikam; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the still not saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the Reconstructing option, you get the possibility to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably have to set it slightly higher than the default 1. however, this can be done later in the image options of the & digicam; image processing. in order to keep the time for the demo icing, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demo icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the partial raw data that come from the color filtered image sensor that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">When digicam; and Dcraw provides you three alternatives: bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD Interpolation. after some tests it looks as if AHD Interpolation (for Adaptive Homogenes-Directed) was the first algorithm that was used by Dcraw. however, it creates color artefacts on the edges.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you are familiar with the color deviation of your lenses, you can set the red and blue corrections here. this is certainly the best method for a color grading correction, since it is carried out during the shell conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the colour information and gives instructions how to be given again. there are also LCMS and & digikam; information about translating color information from a color space to the other means that the colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when an image is opened in image processing / color management module start with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile Folder Set here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can save all your profiles.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of the ICC profile You have the option & quot; standard source; to deposit for your profiles. everything can be changed when opening the raw file.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here just your pictures color does not manage the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit the camera manufacturer and model that you use. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which do not contain any color-mapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw Gamma is not correcting for conversions at 16 bit depth.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the Soft Proof profile with which you can emulate how your image would be returned from a device. this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite obvious what color profile is intended for. unfortunately, not with the models from Canon. therefore here follows a table of cameras and profiles which fit together. this answer is, of course, inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension lets you realize the style for the finish: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portrait and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image plugin interface. it is an interface supported by a number of & kde; image viewer and image processing. by delivering this interface, & digikam; many modules support that have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has the KIPI modules installed, you will see a list of available modules. select the modules you want to use, and these will then be loaded by & digikam. these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will also find some in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">You can get further information (in English) about the KIPI modules under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">Slide show settings should be easy to understand. the upper regulator adjusts the time between the picture transitions, usually 4-5 seconds. the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off, which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features on the left hand side show a list of all the currently supported cameras. on the right side there is a button automatic detection, which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure the camera is properly connected, switched on and in the picture display mode.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end, you can set the path for USB and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active when you have selected a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list. you need to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / echo, on which you mount your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digicam; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it to display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check if & digikam; the camera automatically recognises. if not, you can set camera models and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the Camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this will be displayed in the menu cameras of the main window. if you have more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option of acknowledgement dialog for moving &gt; images in the trash bin, you can set the interviewer from & digikam; when you delete a photo in an album. in the sections delete a photo and delete an album you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right sidebar can be used silently by & digikam; apply if you use the option to apply changes to the right sidebar without any queries. otherwise, you need to apply the changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also display the welcome screen from & digikam at startup. this may speed up the start of & digikam..</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting Beim start looking for new photos obliges & digikam; the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos to look for. this extends the start time of & digikam;. if something from the base folder was deleted, & digikam; you, if it should delete them from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be in & digitized; used to customize the main window to suit your taste. you can select these settings under Settings design from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs are defined in plain text files. if you are interested in a new design for & digikam, you will find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digicam; includes fast image editing with some basic tools. you can use it to view your photos and to correct and improve. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the item Display / Edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">Image editing includes a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digikam. so you may not be part of your distribution. for more information on the KIPI modules, see the Image Processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the file name, current file number, magnification factor, and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of image editing will change your photos. none of the functions will change the original photo before using the Save or Save button from the toolbar. note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you might want to make a copy of your image before you change it. you can do this by file Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the restore from the File Restore menu or using the Reproducing image editing button in the toolbar. you will then lose any change you have done in the photo since the last storage.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost every action of image editing can be undone or restored. the last action you can undo by editing Edit back or restored by selecting Edit Restore from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently, you should make use of the keyboard shortcuts, Ctrl + -Z for undo and remember Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; press the undo or restore button in the toolbar for a moment longer, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between will also be undone.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, image down or the entries in the File menu. if you made changes in the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save it.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the photo in and out in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: choose the magnification factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode. you come to the normal view where you can use the Esc key. if you do not want this, you can change this in the Edit Settings dialog; you can view it from the Edit menu. see the Edit section for editing image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can choose to print in the File Image menu and get the standard & kde; print dialog. you can customize the settings here before printing your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual pictures or whole sets. entire image sizes can be printed out of your selection. you only need to select the images using the standard methods and select from the menu Album Exportieren print wizard. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digicam; main window has a sidebar at the right edge, providing important information and actions for the selected images. the same side bar is available without the navigation file, also in image editing. it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same tab allows the sidebar to appear or disappear again.</seg>
<seg id="355">The text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the labels are copied to the EXIF and IPTC fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are reshaped. if you want to use the IPTC label field in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">Once you have commented, use either the user button or simply switch to the next image, the labels will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the user button, there is a button More. with this, you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also write the metadata in the files. however, this is always done when you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written in the IPTC field Urgency. the code follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword list shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used previously.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word. you can quickly restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword. this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom is a further relief when entering keywords in a series of pictures. if you have typed different keywords, they are saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree. all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword in the IPTC field.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this is only applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection, if you want to provide a selection with a keyword, please read the Keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The keyword filter page bar is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. normally, the left side bar is used with their album, date, keyword and search views. if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop keywords. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it from the right sidebar and put it on the selection.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the images on a calendar day. the keyword filter is based on no keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. they were selected using Ctrl + a, and then a keyword from the right keyword tree was dragged to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks whether this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be disabled in Settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created it and find that it needs to be one or its, you can easily change this by double clicking on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry in which the database is searched. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can set an advanced search across all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button grouping. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution there.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly adapted it to & digikam, s concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner come from a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanner and that the colors that you print or publish in the web to those from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the topic comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed choices at every point of the image processing workflows. additionally, links with deeper information will allow you to make your own informed choices so that you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow satisfies all six criteria listed below, you don't need to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB color space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image editions are by email or the web, where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should one use a different color space and thus have to worry about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB in comparison to the colors that we really can see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the horseshoe region, and the colors in sRGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent site and click Info and then on information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to callify my monitor if I decided to work only in sRGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you work in sRGB color space or not, you have to callify your monitor, since sRGB assumes that your; onitor is callified on sRGB. if you work as in the color space of sRGB, then you must either use your monitor on the sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve an image in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The normalize, smoothing, automatic comparison and contrast extend from the menu Correction Automatic correction attempt automatic from your colors to make the best. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the density values over the entire image, so that the darkest point black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its color shading. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">Balance: this method adjusts the intensity factor of the color of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible. sometimes the same number of pixels produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only rubbish. it is a very powerful operation that either causes wonders in an image or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic comparison: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it detects the dark and bright shades and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Broaden your contrast: this method improves the contrast and luminosity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values in the widest possible range and a new image of all values in between. this is only visible with selected images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The White Balance from & digicam; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photograph.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is a bit limited because of a color space with 8-bit per color. so if you can be too far from the original image, areas with overexposure may occur. if you can perform the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by Pawel T. Jochym by Pawel T. Jochym.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side, both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen. the preview will be dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original shot again, click on the underwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target image has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is indicated as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">The histogram shows a histogram that is dynamically changed once you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels have very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your total is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shade adjustment lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or even dim them down.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. in this way, the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will get the combined result displayed in the white balance. this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save As and Load knobs make exactly this. any settings of the white balance you have set can be saved to a text file and recharged later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button will reset all filter values to their default values and the associated neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original. if you save them, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the coding depth per color channel of the edited image. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high quality images. this coding requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool can be found in the menu under color value correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time and allows you to use it for several photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same error and therefore always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digicam; tool color effects provides you four color effects, a solar installation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also known as Sabatier, was an effect that was created by exposing a partially developed pressure to a short flash light and then completing the development of the image. this had the effect that the brighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the Solarisation. at approx. 50% intensity the picture shows what is chemically possible. another increase finally creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar isation. the original picture is the (1) and that processed the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simple, it beautifies many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">The name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make it a film of choice for natural photographers. Velvia's strongly saturated colours are too much for a few photographers, especially those with hardly any sceneries.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeats the strength of the neon light. in large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon that you want to correct the color contrast and luminosity of the photos. you can experiment to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor light conditions, you can get the reverse problem: one too large saturation. even in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. all changes you can carry out can be seen in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the tool is located in order to improve exposure. even if the dialogue with this tool works very complicated, you need only the area of the slide for the purpose described here. more concrete the three sliders below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph, three sliders are clicked into which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn is to shift the control and watch how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right side, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview will be dynamically updated based on the settings of the image. on the left hand side, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scale: with this selection box it is possible to set whether the histogram is represented with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera the linear representation is often the most useful. in this case, the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic distribution is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three regulators: the uppermost part for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color brush shapes can be used to preview the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows, middle and bright tones. in addition, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values interactively as with the input values. for example, the compression of the output values can be used to create a flared image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatic: this button sets the image values automatically depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons the preset values can be stored in the file system and loaded later. to do this, the Gimp Levels format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and three color pipettes, the input is automatically readjusted for all shadows, means and shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Overexposure Indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you only get the effect displayed in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">The left side shows half of the original and the target image. the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right side, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifier channel: this drop-down box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Beside this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures taken with a digital camera is usually the linear mode of the most useful. for pictures with large areas of a constant color, the linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case, logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you shift a Curvace to the right, e.g. the bright notes, you can see that these bright tones correspond to darker parts and that the corresponding pixel pixels are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">A red marker is visible on the preview of the original. if you move this marker to the area you want to change, a suitable line is displayed on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. any curve you created can be stored in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp format.</seg>
<seg id="438">When you create this method and the three color pipettes buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sun tones. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The Overexposure Indicator option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if pixels are found in more than one channel, the combined result is displayed. this is an indicator, i.e. you only get the effect displayed in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo, which was corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and Sun tones were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The & digicam channel mixer; image editing is a tool for improving color channels or changing the color shades of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another sophisticated tool for mixing the hues of the images. you can edit it from the menu color channel mixer of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">The channel selection box lets you select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by considering the relative distribution and precipitation. the left area of the window shows you a preview.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are right below: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you want to keep luminance, the image will retain the general brightness as well, as the channel mixer is then THE tool for creating great black-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially if you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible ruff that comes from the farbrauschen. color-brewing consists of small room artefacts that do not appear at the same place in the color channel and their noise pattern in each channel looks different. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by allowing you to reduce the color space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save As and Load Buttons are used for precisely this purpose. you can save any mixer setting for later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Overexposure Indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you only get the effect displayed in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been readjusted. preserve the Luminance option is enabled. the original image can be seen in (1) and the edited image at (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of her ability to deal with abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step since color images can be easily converted to the computer.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scene images and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves the landscape, maritime scenes and aerial photos. similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate moonlight scenes at the time of day. thus, similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepithaton: produces warm light and middle tones while adding a little cold in the shattles. this is very similar to the process of bleaching a pressure and the redevelopment in a Sepiatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digicam; apply tools texture you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a screen, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right raises the impression of the depth or three-dimensionality of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper box effect has been applied in the photo below. the original image is (1) and the modified one (2) to see. the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digicam; Add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around an image.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a beholder in the limits of a photograph is not an easy task. one way to keep his attention is to put the image into a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your picture. throughout, the image transmits with a coloured line, Niepce surround it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), barred it with a nice three-dimensional frame which is ideal for a clover effect and decorative element add a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the value range for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The pattern decorated with the frame will be larger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for the print of the images, especially when you have used the tool after aspect ratio before.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can insert easily a formatted text into an image at any place. this also goes to several places when you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply insert the text and place it with the mouse. use text direction, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the "OK" button. once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digicam; apply tool stencil you can place a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image Template apply in image editing can be used to place templates on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no limitations concerning size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to minimize the file size of the template. if you want to add your template of the & digicam; template database, just send an e-mail in English to the & digicam; mailinglist digikam-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you copied the template files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the templates, a tree view appears, which reflects the folder structure of the template folder. the selection of a folder automatically updates the thumbnail of the templates.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview you will find three buttons to change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this knob enlarges the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Smaller: this button reduces the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you need to reduce the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below the template. to do so, take the picture and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your picture. the image will then be adjusted automatically to the thumbnail size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digicam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but creates grainy images, especially in dark areas.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blurring mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharper. in fact, it sharpens not a bit, it works rather psychically. you can use it to remove atmospheric vapor and it makes a really good job. the algorithm has been taken out of Gimp and it is copyright protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is possibly the best of the three because it really improves sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjusting.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitized images require a correction of sharpness. this is because the digitization process has to merge color with only minimal differences to one color point. this in turn results in blurred edges a little blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually need more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG pictures, a camera has often been used for internal sharpening. images in raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners turn a focus filter already during reading the image. if you disable it, you get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the focus keystroke. you can call this with the menu entry for correcting sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should be careful, however, since the results do not appear very natural: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also enhances the hiss. generally, the most suitable technique for sharpening an image refocus the tool. you can achieve it via the menu item Correction. under refocus you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques to sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crispy. the solution to draw the image a little bit soft is much easier than sharpen it. use the tool to soften the menu entry to make softening and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. you can see a demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help you to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should first be tried out. an increase in the radius or the amount amplify the effect. if you make the blurring mask too strong, noise and the impression of grates will produce close to sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, you should better sharpen images in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. thus, a minimal difference can be defined for an edge of the filters. in this way areas with a soft change between tones are exempted from sharpen and therefore beauty flaws in faces, heavens and water surfaces avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image the (2). blurred masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digicam; tool refocus refocus a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted extraction filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than attempting to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filters. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blurring mask. refocus generally achieves better results than blurred masking. you can start it from the menu by refocusing colors in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauß's folding. the Gauß's folding has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical results also from the source pixels that are far from the original source pixel. in most cases the FIR Wiener Inverse of the Gauß's folding is affected very strongly from the remote pixels, causing undesired results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should result in 1 good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in the correlation may help to reduce artefacts. the correlation may be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase of the noise filter can help you to reduce artefacts. the filter can take values from 0-1. however, values above 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very poor.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius for the sharpness of the Gauß. use this parameter if your sharpness is' Gauss'. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a nonzero value, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you choose large values for the circular sharpness or the Gauss's sharpness. note however that the module is very slow if you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save As and Load Buttons are used for precisely this purpose. any refocussing parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all cutting, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before otherwise changing the image. the reason for this is that much operations are not immediately visible, but later leave unpleasant artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you want to read and compress pictures, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">In general, Insharp Maskieren produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the unintentional masking uses a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blurring. for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lineare filter. practically, the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the sharpness mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocussed image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color image must be corrected. this picture was taken with an analog camera. the unfocussed result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about the methods of sharpshooting in digital pictures you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The slider regulates the sharpness of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink tinting allows for a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, you can adjust it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools for removing unwanted artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The painting algorithm has been developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg Project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration process. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings more fine, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail maintenance p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to smooth smoothness over the picture. whereas larger values are mainly smoothed over homogeneous regions and details are sharp. a value of 0.9 should receive details in such a way that no sharpening is necessary afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional dependence Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes out evenly in all directions, while a value close to 1 only smooths in one direction. if you have a film grain or a CCD smoke will produce a high value wavelike-like patterns. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooten [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more smoothed. this is necessary if very much noise is present, as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: specifies how often the algorithm is passed through. normally, 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle step length [5, 90]: angle dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if alpha small is selected, it should also be small. make sure that small angles generate a long term. therefore, you should choose this value as much as possible and for your needs acceptable.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrated step width [0,1, 10]: integrated step width in pixels. you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never greater than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation use: the more the quality you get by selecting this option is minimal. it doubles the duration but we recommend it to let it out.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save As and Load knobs make exactly this. any setting of image errors can be saved to a text file and then recharged later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="529">The module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is a peculiar black artifact in the foreground that caused by a bad film deposit during the trip. the original image is visible under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digicam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artifacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grained noise which can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you only need the sub-window details and the subwindow Advanced Settings can stay with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter per pixel is needed and can blur the image. the area indicated by the radius is smoothed over the image and the color in it is smoothed and therefore minor errors corrected.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the focus level. this value sets the pixel pitch the filter looks forward to determine luminance changes. if it is increased, noise peaks will be deleted. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details cannot be preserved and noise or lubrication occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls edge accuracy for sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, it is not possible to remove the entire noise or noise peaks. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak sound or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend either to change colour or luminance to improve an image. these settings do not influence the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either to change color or luminance to improve an image. these settings do not influence the smoothing process that is checked by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma variance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance levels of the darker areas, which are typically stronger.</seg>
<seg id="541">Attenuation: controls the adjustment of phase damping. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of the luminance density. if it is increased, the edges appear smoother when it is too high, the edges may appear blurred.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store under and load: these buttons are used exactly for it. all the noise reduction parameters you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crispy for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a bit soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use this tool to sharpen the softer with the menu item Correction softness and experiment with the smoothness. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digicam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your images. it is very well adapted to remove Gauss's noise, film grain, scratches, compressionartefacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or subsequently digitalized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texture conversion. the texture statement is performed using a different tool, image error correction. the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artefacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, even far away from compression in some areas. as a lossy compression algorithm, it produces some compression & quot; artifacts quot; - small standards that can be seen in the uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The Save As and Load knobs make exactly this. any setting of photo restoration can be saved to a text file and then recharged later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="551">The module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera to an Ilford (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grain on the faces.</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time texture was applied to an old colour photograph created using a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts caused by the scanner lights and the photographic paper. the original image is visible under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digicam; tool Hotpixel allows Hotpixel images to be removed with a CCD camera, eight have been removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high-quality raw mode. many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; & quot; Bright Pixelquot; to remove on a photo with a dark image subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the dark image button. the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important to directly record the dark image after a new hot or bright pixel by CCD defective.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the appropriate darkening image to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard will remember the last dark image and will automatically load it in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview help you to correct the result within the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with current settings.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of the adjacent pixel is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear interface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of quadratic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is visible under (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digicam; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially those in the medium and large photo format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor area evenly. instead & quot; vignetting & quot; (shade) it the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which increases the necessary shutter speed under certain circumstances so that it is impossible to use the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also be using a center filter, an opening of f / 16 or smaller, since otherwise non-sharpness effects are caused by motion.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the wide exposure ranges of today's film and color or gray scale depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a CenterFilter by using an equivalent transformation on a raw image without this filter. the tool Vignetting correcting applies the transformation using a CenterFilter on a picture. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controls you can control the vignetting correction filter and with three further exposures of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity damping at the point of the greatest density of the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which corresponds to an optical filter with a lens aperture of 1, or randomly a light intensity of 2, reducing it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Brightness, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction reduces the brightness of pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide you with positive values, since you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer readjustment of the exposure of the target image, you leave the values for luminance / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digicam; image processing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignetting correction to an image. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digicam; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. color distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree covers the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, but flattens on the edges. this correction is not applied in the mold.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of the fourth degree corrects the distant corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometrical distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the thickness of distortion second degree. with negative values, barrel distortion units can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of the distortion of the fourth degree. this value has a stronger effect on the edges than in the middle of the image. for most lenses, the 'Corner Parameters' has the opposite sign of the general parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resizes the image size and makes correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive the image resizes.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brighten: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog box shows the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The correction or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all changes of the size or size. the best way to do this is to perform this correction as the first one. if you re-cut an image and then perform a sound-like correction, the effect would be evidently the wrong one.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal guide line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to display the dotted lines. move it to an important place, such as the edge of the sea or a building wall, in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. subsequently, you can correct the sound / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them using the trimming tool in the menu Transformers from image processing or via the Zoom regulator of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motifs such as photos from the front, frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of a tonne correction on a church in Norway. the original image can be seen in (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method for simulating infra-red film of the GimpGuru.org web page that is accessible under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfra video, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity area of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters of filenizing and film sensitivity (ISO). activate the option to simulate the fine-grained texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO regulator changes the amount of film grain and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows become white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel, it does not make sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the colour information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digicam; filter film grain is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film grain on your images. this is known by classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, manufacturers mix large silver grains of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back to the past. the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere from everyday life. if you want this special gallery-like, road-photographic, grainy sight specially in your monochrome photos, you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the controller, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, set to ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white image. the original picture is the (1) and the edited the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digicam; Filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digicam; Filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting. natural pictures and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two regulators to influence this effect. the upper hand selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brush is better suited for large images. smoothing controls the smoothness or, looked from the other side, the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original picture is marked with the (1) and the processor is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel big picture is 1 and smooth 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The digicam; Filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a coal cap. images whose gradients vary slowly are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen yourself to sketch you.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper controller selects the pen size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothness).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digicam; filter engraving shapes your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digicam; filter engraving is a fast tool to replay your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure, in which color is not the most important in the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a gray, monochromatic landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distorting effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Blocks 1: divide the image into cells and make it look as if it is considered by blocks of glass.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the wavelengths 1, the image is distorted by another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects need a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time using the Stop button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of blurring effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom blurring: blurred the image along star-shaped lines starting from a focal point. this simulates the blurring a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blur: blurred the image by turning the pixels into a center. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance: blurred the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Blurring: blurred the image through horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: shoot from a car or train, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softening blur: blurs the image smoothly into the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharper sharpness: blurred the image by accidental shifting of pixels and simulates the blurring of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blur: find the colour font in the picture and blurred it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divide the photo into rectangular cells and then create it through the filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects need a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel this calculation at any time using the Stop button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this gives natural to your images a wet appearance. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="625">Drop size allows to change the size of drops. because the drop size does not automatically increase with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes changes the optical effect of drops on the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & digicam; image processing to keep an area free of raindrops. to do this use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter regentroff, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrop filter. the original image (1) shows a calm sunset and the edited image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can turn it into the right direction through mirrors or turning. you will find the tools in the menu Transformers rotate or transform mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom in a picture if the boundaries of the resolution are reached? how can you re-invent or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm that is used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select the Transformers size in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog is to be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for resizing uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to increase a small image with better quality, then try the tool to inflate.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. Spline interpolation to enlarge an image. & digicam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the New size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more smoothed. this is necessary if very much noise is present, as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save As and Load knobs are used exactly for it. enlarging each photo for photo can be saved as a text file and then recharged later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflating is very fast with what it does, but it can take a very long time and a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo bubbles by magnifying a small color image on the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard magnification for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Editing a photograph is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool for putting together a picture. to crop a photo, simply use the mouse to create a rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will see this rectangle then while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again, the area of the photo is cut out. this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by dragging on the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle will create by simply dragging it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button The trimming button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl + + X). use the file Save or File Save as in the File menu to save the newly cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="644">Depending on the aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format. in the portrait format, the larger value of the height and the transverse format of the width is always assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool According to aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches, inches or any other physical size. for example, you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and its aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog exist two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog you can use the Max. ratio button to cut the range to the greatest possible, depending on the selected ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool Following aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the trimming tool the next time, these settings will be displayed as default values depending on the orientation. the modified image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables so that the EXIF data reflect the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the merge help allow you to hide aids so that you can better assemble your pictures. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic partials are based on the principle of similarity. like the third rule, harmonious triangles are a possibility to share a rectangle in a similarly harmonious triangle centered on the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden middle is a division that refers to various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the flower petals of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden pitch is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number derives from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where each number is equal to the sum of their two previous numbers.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides more fluid support lines when you put a picture together. these help are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The golden spiral will bring you closer to your goal of achieving good results for your photos. compared to the third rule, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the gaze of the beholder along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow in this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. this rectangle is used to create the golden spiral. it should give something that the eye drops into the center of the composition. this can be a line or divergent objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangles are also derived from the above-mentioned golden spiral. its vertices are the middle points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are no matching triangles. diagonal to these lines can be placed a static object more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use golden triangles to break your frame, you create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic partitions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the color button you can set the color of the relief lines. if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast, the help lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">When you make a photo, it happens easily that you do not hold the camera vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are rotated around an angle. you can do this with the & digicam; image processing and the tool free rotation.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your picture with the slider angle. the values on this slide are specified in degrees. with the Preferences button you can set the slider to 0 degrees again. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are displayed on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the free rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines. after moving it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix this is to use the function Transformers cutting from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to crop the image is the Auto Circulation function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">Option Anti-aliasing smoothes the image a bit after rotation. note however the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed by a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically calculated. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle at the top left shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle at the bottom: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image is slightly greased. for a single adjustment, this effect is small, but two adjustments generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adjusted the perspective, you get unpleasant triangular holes in the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transformer cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The locking tool is used to move a part of the image into one direction and move the other part to the opposite. for example, a horizontal shear will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram.</seg>
<seg id="679">Rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you press presets, the angles are reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be shown and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown to the right of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and a horizontal line is displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the locking tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shearing, the image is wiped a bit. for a single shearing, this effect is usually negligible, but two loops generate twice as much blur and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After shearing, the image has blurred triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transformer cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digicam; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries are compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="684">Due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to list all file formats that are available on their system. however, they will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digikam; displays only files in formats that you know. this is done by means of the file extension and a comparison of those with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list, & digikam. you can change this list of file extensions the & digikam. in the Configuration section you will find more information on this.</seg>
<seg id="686">Nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression processes to digital images. this reduces redundant information in order to store image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. generally, there are better, smoother results than JPEG with the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also save lossless when specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw image format, you can read very helpful instructions in English under Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour. you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="690">Digicam; support the loading of raw images only with the program dcraw, which is available in & digipack; it supports more than 200 raw file formats. all supported cameras can be viewed at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coffin. the table below shows a short list of raw formats that are supported by & digikam;</seg>

<seg id="701">All image processing tools such as sharpening, softer, noise reduction, refocus, masking, & so;. use a uniform dialog box that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image. below you see & quot; Textile Applicquot; in this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar displays the status of the filter on the current image. left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area. these modes are:</seg>
<seg id="703">Vertical parts without duplicate. the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview range.</seg>
<seg id="704">Horizontally divide without duplicate. the upper area shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview range.</seg>
<seg id="705">The left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter.</seg>
<seg id="706">The upper section shows the original and the lower part shows the effect of the filter.</seg>
<seg id="707">'Mouse over 'style: displays the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original.</seg>
<seg id="708">(2): there are two buttons that you can switch on to display over- and underexposure. the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page.</seg>
<seg id="709">(3): the frame to select the preview. you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and place it on the part of the image you want to preview. previewing in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately.</seg>
<seg id="710">(5): in the lower left corner: here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values. all settings of the last use of the module are noted.</seg>
<seg id="711">The sidebar displays the essential information about the selected image and is largely self-explanatory. it is grouped in the following sections:</seg>
<seg id="712">Photo properties: displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos. these data come from EXIF data when they are available.</seg>
<seg id="713">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can zoom in or zoom in with the mouse wheel or hold it and move it. move it while clicking the left mouse button. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this assumes, of course, that your pictures contain geo data.</seg>
<seg id="714">& kcoloredit; is an editor for palettes files. the application can be used for editing color palettes and for selecting and naming colors.</seg>
<seg id="715">The Palettes files that are installed by & kde can be applied either to the whole system or only one user. in the latter case, they are in your Personal folder for & kde; -settings and hot user-defined color and last used colors.</seg>
<seg id="716">In the palette, you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders for files.</seg>
<seg id="717">The cursor is shown as a line in the pallet view. it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color.</seg>
<seg id="718">It shows the color beside it. the color is described under the pallet view. here, the color name can also be changed.</seg>

<seg id="725">Graphviz; programs are free layout programs. graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. so far there was no modern & GUI; program to visualize graphs. the programs that & graphviz; programs are outdated & X11; - or & tcltk; programs with only a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kimap; -Project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kimap; is a KDE program for viewing & Graphviz; -dot; -Graph; graphical programs are free layout programs. & kimap; displays graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user friendly & GUI; an. it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & Posters; and & konqueror; (so that a change in the graph in and out; the graph recomputed and displayed in & kgraphs;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graph in & kate; open or graph in & kgraphs; in a & kate; -Component to open</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems with about 1000 knots and a hack to represent more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Other required software: & kscreen viewer; is a & kde; program, which presupposes the & graphviz; tool & dot; for representation of graphs presupposed. in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in its own sub-window. initially, if you start & kscreen viewer; without starting an argument, the main window is empty as in the bottom screenshot. in this case, the toolbar contains only the symbol file and the (empty) list of recently opened files. click the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After selecting one or more & dot files, the main window looks like in the screenshot below:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is larger than the canvas. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special buttons, left and right with pressed & Alt; button);</seg>
<seg id="736">The zooming in both directions is limited by the factor of 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the file that is currently loaded in & kimap; loaded file has been modified by another program, the following window will appear:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph is to be reloaded or whether you want to ignore the change. & kPhotoviewer; you can also remember your decision, so that later as well. if you want to change your decision later, you can use the menu item Preferences kscreen viewer; set up..., see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you open a graph file outside a running & kimap; instance, & eg; in the file browser or at the command line, you have the choice whether you want to open a new & kimap; instance or to display the graph to be loaded in a sub-window of the already running instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but you can change it afterwards with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">At the start of the program you can reopen all graphs of your last session. again, you can save your choice both later and later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how to split the graph to several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph, which come to a page, should be fitted to this page. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a graphene distributed across multiple pages without header and with a different font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Erneut loading page gives the ability to specify behavior when a file has been modified on the hard disk, and eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (reload automatically or ignore the changes) or let the program consult each time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The opening page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of & kimap; to specify when a graph is opened outside of a current session. you can set a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a sub-window of the already running session) or specify that every time is requested.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session administration page gives the possibility to specify the start behavior of & kimap; you can set a default behavior (open or not open the files of the last session) or decide to be asked at every start.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which normally appears at a click in the main window with the & RMBs; opens up more possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can select from various & graphviz; layout algorithms. the entries, as described on the & graphviz website, are:</seg>
<seg id="750">& dot; algorithm, the standard for directed graph. it produces hierarchical or layered representations of aligned graphs. the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overlaps as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for uncoated graphene. it produces representations in accordance with the spring model. the Kamada Kawai algorithm is used, which is equivalent to statistical multi-dimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP algorithm creates a spring model layout for unfinished graphene. it uses the Fruchterman Reingold Heuristics, and includes a multi-gate trigger for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm arranges the nodes in a circle according to the description of Six und Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command that will then be executed by a shell. the command should accept the graph file as a parameter, and print the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command you can choose & eg; the & graphviz; -Algorithms will change, or even change the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>

<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and save new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan images: uses the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner that supports by the Sane project or another source such as video streams. to make this work you need to have Kooka and Sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you scan the menu entry images, a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer. select the source from which you want to fetch the image. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window appears to be able to replace the default of ducit's own to select your image accordingly. view the preview and customize the range of your needs before you scan the image with the button. the estimated file size will be shown in the right, lower corner.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure that the window is completely displayed, as some settings may not be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="778">After pressing the button Scan, you need to wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the options of the target image appears. please remember that type BMP does not compress and therefore produces very large files. you also need to select or create the folder & # 160; select or create the image to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="779">You can create screenshots after you have selected in the menu Importation &gt; Screen Photo... a window appears in which you can set the different screen photomodi:</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management on the Internet. Flickr makes it possible to send photos to people who are important. you can show your favorite photos of the world, put photos of your camera mobile online and show your photos secure and private to your friends and family all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The exporting module to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time, you will be guided through the process of creating a token. this will be used for your authentication. so it is virtually your ID to Flickr. a browser is started so that you can log in to Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After the successful registration, the module can send photos to Flickr website.You will be presented the following page after a successful registration.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after pressing Yes, you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">If the exporting module is started to Flickr for the second time, you will be greeted with the following dialog, which displays the current access permissions that the module displays. at the moment, you don't need any other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button photos should be pressed once after you have set all the other options. with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. pressing the Ok button starts the upload of the photos to Flickr server.</seg>
<seg id="803">The keywords field can be filled with a comma-separated list of words. these are added to the image as keywords during the upload process.</seg>
<seg id="804">With the options Public, Friends, and Familly, you can adjust the permissions to your images. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you change the option Modify the size of the photos before uploading, the photos will be changed before uploading in size. the size is taken from the value entered at maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images. the size is changed in such a way that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>
<seg id="807">The KIPI module gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server</seg>
<seg id="808">The KIPI module Galerie-Export has no documentation at this time. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographical localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographic data is stored in the EXIF keywords of the image and the location can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographical localization provides tools for locating images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, longitude and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your pictures with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in the gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical Localization Correlator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and invoke the menu. the above-to-see dialog appears. to perform a possible correlation over time and localization, you need to load a trace file with GPX file. this file naturally contains data that were taken at the same locations as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed which indicates the coordinates in red. GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera period must be converted with the GMT. this can be done with the time zone. set your camera time here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for maximum time variance gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera period. if the deviation is included, the data will be merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no trace data of a place for pictures you can edit the gpx file manually and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will correlate all the images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolating and difference in minutes can be used if you don't have the right data. if you know that in reality a location is in a great time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlate to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful when you have made a number of photos at the same location. since the dialog opens the coordinates of one call to the next, you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the displayed map. select the region concerned and enlarge sie.Run this time and again until you have reached sufficient accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the card can be changed between map mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the images. here is a small script that uses the exifttool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module gallery is a tool for exporting a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a photo gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that should be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 in order to enable the best internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The tab has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted. the tab Select allows to select all albums that should be exported to HTML. the albums are not displayed hierarchically. with the three buttons on the right side, you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the Albenvorschau and the text that appear in the header of the HTML page will appear.</seg>
<seg id="824">The rider appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this tab is largely self-explanatory. the option To create a page for each image creates a gallery in which each image also gets its own page. if you then click on a picture, a new page is displayed in which the image is displayed. otherwise the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer, & eg; Kuickshow</seg>
<seg id="825">The tab album defines the settings where and how to save the gallery with all your associated images. to do so, select a folder on which you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLexport, which contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With Other color depth, you can change the default color depth. of course, this also affects the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">"" "the tab" "" "thumbnails" "" "allows you to adjust some of the settings from the Album tab for thumbnails, which are small images to be displayed in the gallery." ""</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window displays the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the program messages to see if errors occurred during creation. the web browser will automatically be started at the end to preview the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations like turning, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons. it has been developed for quick picture display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture will appear in full screen mode by default. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless module is a tool for changing pictures without compromising your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions listed below, without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of lossless storage is that the file size increases since there is no compression of the color information. this can be found e.g. with the PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera clip is a tool for connecting your computer to a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module DigitalCamera-Klient currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the kde-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. to do so, select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image, i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not write in any target format. JPEG is supported when writing. please refer to exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodiver module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodiver module can be used to convert selected images into an MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages. you can also add a base image transition between the individual images. you can also add an audio file to the MP2 or WAV of the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. additionally, you can select a background color for slide show. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. finally, you can use the K3b program to burn the medium.</seg>
<seg id="845">You first need to select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG Slideshow. then you can create the module via Tools MPEG Slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you have selected are then listed in the Portfolio catalog files. there you can also change the sorting of the images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you are planning to play the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV Standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds that an image is displayed. the speed of the image transition is defined below. a low value creates very sudden, but very smooth image changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should leave it black. you can set the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG output file. keep as fast as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file in the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. once you have adjusted all settings to your wishes, you can start the creation of the movie using the Code button. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now go for a coffee and enjoy the slide show if you are back again.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a critic appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can customize the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages via the Settings right bottom.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper along with standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the Image Processing Gimp. this is e.g. useful to improve or print the Gimp module directly.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw of Dave Coffin. an original quote from him is: do not expect dcraw to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file to be converted and run the module. the Raw image converter window appears in the mode for a single image. with the Preview button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness, and red / blue amps can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal you can edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-color RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you're happy with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename remains the same and only the extension is adapted accordingly. JPEG uses a loss-based algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it.</seg>
<seg id="859">The tagged image format, TIFF, retains all the information of your image and uses lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you intend to edit your images frequently, or later otherwise use them further, you should not choose the JPEG format, since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion with the Run button. if you want to break this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch processing mode allows you to convert several images at once. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, they have the possibility to override existing files automatically. this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar indicates how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the start number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can make the image smaller or enlarge.</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio remains unchanged. for example, you can use this option to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: disproportionate size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Print preparation: prepares the image for the photo print. the user can set the print resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, will be adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you started the module, the image window will be displayed with the images you have selected. you can add more images via the button images. for the last selected image, a preview will be displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images to the picture list and place them there to add them to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">The button images remove the selected images from the list of the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the images you can open the New Message window of your email client with the OK button. you only need to add the addresses and the subject here. the pictures you have selected are attached as attachments.</seg>
<seg id="877">Don't mind sending too many pictures at once. most e-mail accounts have restrictions on the size of sending emails. it might be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your email client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you must first install the Gmail agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in a attached file, the comments to the images are added to a text file and added to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the View menu file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. therefore, you should use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="883">When you select JPEG files in JPEG format and the original files are in JPEG format, the original ExifData will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be closed automatically so that you can view the status messages on the search for errors. however, your e-mail program will be started automatically at the end. with the button Close, you can close this window.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Diaschau a window with questions like you want to have displayed your slide show appears. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL-transitions option in the presentation activates very elegant image transitions by OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">"" "the" "" "Show file name" "" "option ensures that the filename of the images is displayed in the lower left corner of the presentation." ""</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop allows the presentation to be displayed in an endless loop. you can then manually cancel it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images randomly select makes the images appear in a random order. so it is not used the order of the pictures in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The time interval between the images can be set between the images. 1500 milliseconds are 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect. so you should test it before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are over a dozen transition effects between which you can select. by chance, each transition between the images selects a different effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide show you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen. move the mouse in this corner to turn on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and the next image and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">On the left lower screen edge you can see the current file name, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module Time & Date now has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool for setting an image as a background image for the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module displays the currently selected image, depending on the selected submenu option, as background for your KDE worksurface.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have annotated your pictures and videos with comments, you can with & kphotoalbum; by these browses, see picture. as you can see by a comparison with the image, are now available in each group, i.e. in people, places and in group keywords entries.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window, you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have annotated your pictures and videos. in addition, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current preview images.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse on the entry, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person only the pictures on which both people are shown. through this selection method you can restrict the number of displayed images from a few thousand images to a few single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all persons, locations and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view the images of your sphere of activity.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name. you can record with & kphotoalbum; however, for each person to store a separate preview picture, this also applies to places, keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself. see also the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the name, select the button located on the right-side of the toolbar. in the pop-up context menu, you can select which view you want to use for each category separately. this has the advantage that you can display symbols with pictures of people and a list of keywords (if you don't have suitable pictures for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must decide for yourself which image should be displayed for each individual person. to do this, you need to open the Image Viewpoint window (described in more detail) and in the context menu select the entry categories editor. in the View window, you can customize the magnification factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be viewed and / or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you visit the search entry in the main window, a dialog is displayed that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can view this dialog on the image again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string of characters in the caption or description field, the captions or descriptions of the images will be searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to search for; the date can either be a part of the total date, e.g. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use an area of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom of the window, you can search all images by specific names as you can see in the picture. here, pictures on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum;. if you don't like reading manuals, but prefer to try out functions like this, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kPhotoalbum; and watch the quick entry, the screenshots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kPhotoalbum; and select in the first dialog the demo, if you start & kPhotoalbum; for the first time, or select the menu entry kphotoalbum; demo. thereupon some sample pictures are loaded and you can try the features of & kphotoalbum;</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you can find it on the Homepage of & kPhotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar see here:. as the name says, this bar displays you data statistics on the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can display several different time units. each bar then displays a different unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying the bar only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed preview view from the database (if you select a date, the first image of this date will appear in the preview pane) and the timeline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images if you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select an area of the timeline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time data. if you select an area, you will only see images of this period in the preview view. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you two ways to create HTML websites with your pictures. the one is in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other available as module (see). in the following part of the user manual is described in & kphotoalbum; integrated version that you can create via the File HTML... menu.</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas: content, Layout and Goal. in the following, each section is described in more detail.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the review and a description that the HTML file should contain later. on kphotoalbum; HTML example pages see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & kPhotoalbum; export file should be created which is to be seen on the overview page.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can choose which information to display on the HTML pages. therefore, you can avoid displaying information that is obvious to the viewer without description. note that & kphotoalbum; at the moment all images are exported. therefore, you cannot use this setting to hide specific images from particular viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how the HTML pages are to look like. most settings are unique, which is why they are not specifically addressed to them.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. this means that those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 cannot download images which, for example, have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you specified. so, it can browse your images with low resolution, leading to a smaller transmission time. if you want to get an image larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting range, you specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">The best choice for all your HTML files is a basic folder and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder where all your pictures are saved. this folder is saved and added automatically next time. this allows you to select the location for all future images. here you can either select a folder or a log supported by KDE, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">Once you have created your images, you can check if these are really all visible to viewers. if you choose a URL for the base folder, a web browser will start after the pages have been created. the URL you set here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files you create aren't yet in the final destination folder, you have to manually copy them there. to enable the import function, see, properly you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings that are just described have all been related to basic folders and URLs. in these settings, a subfolder will be created, whose name will be specified in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; coming together, you may want to create your pictures with these. however, if you have spent a lot of time applying the image information, persons on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you have to do with & kphotoalbum; this work does not even do this.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kPhotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images into a .kin file. these can import others into your database. the image properties are imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if there is only one link to images in the file. the advantage of saving all images in the file is that you can have all the pictures together and pass this file as independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can export a .kin file directly from the File Export... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kin file along with an HTML file, this will be an external .kin file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file scans the images in two ways. first, it searches the images found in the .kim file folder. if the corresponding pictures are not found, then the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following describes the dialog for exporting images that you can view from the Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. there are three choices available:</seg>
<seg id="938">In the manual copy option to close the .kim file, you have to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically to copy Automatically close the .kim file copy & photoalbum; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most of the images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is not normally worthwhile to compress the files. if you want this anyway, simply select the Export File option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the pictures in full size as the .kin file would otherwise be very large. for example, you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the Import menu... select & kPhotoalbum; import the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard for import consists of four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import, then to which folders to import the images to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category of persons of the file to be imported (if you are a domain), while this category is called persons in your database. therefore, in the third dialog box you will be asked which categories of the file to import to import, and which categories these are in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. for example, see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and view images: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump inside of different picture groups & mdash; for example, if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover an image with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will pass the various steps of (1) Designating the information about your images, via (2) browsing and viewing, up to (3) advanced themes and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum has started as a program to manage your images, but it has been expanded and today your videos are also taken care of. in many places in this manual you talk about images, but often this also includes videos.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kPhotoalbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the top folder of your images. this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, to a floppy or revisions in CVS, where you want them.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kPhotoalbum; records the folder where your images are stored and will automatically reuse it in future releases. if you want to read another database in & kphotoalbum; so you can start a different folder tree with pictures, you can start with the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / Company / Pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry settings kphotoalbum; set up... you get to a window with which you can modify the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the User Manual, you will be able to explain the different settings.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols that allow you to view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can call to the F1 key and a click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can define different properties for each image, for example people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog that is used to edit already existing groups. for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">Subcategories have already been mentioned in the Options section. in the Options dialog, you can set up complete members, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a Medifan as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the list of preferences you can select the category you want to configure. in the left part of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; splits its modular system with other graphic applications such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called via the menu modules. the modules can and will not be described in this manual, as they are not part of & kphotoalbum; they are, but separately sold. however, most of the modules have a help page that you can call through the modules themselves.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used by several applications together, it may be that the modules have been tested with & kphotoalbum; therefore, you should always test new modules first with the demo database before using them on your own pictures. demo database can be either via the command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu. don't say I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that the modules use over KIPI are very different, making it possible that some modules with & kphotoalbum; do not work. this is the disadvantage when you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications can arrange their pictures into albums: this is an album simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this type of order does not support, it simulates for some modules the order after albums so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum;</seg>
<seg id="962">It simulates & kPhotoalbum; the current album, which simply corresponds to the current view, so all the images that show you the picture preview right now.</seg>
<seg id="963">Apart from the current album & kphotoalbum; the modules also have a list of albums. here & kPhotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s Browser shows the content of a category, for example all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you set in preferences as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you use the category people, & kphotoalbum; so do so whether you have selected people to view and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. to do so, start the settings dialog and select the modules to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you will see an example of a start screen as soon as you start & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used to by any other KDE application, you will see a menu and toolbar at the top. under the toolbar, you will see the window with which you have entered your image database. in the section we will return to this window, but now click on the pictures to show you an overview of all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to comment any picture with notes. this includes information about the people who are shown on the picture, where the picture has been taken, etc. you can set each image individually or for a larger number of pictures simultaneously. if for example on all pictures Jesper is depicted and all pictures taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these comments if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view you can see three lists with a text box by setting persons, locations and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; since you will always use them whenever you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on postponing the images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons are depicted, you can, by the fact that the names used are moved up to find and assign persons more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to see an alphabetically sorted list, click on the icon for sorting by date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected annotations for each image individually, you may want to edit all the selected images and add these images with notes. in this case, simply click on the above and back buttons that are located at the top right below the preview of the image.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have recorded several images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and to use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. also, San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as a supergroup. in order to show you that it is a over-group, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the Notation dialog it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new subcategory or subcategory. additionally, you can simply drag an entry to a category and place it in order to make it a sub-category of this entry.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the single elements of the annotation dialog by clicking and moving the bar that form the upper edge of the box. you can also make a separate window from a frame by moving it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adjusted the look of the window so to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the Options button, which among other things offers you the possibility to save the current layout and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can leave a frame completely hidden. if you want to see this window again later, use the Options button... and then hide / hide windows. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the images in the browser, you will get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected images, or all images if you have not set a filter. an example of this can be seen here. you can configure the thumbnails size by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button. try it again.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image is set up as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">If you click on a picture, it will be displayed in the image viewer. if you have not opened a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the image preview. simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and press either the removal key or select Delete from the Edit menu. now the window will show you that you can see in the image.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use with & kphotoalbum; namely, images without you saved on the hard drive. of course you need to have the images somewhere saved with that & kphotoalbum; you can view the view from & kphotoalbum; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures in which the upper right corner is cut are not saved on the hard disk. however, for the pictures 5-9 the thumbnails are present, so that & kphotoalbum; you can't view these images with the picture viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see, this feature requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them back again. & kphotoalbum; don't support it up to now to insert the CD concerned. so if you want to avoid trouble on how to avoid the confusion of your images, please buy a larger hard drive to save all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the pictures menu, you will find a submenu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the pictures so that at the end those who want to make you inaccessible to others and click on current view lock in the menu privacy. alternatively, you can also control all the pictures your little sister can see and lock the menu item Anything except current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">This allows you to specify which images should be hidden in the case of the case. if you give the laptop to your little sister, just select the menu entry to lock pictures, so that all the images you have locked are hidden. if you want to get the pictures again displayed click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to set a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select your password in the privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure. on the one hand, all pictures on the hard disk and on the other hand can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection is only used to repel those who are with & kphotoalbum; not very familiar to repel the view to private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you want to spend all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours with it is of course that you want to consider them someday. for this reason & kphotoalbum; via a picture _ and video viewer.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see in. it obviously shows the picture, but additional all the information you have entered through the picture, e.g. who is on the picture, when and where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If you want to see the info box on the upper part of the image you want to see, you can simply drag it with the mouse and place somewhere else. you can also configure what information is displayed and whether information is displayed at all. all of these options are available right click on the viewer. the then pop-up context menu can be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="996">If you click on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have several images loaded in the viewer, you can switch between them before and after by using the buttons image up and down. you can jump to the first and last image with Pos1 and the end. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several images are loaded in the viewer, you can run it as slide show. & kphotoalbum; then loads a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of the viewer of & kphotoalbum; it is possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode the viewer uses the complete place on the screen. simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can zoom in and zoom into the image. to zoom in, you can simply drag a rectangle with the mouse. with the minus key, you can zoom in again. shows how a zoom rectangle is selected and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. using the magic button sets the zooms so that each pixel on the screen matches a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work in videos that enter and zoom in with the plus and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the rotation functions from the context menu, you can turn the image. this does not work for videos. you can make notes on the current image using the menu item Notices from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures it can happen that you find an image with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture. at the moment you can view this and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter these names. you will perhaps prefer to mark only the image and view more images.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see which photos you want, you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while watching one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer has the possibility to display images with features while you view them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter. in view you can see a picture in which the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your pictures, these can be viewed in your browser. so, if you print all the images you edit, print or whatever you have selected, then you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in preview view. if you view categories in the particular preview view, you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case, you are allowed & kphotoalbum; to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The mixture is not saved with the image, but in the database. in this way you can undo your painted one later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In, you can see a picture on which it was painted. to turn on the painting mode of & kphotoalbum; on the image, select on the image from the context menu. to end the painting simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you need to use the application of the program & Povray; not fully proficient, but the documentation to & Povray; should you absolutely read and understand.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wireformat views.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the object of an object that is already selected, since all objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click either the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu is displayed, so that you can select the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">You can either delete selected objects from the scene with deleting from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to assume these changes. if you entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with an error description. then you can correct the input errors and click on the user or discard the changes with Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; -References to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. as default, the entire texture will be rendered even if you want to render a part of the texture (for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map), check the box locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screen shot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these checkpoints with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the checkpoints disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse within the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a Visibility level as a wire model. you can indicate this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher-level object or as absolute value. objects will only be displayed when they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the level of visibility chosen in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window layout, or if you need a different layout, you can set it at will. you can also save multiple window orders and simply switch between different configurations.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window over or under a view, drag the beginning to the upper or lower edge of a view. a rectangle then displays the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the starter to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other, drag the starter in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map tab at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from the anchorage, drag the infant to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left in the chamfer strip.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the chamfer strip. to prevent the closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the View menu, you will find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any location.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The actual window view can be saved with view window layout... Save. a dialog appears where you can save the window layout under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you created a scene, you can render it render. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g to render, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click the Rendering symbol Rendering in the toolbar or select View Scene menu item.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode matches the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and the quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many render modes as you like from a quick preview to full-quality images.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click the render settings icon in the toolbar or select Render modes in the View menu, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it makes sense a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map tab size, you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the section subsection and enter the image cut to render into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination field quality, you can select the properties that are used for rendering. this works from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuse reflection light. a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User's Guide to & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If an image is rendered with just one ray per pixel, different errors can occur. these images often have a Moirè pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel in the representation. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. generally, pictures with this feature are better off.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn on anti-aliasing, it calculates and connects & Povray; more than a beam per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as a standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling involves the neighboring pixels. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively because each pixel is repeatedly divided and adaptive because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray tracks a beam per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixel exceeds the default threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a specific additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a lattice of 5 then 5x5 (25) will be charged extra beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference then is:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Activities in the United States (R 1 -r 2) + abs (1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels that are individually followed and tested for further subdivisions. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another possibility to reduce the aliasing effect is the production of noise for the ray process called Jittering. if you turn on Jittering, change & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection is calculated. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can specify whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the corresponding beams have not hit an object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly finished, you can find the reason for this here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; scene to import, select the menu entry file Import... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not yet the complete command range of & Povray;. if error messages or warnings occur when importing, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import this source text between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this inserts the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor. to import objects to the scene simply select the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can insert source code for & Povray; also.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovray; a scene renders. usually, this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on Help in the property view, opens & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; User documentation for the displayed object. set the path to your documentation and the version here. supported are 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; looking for external files (for example height field data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you must also enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used to display the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type number plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects like e.g. the ball you can set the detail level separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you check high detail fidelity for extended projections, all wire model views are further subdivided if the camera uses an extended projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections. this feature gives a better approach for projections, but requires more time to render.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you view a wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is displayed in a checkerboard pattern made of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the floor, a floor below the objects is rendered. the floor is displayed in a checkerboard pattern made of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you check box smoothing, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold value. more details on the parameters can be found in the Render-Modi section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page, you can modify existing window orders or create new window orders. in the window orders section it is explained how to create and store window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The Combination field Standard window arrangement: displays all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of window orders present shows all existing window orders. a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement using the Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement. new views can be created with the Add button and selected views with the Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">With New column, you create a new column on the right of the existing windows, with ounds you anchor the window under the existing window, with flashcard you get a map-map view together with the previous view and floating, the view does not appear in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without a more precise knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a sphere at a level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should observe these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules can be applied to rendering, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't insert light sources, your entire scene is in the dark and you will only get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything error-free, you will see at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following preset window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing toolbar icons. please read the documentation so that you get an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols frequently, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, first you need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the Edit Delete menu.</seg>
<seg id="1085">This is the view of the scene from the camera's point of view. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the content of the view object properties in which the various parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation to & Povray; find more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera. simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you press the button Apply or the Enter key, the wiremodel views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, you will see the scene from the camera's point of view.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. for example, you could insert a Quader (insert infinite body Quader) and adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a complicated method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually provides a simpler option. you can use an infinite plane as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the user button or enter the enter key. in the object tree the new name will be immediately displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now also displays the level, even at the moment only as a limited final level. when you render the scene, the plane expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look closely at the object tree, you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor if you click on the symbol + in front of the object. in this case, you will only find the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation, and shifting. select one of these options, change also the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the soil to the horizontal line for the exercise, just to get to know some of these parameters. select shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but at the moment choose something simple.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog opens in which you can select how to insert the object. please select first subproperty. the pigment is then displayed in the property view (Name = Ground-Pigment), with a click on the button Preview you will see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigment only shows a matte black material because you still need to enter settings for the pigment. therefore always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview. also, there are many options again, but now take the easiest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see any color on the Quader and Ball in the preview, just click on the Apply button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you are rendering your picture now with a click on the symbol, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">In the color list you need to enter two new attributes, called one-colored. in the color list you need to enter two new attributes. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more frequently, but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, select one color each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should be able to do this step simply because you should have already understood the basic principles of & kpovmodeler; the sphere can be created just as easily as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget to press the Enter key or Apply button), so the ball has contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball would float above the ground as you have moved the base to one unit down.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, rendering is now a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface appears like a matte black material. in the next step, put a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have chosen the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as already on the ground, give the sphere a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select the first subproperty and change the name for example in sphere pigment. click on ball Pigment, then select Ino and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish features:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screenshots and click Apply or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The brightness-effect and reflection options already result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metal: not even selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good idea of the possibilities offered to you & kpovmodeler; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracytracing is a render method to create a two dimensional image of a three dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you raytracing a scene, the renderer shoots out hypothetical rays from the viewer's perspective (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) by each pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this beam is reflected by the objects and how atmospheric effects such as fog effect.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you view the scene. without a light source you also don't see anything, the picture is just black. obviously, every scene that is to be rendered requires some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog, you can select a file that you created previously with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you already saved the model, it will be saved under the same name. if it is a new file, you will need to enter a name and a disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Recovers the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage will be discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the recently undone command. this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit Contracts.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Stores the current window layout and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing layout.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, keyboard shortcuts and standard behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog for changing the keyboard shortcuts. you can add pre-set short commands for & kpovmodeler; change commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up the toolbar. you can use this option to add and remove tool symbols for & kpovmodeler; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model every diffuser on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for both a dump map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis by applying an image file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& Dickshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & ball show; is very easy. the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking on the & LMBs; or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can specify whether each image should be displayed in a separate window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, just type the first character of the filename in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the right lower corner. if a suitable filename is found, the file will be highlighted. you can exit the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general functions that are mostly found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browsers, players, playlists, playlist browsers and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and & kde; additionally, Amarok has some own command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a reply if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script if all required modules are present and use kdialogue so that the user knows why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Corundum' Rescue LoadError error = 'Corundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebinding v3.4 is required for this script.' 'kdialogue --sorry' # {error} '' exit end</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command; which should be enclosed in any KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow executing external programs and commands. to do this, the exec () function is mostly used. in this way dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends alerts to all running scripts. for this, strings are written to the standard input of the script. for this reason, scripts should continuously monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script can also ignore events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Send the script to display the setup dialog. to save and load the setup data, each script must take care of itself. if a script is started, Amarok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange Indicates that a new piece is being played. the script could now and zb; with DCOP functions more information about the new track may query (for example, the metadata or the length of the piece).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume Change defines a change in volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle paths Contains the path to the selected files of the playlist when a custom menu item is clicked. submenu and itemTitle are also passed to allow the script to identify the clicked entry. to remove an entry you can use dcop Amarok script removeCustommenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; exit, or when the user stops a script, send & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to do, for example, storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script administration can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar) which can optionally be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2).</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with an extended amarokscript. for this reason, you should rename your script packages right.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file permissions:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can upload it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki scripts page of & Amarok; for your record on kde-apps you should use the category Amarok; scripts.</seg>

<seg id="1218">To keep the current piece visible when changing the piece, the playlist window will pop up / off to keep the each running piece in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">When changing to context browser, the context browser automatically switches to the context browser as soon as the next piece is played.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section you can customize & Amarok's appearance. the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the fonts section you can set the use of various fonts in & Amarok; use the otherwise gray outlined section. you can select fonts for the following area: playlist windows, player windows and context browsers. press Select..., so you can select a font from the selection dialog.</seg>

<seg id="1232">Recursively Browse subfolders: this causes & Amarok; both the ticked and their subfolders will be searched for music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitor changes: allows & Amarok; to monitor the selected folders on changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). in addition, an incremental search is carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import Playlists: causes & Amarok to add all found playlists to your collection folder (.pl- and .m3u files) to your collection. the automatically added playlists will then appear in the playlist's browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The collection database is used to select a database for the collection. the combination field driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further setup is required in the MySql subwindow.</seg>

<seg id="1241">Get similar interpreters: after activating this setting & Amarok, get a list with similar interpreters to the played piece. note: you can view the list in the context browser. note: you do not need a last.fm profile to use this function.</seg>
<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (such as & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the package kdelibs and no other KDE packages. you need to have kdelibs installed (including the programs included, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts).</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions, such as the OSD, require that your window manager keep the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. for example, Gnome will work, but fluxbox will help for instance. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt as these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably one of your files will make a mistake in the TagLib library. you can locate the file by clicking in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this bug to the TagLib developer at bugs.kde.org and also append the broken file that caused the crash.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Mostly this is because taglib crashes when reading the meta information from this file. please report this bug to the TagLib developer at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for it in & Amarok; is a bit more sophisticated.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all of the libraries used by & Amarok were compiled with the same compiler version. if, for example, & Amarok; with GCC 3.4, TagLib was compiled with GCC 3.3.X, then this leads to crashes when editing the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you are using KDE with artsd, disable automatically when inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least do not use a value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by e-mail (the e-mail automatically opens with a crash). if this is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error is guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data in the meta-information as UTF-8 but do not mark them as Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the "$ARGV [0]; use MP3:: Mplib; my $mp3 = MP3:: Mplib; my $mp3 = MP3:: Mplib; $ARGV [0]\" unless $MP3- &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>

<seg id="1255">If you get this error: amarokapp: symbol lookup error: amarokapp: undefined symbol: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setpixmapERK7Qpixmap, then check if Amarok is using the correct Qt library. this can be seen with ldd'which amarokapp '_ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this error, you may need to remove any colliding Qt version or modify / etc / ld.so.conf so that Amarok find the correct version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">There are some possibilities. most installation problems are most easily solved by the help of an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search for help with other users or developers. use the forum and the IRC under irc.freenode.net in the channel # Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugzilla is not suitable to search for help. please only make a mistake there if something is related to the fix of an error in Amarok itself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & Amarok, only an empty playlist appears. how will there be pieces of music there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is easy. use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">In order to keep the surface intuitively, the start window has been converted to the statistic window. you will find it under Extras statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars stand for rating by the user, while the points are automatically calculated.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To rate pieces, the rating column must be displayed in the playlist. click on the title bar of the playlist and select column show valuation. click anywhere in the new application column to specify the rating for a piece. you can also use the short commands Windows + [1-5]. this also works if Amarok is in the background.</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the Alsa sink, the device must provide a blender. a mixer enables several applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously stream audio. this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer (e.g. SBLive) or through the dmix module for Alsa (Software-Mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and a solution. for GStreamer, you may need to specify a different sink (e.g. osssink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">Do not forget that media must first be decoded. you can't just send an MP3 to ALSA, you only want to hear a white noise. GStreamer is the best choice for most people if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead. GStreamer reads the file, decodes it and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">XMMS also decodes the data first. GStreamer can output directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. enable sound servers with the highest possible priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of the sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure artswrapper SUID is set:</seg>
<seg id="1277">With KDE 3.2.x, there are problems with KDEMultimedia codecs that can cause disturbed playback. read this error report. enlarging the sound buffer in your ALSA setup file .asoundrc can also help.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Either you do not use the Arts driver, but instead GStreamer or xine, or install KDE multimedia complete to get the faster Arts codecs (libarts _ mpeglib.so & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="1279">Probably use the Arts driver. use another driver (the xine driver was strongly optimized for Analyzer), or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the Control Centre and Sound & Multimedia, Sound System.</seg>
<seg id="1280">GStreamer is installed, but if I want to change to the GStreamer driver, crashes & Amarok; off. why?</seg>
<seg id="1281">Once you have installed GStreamer, you need to register all of the components. execute a register to register all the GStreamer components.</seg>
<seg id="1282">Read the GStreamer FAQ. if that doesn't help, you can also ask for the IRC channel # GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="1283">Try this (finish Amarok before!): - Download ffmpeg, compile and install it. then run all ffmpeg files in the module folder of GStreamer (you will find the module folder with the most recent config / GStreamer-config) and run the log-register again. start now & Amarok;.</seg>

<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variants at will. example: Mike Oldfield OR scores: &gt; 50 -comment: bathroom. this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield, or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bath.</seg>

<seg id="1462">If you call this entry, you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog. it has the same effect as if you view the files directly from the top view into the project view. if the current project is a data CD, the files added will appear in the basic folder of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1463">This dialog is basically the same as the Project Properties dialog. the only difference is the additional button burning, the & k3b; for burning the medium. the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data.</seg>
<seg id="1464">Open the properties dialog for the current project. here you can make many project related settings. each project type has different possible settings, most of which are described via the What is the? -Remove (accessible via the right mouse button).</seg>
<seg id="1465">This entry will only appear with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. it causes & k3b to import files from an previous session into the current project. this is useful when using files for a multiple session CD. it is rather intended for you rather than help so that you can see the files and folders that already exist on the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1466">This entry will only appear with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. this feature causes & k3b; to remove imported files from the current project. all other files will remain in the project.</seg>
<seg id="1467">This also allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file. alternatively, you can also create an image from a CD which you can burn later on. you should also prefer cloning instead of the normal copy. you should prefer cloning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">This also allows to copy DVD to another medium without a project file. alternatively, you can also create an image from a DVD that you can burn later. furthermore, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of the normal copy. furthermore, the target medium must be large enough to accommodate the entire (video) data of the source medium in the original form.</seg>
<seg id="1469">To delete a CD-RW, you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD-RW.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This dialog allows you to format a DVD ± R (W), which completely deletes the contents. & k3b; lets you choose between the writing modes overwriting and incremental.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Burn a previously created CD image. the dialog asks you for a * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file as a data source, which can then be burned immediately by pressing the Burn button. (Nero * .nrg files are currently not supported, therefore you need to use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">Burns a previously created DVD image. the dialog asks you for a * .iso file as a data source, which can then be burned immediately by pressing the Burn button.</seg>
<seg id="1473">A previously used DVD video can be converted. this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view, but can also be used as a standalone. it contains information about the selected video, encoding settings, and even possibilities for changing the size and trimming black edges.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Displays information about the inserted media. this information is displayed in the content view and contains the properties of the medium, such as the size and title length of the CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Shows a list of toolbars of & k3b; when an entry is enabled, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">If this is enabled, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not checked, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The folder view contains an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives. if the content view is enabled, its contents will be displayed in the content view. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info, locking and blocking of the drive or eject the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The content view allows you to select and drag files into the project view. the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The header is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the header has no real function, it looks pretty and separates the projector view clearly from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog box to change the key assignments for & k3b; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part, you can adjust the key assignment further down.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This starts the k3b; setup wizard. this allows the correct authorizations to be set for burning CDs and DVDs. therefore, system administrator rights are required, so you need to enter the password for the system administrator (root) when the wizard is started.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Open the settings of & k3b; here general application settings can be done. almost all functions of & k3b; should work straight away. this dialog is intended for personalizing and fine adjustment of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; applications also, equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script, for example.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the DCOP functions, you can either use the dcop command line program, or the slightly more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the range of functions, so your taste and the type of your task will be decisive.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you use the dcop command line program. to use the & DCOP, you must make sure that & k3b; started. then enter something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP; functions that all & kde; program have in common, supported & k3b; mainly two other parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; provides features such as copyCD, format DVD and other functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">Projects () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () void burnCdImage () void burnCdImage () void burnCdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createxProject method one gets a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bproject-0) Alternatively, a project can be created via the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project received via # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject. using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above listed K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which can only be used on data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (Qstring name) void createFolder (Qstring name, Qstring Transparent) void removeItem (Qstring path) void renameItem (Qstring path) void renameItem (Qstring path, Qstring newName) void setVolume (Qstring id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders, and then adds files to the new folders:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3binterface createDataCDproject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT addurl / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; -reader for & kde;. with it can easily be read audio CD; s can be read and stored in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are also possible depending on encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudioCreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; files in WAV files on hard disk) and from many encoders that encode these WAV files (these encoders must still be installed from the Linux distribution). other encoders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the title of the & CD; read out and saved in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these wav files (usually one per caption) are compressed into the MP3- or OGG format or also in other formats such as the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, it needs to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders must be installed. all these programs are usually already existing for any Linux distributions, so it is very likely not necessary to compile anything themselves. if, for example, FLAC is not used, its installation is also not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format should be used? the chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction about encoders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as I said, & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia to read the audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to crack any copy protection. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device handles the protection, it is not possible to read a protected audio CD; just avoid the purchase of copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only once has to be done (the setup dialog can be called up so often until a suitable configuration is found), the daily handling of reading a & CD; explained to the hard drive. this (hopefully) leads to the understanding of the slim approach of the user interface, which you will often stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which encoder programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; collect information from the freedb from the internet or work completely without a network, where everything is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the main window commands. step by step for example, you will find more information on how to use this program as well as screenshots with descriptions of the tabs for configuring the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Starts the CDDB enquiry of CD data according to the setup of request in the CDDB. (this can be local or online, in the latter case first the connection to the Internet must be established.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Starts reading and - if an encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup guide - encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoders so that the selection can be read with a different encoder as the default. note that previously, the encoding settings in the encoding settings have been configured in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager so that an already selected file is selected for encoding instead of a complete & CD; read and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notifications (such as protocols, beeps) for program events (such as reading the & CD; exit).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main home decor dialog by & kaudiocreator; with different flashcards (like Encoder, to set up the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoders and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a loss-free audio format is required. besides FLAC there are also others like 'shorten' or 'monkey', which may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression ratios and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but over this bit rate, the differences become less important as both encoders generate very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O 'not so' free, lame is supplied with most distributions for free, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (at high bit rates), but compared with OGG slightly deeper quality at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer-based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playback devices is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special auto stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of audio quality parameters and the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. always needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a song. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression ratio approx. 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a song. good enough for music by teenagers, portable devices and autostereos. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you want absolutely the highest quality regardless of the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is entered manually or automatically retrieved from the freedb over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / use with & kaudiocreator; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD title to the keywords (English: tag) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator; added. the result looks like '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download information instead of entering the computer. note that only text is spoken here: & CD; Titles, artists, names of the pieces, etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note of the translator) am not lawyer. however, no one can prevent that you from the & CD; publish information publicly available on the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is actively a check box to select (sending an address). for use of freedb can be used with another (fake) address than the one installed in the system. in this type of configuration, it seems, the e-mail address is not used when calling the data from the server (This may only know the programmer who checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server should be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the computers.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to store tunes from the & CD; to save in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; if you want to know more exactly, search in the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the right distribution if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the read wav files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. the first opening contains predefined lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a loss-free compression for audio data) on the encoding tab. other encoders can be added on this tab itself.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed from the concerned linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also required for predefined encoders. more information about encoders is in the section Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder, you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD disk, the write and reading real, and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoder of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check the envelope of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we'll use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps in average and ID3V1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame installed on your computer. both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. for example, a suitable package for lame can be found with a search engine, as it is considered not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission (eg; by trying to copy something into it with the konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic set-up of & kaudiocreator; something that is probably only done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure for reading a & CD; which needs to be repeated for each read-out & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we define the encoders to be used for compression of the music (lame) as well as the resulting sound quality (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps).</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them every time you read a & CD; change once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the reading program so it can read the & CD; data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive exists, the effective device name can also be specified. if the drive can be accessed with other programs, then a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the entries of the device designations for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The Map General Settings. here is not much to do. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything will be left / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In case of incomplete information, select prompts so that you will be informed when data to create keyword (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; -settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and allow the & CD; data automatically downloaded from a freedb computer via the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the freedb server during reading the & CD, so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selector is simpler, if a & CD; record is found, immediately starts reading the & CD;. this is associated with low risk, if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can easily be changed. the directory and filename is changed with Konqueror- &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, keep in mind: if you want to manually enter everything manually, disable the selector fields and freedb will not be used. you can work with freedb locally in offline mode when you download the database before. however, this is over 620 MB big, consider this twice whether this is worth it. to make freedb in offline mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for invoking the & CD; information from freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the section about freedb. set everything as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we haven't downloaded the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to freedb.org and look for a mirror server in your area. on this path the load is distributed among the hosts. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work on the same level as the server, but as many firewalls bockdown the 8880 protocol by default, there may be more luck with the 80 protocol, because the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we do not want to send any data to the freedb server. the first check box should suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the / tmp directory exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of pieces at the same time: sorry, is there a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author does not know, therefore simply try himself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece: check this for the & CD; discard at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then / must the path / folder specified in which the WAV files are saved. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. don't forget this folder if you want to do something with the wav files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything as it is on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something must be smoothed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is sufficient for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting bit rate is average about 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression ratio is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the creation of tags to V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags may also be deleted if required. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & kde; in case of later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the complete path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoded wav files: with a dual core or quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine can be tried to encode more than one WAV file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music cleverly, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section describes how the process of reading the & CD; runs on the hard disk. we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, has been described in the previous section. first, a connection to the Internet is set up as we are comfortable and want to fetch data from the freedb. the process described in this section must be repeated for each read-out & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not yet freedb, the screenshots look a bit different from that for a & CD; with success of freedb collected data. therefore, you will learn the & CD; data to be entered manually instead of extracting them from the internet. comments will indicate the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Don't try to find the & CD, this example. it's a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not happened yet, now the & CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screenshot. this only when the & CD; as audio CD; can be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, check out the Questions and Answers section for help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD was successfully picked up by the freedb, all tracks are filled out and the name of the artist and the album is also displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; key for your & CD; a window will appear and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for automatic retrieval of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in dialog for the settings), you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button on the toolbar. if you don't have a local database, but fetch the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD-Editor - Input of the CD-data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Current Title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer needs to be entered in the input field 'Current Title' unless you have compiled a compilation of different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The comment field below may be used for individual comments per piece, the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Caution: after successfully retrieving data from the freedb, the CD-editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the screenshot below. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist's and album name (e.g. if all words start with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we use only ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment field. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least what & kaudiocreator; maximum allowed.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders or file formats. see the help section for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the outgoing CD; in this example, this is not important as we do not transmit the & CD data anyway. for more information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or rap for example are found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After selecting 'OK', go back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data, which we recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button on the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed above the parts list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that it has a check character before each line of a piece. only the titles that are marked as selected are read out. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece one or off. make sure all pieces are selected, or press the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">If the selection process is started by clicking on the selection button, this window appears to confirm. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the Tasks button to switch to the order window. it is located in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control orders. the first piece is just read on the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message will see if you try to work with a code that you haven't installed yet. pieces that have not been successfully encoded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we have typed here in the example. have you checked whether you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of reading the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3. this takes place reading and coding in parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding. the machine used with an AMD64 does not seem to have a problem with simultaneous reading and coding (but two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read while another piece is encoded and a third order placed in the queue of the coding. after the last piece is encoded, a small window is displayed with a message for a short time in the top left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudioCreator;, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">& kaudiocreator; used today within the & kde; CVS is part of the kdemultimedia package. if you are familiar with CVS, you can download an anonymous copy from there. however, most distributions contain already a pre-compiled package, as & kaudiocreator; part of an important & kde; package. if you read this, you probably already did it...</seg>
<seg id="1609">This section is aimed at people who compile from source files, and not for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help like the program can be adjusted to your needs once it is running, then the following is right for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls many different programs has many different settings. it is best to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings. it displays screenshots of the different flashcards of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, still reading? even if only the help menu was clicked after starting the program, without any clue as it should go on from this somehow empty screen (especially if there is no audio CD in the drive at the time of the program start), or from the unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it all about? whoever reads this has probably already started the program. it should look something like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no email. the author cannot keep this manual. it is intended as the first version for a manual to & kaudiocreator; whoever wants to add something useful or change it may do it. at least only after contacting with the author. and if you read this, he has left this section and therefore agrees with this proposal.</seg>
<seg id="1615">Strange if you managed to get the source file from & kde; SVN, then you don't need these information, but...</seg>
<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and karaoke game of & kde; and besides others, he also has some features with real-time graphics and karaoke-realtime highlighting of texts also some features that other & UNIX; -MIDI players do not have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so should work on all OSS and & kde systems; & kmid; also supports the & Linux; Ultrasound project driver needed for GUS cards. Alsa is included as soon as it supports a sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color, so it's easy to follow the track.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of the activity of any MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag and drop allowing you to drag and drop any MIDI file from one & konqueror; -windows to kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files (song events or text events). kmid automatically determines the process used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">If you & kde; when you finish playing a song, kmid will start again next time with the same song.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it will appear the usual file dialog with which help you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; drop windows into the & kmid; window. this also works with multiple songs simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the Play button in the toolbar, select "Play" from the menu item or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece will automatically start as soon as you move it to the & kmid; window. (with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played one after the other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">As soon as & kmid; play a piece, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and moving back and forth with the controller.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click the arrows left and right of the tempo gauge and change the playback speed. to get back the original tempo, double-click the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar appears as pressing the pause or selecting the menu entry Pause in the menu item, thus interrupts playback. press the space bar while no play is played, start & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two types in one piece of music. some pieces use text file, others use lyrics event and other both. some pieces do not have any lyrics at all: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid, you can set which events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically calculated, which uses a song, so you don't have to manually set it. so, if you want to enable automatic text output in the Settings menu, the karaoke text is automatically selected.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to specify an event type, select the Text Inputs and / or Love events from the Settings menu. the same function also has the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files which you summarize. these are played in series. this section shows how you can efficiently use collections.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you can find it in the collection under the item Organize.... Click on New and give the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking copy and then giving the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original one.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the desired number in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection includes all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When you leave the application, this collection is not saved. consider this if you add a lot of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, you have to be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the Add button. in turn, the file dialog appears, with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the setting Automatically add to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic add to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If automatic add to the collection is not enabled, when opening a piece, the temporary collection will be activated and emptied. this collection will then be added to the opened pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs will be played. if you select the series from the sub-menu of the menu collections, the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the drop-down list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select the Next song button, enter the next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To flip back a song, select the Previous portion button, select the Previous item from the menu item or press the arrow left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to be deleted and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, it does not matter as it is not saved when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers that are not General MIDI capability. in this case, the MIDI Map translates General MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the Change patch to Trumpet type, making a trumpet sound if you originally should play a piano.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have one sound card, you do not need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM equipment and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI maps, so you need to edit the appropriate file manually (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that stores all the necessary settings for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text id (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define Keymap "Name of Keymap..." END Define Keymap "Another Keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is used to indicate that a section begins (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail so that I can support in future versions of & kmid; support can be for devices that are not general MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section you will see how to display the patches of General MIDI to your specific keyboard. general usage looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the identity sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to put all the sounds that this instrument needs to play on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a gun (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60) that sounds similar to a gun. to do this, enter the following into the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 (bullet), it will take patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that the word "Drumming Patch" refers to a different percussion instrument (drum, cymbals, maracas, etc;), and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards have).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to specify sounds on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, just as its presence. so you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several key maps for each channel and instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to make sounds on the percussions channel. take a look at the provided Keymaps as an example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channel, just make it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is mapped to the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the Keymap is used with the name Name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events that attempt to change the patch on this channel will be ignored. in this case, patch x will always be used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The option ForcePatch can be useful for example to always use the percussions-patch on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio indicates in which ratio Pitch-Bender events are multiplied. so if a MIDI file sends a pitch Bender event with the value n, it is converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then passed on. the value 4096 is used to avoid decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM provides that a keyboard that gets a pitch Bender event with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, some keyboards will try to play two sounds up to an octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid; around.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. this can be found in the Settings menu, point MIDI Settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see which sounds are being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button lights no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (up to now) has two different views to display the played sounds. in the Settings menu, select Settings under the point of the channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so if you find e.g. a song is too fast to follow the lyrics, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how a piece of music needs to be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, etc. thus, the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, the speed, etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; that's because & kmid; compiled without AWE support. to eliminate the problem, you need to download and install a source distribution (e.g. from kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree to support & kmid; Drag & Drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all files and drag them to the & kmid; -windows.</seg>
<seg id="1688">By default, enable automatic add to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key on the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow the playback. to restore the standard speed, you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & kde; Desktop ein & konqueror; -Windows with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (when I play a MIDI file) or attached (if I want to play a karaoke file).</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you only want to quickly listen to a file without adding it to a collection, turn the Automatically Add to collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.Therm. first, you only want to play the first file. so, set the Automatically Add to collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! when I listen to these songs or see the postcard, that animates me to program on & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; Malaga (Spain). I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; Malaga. at the moment I am in the third year, so I don't have much leisure time for my hobbies but I still try to collect MIDI files, make music and prove sentences.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you just want to make me happy, send me an email: larpink @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">They make me really happy if you send me a postcard from your home or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all of them send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will count among friends of & kmid; but before you send a MIDI file, you should contact me, as I may already have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I've written & kmid; written entirely in my spare time and never got money from anyone for it. I would like to emphasize that I am only interested in programming, because / when I get feedback from users (post cards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch of AWE cards was too high.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks go to Jose Luis Sanchez for testing the AWE support, Ignacio Garcia for testing AWE support, Has Petter Bieker, Ola Sigurdson, Marc Diefenbruch, Peter Gritsch, Magnus Pepa, Thorsten Westheider, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, an error message or just a supporting e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course, thanks to all these excellent musicians on the net, who give us these wonderful MIDIs and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition, & kmid; also found on his homepage, which is found under http: / / www.arrakis.es / ~ rlarpink / kmid.html. you can also follow the development, search for information and view images on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend a good sound card or an external synthesizer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use an FM radio or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a soundcard, you need to compile and compile with the MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL parameter. it then runs as if you had a sound card, except that you can't listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & kde; -mailing lists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple interface for MPlayer, Phono and FFMPEG. the program is used to play video files that supported by MPlayer or Phonon supported formats, as well as for playback of DVD s, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname; was not yet finished as & kde; installed on this computer.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help please check the website The KDE website for new versions, or to send the question to The & kde; User Mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is the window with the playlist. and finally there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is returned in it.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred connections under the menu bookmark, but these are single entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played by each other, you should use the category Permanent Playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchical level. if you click on an entry, its group and all its sub-groups are copied to the current category and playback starts with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', TV and permanent playlists can also be changed by editing XML configuration files. of course you can only do this if & KMPlayer; not running. the various files in the ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / directory can be changed by an editor, from the menu view and next editing mode. by clicking a subgroup, only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, select Playlists from the menu and select either the Edit mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost if the editing mode is left or another group is selected without comparing it to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer; some functions can only be enabled by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation at startup and exit can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and changing [General Options] No Intro = 0 obble option to '1'. if the option is not present, it can be inserted easily.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to enable another animation. & KMPlayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / ww.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation at startup doesn't need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. this would be disturbing for the end-animation, the user can therefore finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photographer: & lt; & lt; & lt; img dur = "incorrectly" src = "file: / / / home / Koos / mum.gif" fit = "meet" / lt; / smilted; In the directory tests / some examples of SMIL are supported by & KMPlayer; supported.</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the Configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; here the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the 'Console' button in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here is the output of mplayer visible.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this rendition in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; everything must be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc, just like setting up the backend by mimetype. here is an example of how a 'flash' is played with the module swfdec-mozilla:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & KMPlayer; it can even insert the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">For the & KMPlayer; to play 'flash' in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module as a service provider for the mime type application / x-shockwave-flash in the setup dialog file Regulations of KDE must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; can be started in a console application and searched for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library. if there are no errors, the Backend Edition is within & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu to check).</seg>
<seg id="1726">In order to always take a given backend for a certain mime type (of course only if this was also determined), this must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, Phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play from TV cards, either via MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before watching TV, the device and the TV channels need to be configured. for this purpose, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring VDR (Video data recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog box in the Settings is under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there should be detected ports from which one is selected. the encoding must be found (e.g. it is PAL for Western Europe), the correct name probably has a dvd in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of KMPlayer only XVideo can use, XVideo should also work (probably this way of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). therefore, the videoforlinux extension for the X server must be functional. therefore, the XFree86 server must contain the following in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config)</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, KMPlayer uses different names for the sources. at the time of creating this documentation, these are dvdnavsource, dvdsource, exitsource, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource and vdren.When enabled, they start playing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Is there any hint of how I can make my CDROM drive more quiet if I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command HDPARM -E 8 / dev / cdrom is the user root to run the device. it is absolutely certain to make sure that / dev / cdrom indicates the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts slowly, why do I have to check my CPU for performance every time?</seg>
<seg id="1734">Note: the answer is overhauxt. kxineplayer automatically needs the last saved value, only the first time xine check the CPU.</seg>

<seg id="1741">QT;: & Qt; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and networking support, and is needed to compile & dump.</seg>
<seg id="1742">Latex;: a professional writing application. under Unix-like systems it is likely to rely on the package & texlive; or & tetex; (for older systems).</seg>
<seg id="1743">Most of these components can be included in the Linux distributions used & Linux. for installation, documentation of the distribution or installation CD; / DVD should be used.</seg>
<seg id="1744">The & Kile; Project contains some pre-compiled packages from & Kile; for different distributions. they enable easy installation without further compiling and are included on the box; website.</seg>
<seg id="1745">This manual is for everyone - regardless of experience with & latex;, & kde;, & Kile; or & Linux;.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Advanced users probably don't have to read this manual. however, all the suggestions for documentation are taken into account. if the support for this project or its documentation is requested, contact via the box; website should be made.</seg>
<seg id="1747">If you have any questions or if you want to compile and / or add extensions, this should be addressed to the mailing list Kile-devel @ lists.sourceforge.net.</seg>
<seg id="1748">& Kile; is an integrated and latex; environment for the & kde; - desktop. & Kile; offers the possibility to use all and latex; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple, immediate and tailor-made access to all and latex; programs. finally, the easy-to-use assistant, the & latex; reference and the powerful project management.</seg>
<seg id="1749">To learn more about & Posters; and its ways to experience the manual of Kate should be consulted. users of & Kile; can start there directly with reading the chapter's work with the Editor of & Posters.</seg>
<seg id="1750">For and latex; is the correct language: Lay-TECH. while the initial & tex; difficult to operate, a layman (englishlay) & latex; -macros can also use. a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it descends from the surname of Leslie La mport.</seg>
<seg id="1751">While here only a good overview of and latex is given, it is not the ultimate book on it. to be able to master correctly, good books e.g. H. Kopka / P. W. Daly, A Guide to and latex;: document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, may be consulted in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The introduction contains at least the command\\ documents.com, the body starts with the command\\ begin {document} and must be closed again using the command\\ end {document}.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The quick entry assistant of & Kile; is a useful feature for speedy creation of a document in & box; the selection of the wizard (MenÃ ¼ r) offers some options for creating the document. there can also be some settings related to the document.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document classes: this introduces the type of document to be created: article (article), book [book], report [scrartcl], report (DIN) [scrdcl], report (DIN) [scrdcl], book (DIN) [scrbook], film [Prosper] or user-defined.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Encoding: this is used to set the encoding of the system. modern systems are increasingly using UTF-8 encoding as standard. at best UTF-8X should be selected (for correct processing of & latex; documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most commonly used additional packages for and latex; they must be selected only in the check box for the integration.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), book (DIN), report (DIN), letter (DIN): the document classes of Koma-Script (to comply with German DIN regulations). you should always find use in creating German texts.</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users do not have to worry. it is merely a brief description of the functions and further information is given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& Kile; offers - as well as other source code editors - highlighting the used commands, settings and elements (as well as the inappropriate). by viewing large areas of a green text on the screen, it is likely that any mathematical environment has not been closed.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With automatic completion of environments, when entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) from & Kile; automatically generates an empty line (to enter the text) and the associated line to the command of the command (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be disabled in the Settings box... LaTeX commands are disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually subdivided into some elements. & latex; allows the subdivision of the document to be divided into the following elements (part is the highest and subparagraph the bottom element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of a mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful for searching. as soon as a DVI file is created, you can jump & drop; by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI; -viewer to the corresponding line in & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information like the font and besides PDF is the other output type of & tex; or & latex;. there are many tools for viewing, converting and printing DVI; files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the scroll search, the elements of the DVI; file with the editor are clipped and once clicked to an element in the DVI file; the exact opposite of it. as soon as a section in the & latex; source text has been clicked, the corresponding place is jumped into the DVI; -viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this feature is used when working with multiple files. with a master document, the work is simplified with other .tex files. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set about project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Fast building: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (if there are no source code errors).</seg>
<seg id="1768">Video surveillance: in this mode, the DVI; file is recorded in the "Awederungenâ" in this mode, and there is no call from & ocepiece; after the fast construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the Edit tool bar, the three large selection fields should be noticed. the selection fields have been developed for the quick insertion of common elements into the document. the first drop-down box is for the quick structure of the document into parts, chapters, sections,... The available and latex; instructions for subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The Other is for inserting items such as keywords, notes or notes. the available options are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command a name for a section, a picture or other element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: is used for reference to a specified term (selection via a selection box possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote, a selection list with literary entries is displayed. at & bibtex; this only works if the file belongs to a project. the author has good experience with & kbtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can also be written in & kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-down box with the name GrÃ ¶ e is used for the definition of the Sets. there can be set the Sets for the main text, the notes nodes, etc. the following types of fonts are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & Kile; two choices are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings. 2. the document can be written from scratch by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The parentheses after the command\\ documentclass contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] defines the Sets. if the font is not set at the beginning, this can also occur in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the source code above has been entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is the use of the Menem Building or the Schnellstart button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved before compiling. & Kile; it automatically executes the storage.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the document is compiling, it should be searched for errors in the logging process. if fast construction is used, the eyepiece should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the recording should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the written text 12 is created and only a few columns should have a different type. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment}.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes will be supervised only within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\ end {environment}). there is no limit (number) for changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the readability and ease of use of the document. for example, certain fonts, bold, italics, underscores, etc. can be added. these commands end either with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for recursive printing and is valid until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or any other environment. a single word in a set can be italicized with\\ emph {Word} italic.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quota: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ begin {quote} and ends with\\ end {quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background for writing the source text with the & latex; drawing language has been presented, a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & Kile follows.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once a bit of text has been entered in the wizard, a few adjustments should be made for the better readability of the document. for this purpose, a quote, a few paragraphs in bold and italic pressure and a poem should be applied to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, the editor View or Strg E can be returned to the editor (in the case of an internal viewer).</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI file is created, the document can be printed or converted to a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try out and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent file format (eng. D e V ice I ncl). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed using a file (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The tool bar allows the conversion of the DVI; file to other formats. once the DVI file is created from the & latex; source code, the conversion can begin in desired other formats using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The preview function allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI file; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; offers a corresponding setting for all and latex; binaries. to do this, simply set up Modern under Settings box... Construction can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to execute the pre-selection, the mouse-cursor must be positioned in a row of the source text and then clicked on forward looking. the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI; viewer is then taken.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & Oceyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; -document the corresponding & latex; -document from & Kile; opened and jumped into the corresponding line. to do this, & Kile; in & Oceyepiece; set up as text editor (setting up settings... editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">Should an error occur when using the & DVI file; if there is an error, this will be displayed in the logging file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file explains the source of errors in the source code. in the editor, the buttons predefined LaTeX errors and NÃ ¤chster LaTeX errors can be used for leaps between errors. to view the faulty line, you have to click on the error in the logging and & Kile; jumps to the wrong line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once the button in the toolbar is clicked, a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting empty documents, a document can either be rewritten from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document. more information on this can be found in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Hands-on users of & latex; mostly use the same introduction for virtually all documents. templates can be created in & box; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or a new file is created. & Kile; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting File Template from document...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template by file New, some strings are replaced with other data (e.g. name or character encoding).</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by typing in document class. typically it is used as a file:\\ documents.com [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$]</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document is created in this way, the following steps must be executed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, your own template can then be selected instead of the standard ones.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files. if an easy way to create a template is required, it should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described under described steps should be executed.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kile; used & Posters; as an internal editor. & Posters; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and emphasizing from many different types of text files (including also & latex; and & bibtex;).</seg>
<seg id="1809">To find out more and its possibilities, the manual of Kate should be consulted. users of & Kile; can start there directly with reading the chapter's work with the Editor of & Posters.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very practical & latex; command reference, which can be called by the menu LaTeX reference. it contains a concise description of almost all commands which can be found in & latex; use and its syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with pressed Ctrl key to select the & tex; this means that when the\\ par\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key, parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to browse and emphasize different kinds of source texts. for example, the & latex; orders from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can add additional jump marks. this is a separate type of bookmarks within the text. the menu entries do highlight the jump to the next or last jump mark. this is also highlighted, so that it is automatically deleted when typing a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like & Kile; although & Posters; already excellent possibilities were added in & Kile; important functions for writing a & latex; source code added. & latex; special commands for their selection. under Edit Selecting are the following commands for selecting text:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Heals a complete paragraph (group of lines containing an empty line on both sides). this extended meaning includes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code. the only exploiting thing in & Kile; is that the yields are separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">This selection also has an extended meaning since this command also contains and latex; -commands with a running lash (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">For removing part of the document, it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Delete key. & Posters; offers the key Ctrl + K with which the entire row is removed. & Kile; offers with own commands for faster possibility.</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removed a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & Kile; is included in the description to modify the selection item.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarified that environments play a central role in and latex; therefore, & Kile; for more orders under Edit environment for a fully simple work with and latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command is used to jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command is used to jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="1824">When the cursor is in front of or within the command\\ begin {environment}, the cursor jumps to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested environment commands, the Overview of the surrounding environment can be quickly lost. this command will close the recently opened environment, so that the nested surrounding structure will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups, which are determined by clips {...}. under Edit teX group are a few important commands that correspond to those from the Edit environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command jumped at the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command is used to jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is).</seg>
<seg id="1829">When the cursor is in front of or behind the scaled bracket of a & tex; group #, the group will jump to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many nested shuttered groups-clasps it can quickly become lost. this command joins the recently opened group, so that the nested structure of the & tex; -groups is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple suits are used as seminal vesicles. for the beneficial implementation is used in & kile; the sign "used for two simple suits. & Kile; knows this case and leads to two connecting notes for and latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic insert of double quotes can be set up under Settings... LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">You can also use specific settings (e.g. naudi or French) and therewith German or French suits. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">While holding Shift + Enter key, enter an intelligent line break. if the current position is located within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & Kile; not just a line break, but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Within a table environment, the current line with\\\\ associated with an adjoining line break.</seg>

<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange columns in tables -environments and thereby all Et characters (amp;) among themselves. & Kile; tries to invent this. by pressing Shift; Alt; amp; searches & Kile; after the nicest tab in the above row.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & Posters; already provides good source code completion, it was added in & Kile; to include special commands (mostly for natural latex;). three of these are installed for automatic completion. all these modes can be set up for different modes of operation under Settings box... To be set up permanently.</seg>
<seg id="1839">At the beginning a new environment is added by the command\\ begin {environment} & Kile; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the key, the last letter of the input will be removed and erroneously obscured by this the complete list. on the other hand, the list can also be reduced by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. the descriptions are, of course, removed from the selection of a command. alternatively, jump marks can be inserted, so that a simple jump to these positions is possible by editing jumps and then the desired parameters can be added.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings box; set up... Kile; Complete settings can be made to these lists. there can be different parts lists for & tex; - and & latex; commands as well as wipers of the general language used can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not useful for the completion of environments. there are always a few letters begin to begin with\\ begin and calling the complete defense mode will result in a large list of surrounding commands. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & Kile; a special mode for completion of environments for disposal.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the full-space environment or the Shift key Alt + Shift key, the command is automatically inserted to open the environment and it appears\\ begin. afterwards, the ambient operation can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is done, the environment is automatically closed again. once & Kile recognizes that it is a list environment, a first\\ item command will be added.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings box; set up... Kile; Complete settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the list of the complete support mode for & tex; - and & latex; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Kile; support custom lists of changes that are immediately replaced by longer strings. the lists can be set up under Settings... Kile Complete. as an example of a drop down list, the example.cwl file, for example, is included in the L =\\ LaTeX entry.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is entered and the word is introduced over the menu Edit Vercomplete Abbreviation or the key Ctrl + Alt space key, the letter L will be replaced by the string\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large switches are not helpful for automatic completion. however, it has been found that many changes in one document are written more than once. thus, & Kile; the completion for all already written walls.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the Settings box... Kile Complete. here you can also set the threshold for displaying the completion.</seg>

<seg id="1853">PS files are not as well-known as PDF files, but provide an excellent basis for changes and reorders of pages. if the PDF output is required, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; tools and then converted with ps2pdf into a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">To examine the result of the work, the source code must be compiled. all building tools are grouped in groups in the creation compiling, converting and creating view.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For the compilation of the source code for viewers such as and eyepiece; or the other conversion the key individual Alt; 2 can be used. afterwards, the DVI; file can be viewed in the standard-like viewer by Alt; 3, by Alt; 4 the DVI; file can be viewed in a PS file and viewed using Alt; 5 the PS file.</seg>

<seg id="1929">The plug-ins, the & quantaplus, have to do with & quantaplus, even possibly little. this makes the plug-in system very powerful. you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone builds the wished in & quantaplus. the plug-ins can be used in a large number of & GUI; -elements.</seg>
<seg id="1930">To install a plug-in or a part, we start using the Edit menu. this opens the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows to manage all plugins included and add new ones. we describe each & GUI; -element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plugins without a location, & quantaplus; this path to search the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often, several people work in a kind of hierarchical relationship to each other. & quantaplus; support the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift + F7 Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and e-mail entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the user's nickname and serves to uniquely identify.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member may have several roles in the project, such as both team leaders and sub-project leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of team members who he is. this happens by looking out the team member from the list and pressing the Setze button. the currently selected member (their identity) appears bold after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the setting of your own identity are important in terms of news and comments. see for further information on comments.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to an overview of their team, there is another benefit by capturing members of the team: an event can be generated for information to the team leaders when something is happening. see in for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something happens in the project. an example would be drawing up and closing the project so that later it can be seen how much someone worked on it, or sending a message when a file is saved, or a script that enters a file into CVS, as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the Side Event configuration of the Shift + F7 Project Properties dialog, events can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email will be sent to the addressees selected in the recipient list. addressees can be a team or subproject leader.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Notes are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by the following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">Input notes is simple. either the note entry from the editor context menu can be selected or the @ annotation keyword can be entered in a comment field followed by annotation text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Notes can be sent to a certain member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), where nickname is the nickname of the team member, plays a role in the project from the following options:</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roles names are case-sensitive, but spaces around the brackets and the: make the note invalid.</seg>
<seg id="1946">& quantaplus; is a development environment for scripting and formatting languages that is DTD agnostic and supports web-based formatting and scripting languages.</seg>

<seg id="1948">Settings can be set up by setting Quanta... This dialog extends over several pages that are treated consecutively.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behavior of & quantaplus; concerning tags including code completion can be modified with it. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / lowercase of tags: large / lowercase of automatically inserted tags. normal case / lowercase means the tags are inserted in the way they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / lowercase of attributes: large / lowercase of automatically inserted attributes. normal upper / lower case, the attributes are inserted in the way they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically include: if checked, for tags that the closing tag is optional, it is inserted immediately after the & gt; inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Do not include optional tags: as above for all other tags, with the exception of the simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Automatically update the start and finish tag: if enabled, the corresponding ending tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic replacement of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into the corresponding encoding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for the detection of different types of files. the default settings can be restored using the Standard button.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Default character encoding: the encoding of newly created or otherwise opened files (where the encoding of the file can be skipped). however, this setting here will be ejected from the same in the project features if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD has not been detected. however, this setting is emitted from the same in the project features if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates backup copies on a regular basis, so that the document can be recovered from this backup when the program starts or crashes. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">Previewing and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in a separate view (or documentation in a tab), making it possible to view the documentation, preview and source text at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Reset the window settings to the default when the next start is useful when the user interface is pervaded by changing MDI modes and andocking / dependencies of views. it corresponds to the --resetLayout command line parameter.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning message area is used to control the warning of warnings by hooks of no more questions.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place to change the behavior of & VPL; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as sync behavior of the VPL- and source code view in shared mode. see the different modes see.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree showing the parser nodes in the document can be adjusted in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the area of mouse click on the structure tree, the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the area of structural tree settings, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the refresh frequency of the tree when editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree should be opened automatically. empty nodes are the empty areas in the text, while empty groups are the ones in which no element was found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Abbreviations are divided into groups, each one can be valid for several & DTEP; s valid, divided. this means there may be a valid group for PHP in which the ifnd order abbreviation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">In this case the plug-ins can be managed. plug-ins are the third party's part-applications, which can be re-used by any part-enabled application, the most known & konqueror; when inserting a plug-in, the following must be given:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not at a standard location like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plugin at startup, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Load component in the Read Only mode: check if the plug-in refuses to load. only-Lesis-KParts normally deny loading if this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plugin: if this is enabled, then test & quantaplus; if the entered information is correct. then select the entry if the plug-in is not available at the moment, but it will be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; beginning version 3.3, the error search was developed completely new. the support for the no more necessary built-in & PHP; (3) debugger was set, as well as the support for the DBG debugger. instead a debugger plugin concept was implemented that allows different implementations via plug-ins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plugin is available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; inserts.</seg>
<seg id="1975">Using the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plugin in the project settings. with the Options button next to the Debugger plugin select field, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is activated for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all holding points are listed with line numbers and conditions. usually appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as in HTML) of the debugger is shown. normally appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">This action is used to connect to debugger if necessary, or it tells the plugin to listen to debugging claims. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a debugger so that normally it does not have to be taken care of.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debuggen session Start the session. closes the connection to the debugger or terminates listening to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a debug requirement. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the debugger output view.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Tells the debugger to start executing the script and sending information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution will continue. if it happens before a debugger request has started, the script starts with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Tells the debugger to start executing the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, the execution continues. if it happens before a request is made, the execution starts as soon as a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger performs the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger performs the next instruction in the script, where it is possible to clean in functions and include.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Assign the debugger to skip the statement and go to the next as if there were the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered, which is to be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1991">& kxsl; is a work by Keith Icelander as well as this part of the documentation. & kxsl; is a & kde; front end and a part of xsldbg, which you can find on http: / / xsldbg.sf.net with many more works by Keith.</seg>

<seg id="1993">Document type Editing Packets (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; provide support for market and scripting languages as well as & CSS; they allow & quantaplus. their simplicity and flexibility makes & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s exist in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages or & CSS; s & DTEP; s consist of two parts, the tag folder and the toolbar. tag folders contain two file types, the tags and descriptionrc; and TagXML files with the extension .tag.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see in for details on converting.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how to create tag XML files, then the & descriptionrc; and also toolbars. in short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML Files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog, the & quantaplus; for the tag. the & descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folders. they only contain the descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folders bear the name of the description language and version, so available. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declared if they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about possibilities and limits is presented in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a tag XML document. it can happen only once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains nothing but one element type above itself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when used, & lt; attr &gt; is an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only for the class class. the name of the base class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the type method. records the name of the class where this method belongs. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within that tag can be added to any other day. (only family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">This element can only be used once for each attribute. it specifies the name and type of attribute. additionally, it contains additional tags describing how to display this attribute & etc; This is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source code used for filling the attributes in the tag editor dialog and the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; is used to achieve the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus; used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a interface and a method name. the arguments passed to the method can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag grouped together the elements of a list. it can occur only once for an attribute description. it is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attribute text of a tags within a dialog. this tag can occur only once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each one; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog (i.e. one for each one; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that end a tag. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with a & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces affect nothing but watch & & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt;. this will not cause a break, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the tools dialog is at the top of & quantaplus; window to start and check tagXML. a further dialog will appear, with simple instructions to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not yet available. currently, the check only takes place when loading the TagXML files in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2021">The following is an example of a family 1 tag XML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this tagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following, an example of a working family 2 tag XML file. in this file a & PHP; overloading function is described. the filename of this tagXML file is to be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt; tag name = "overload" type = "function" returnType = "function" / &gt; & lt; / tag &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for doing DTD processing DTD settings. thus, diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] version = Return 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN) No nickname = The simplified name of the DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional).</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with settings actions... to be created. click New action to go to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The keyboard shortcut assigned to this action. by clicking on the user defined button, a shortcut can be assigned; with K1, the current keyboard shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the defined settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document to the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited), which change the document or use as input (or parts of the document), are started. examples from & quantaplus; even the quick start dialog or the various See in... actions for (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myhome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. In this way, & quantaplus; to find the script at the following places: $KDEHOME / share / quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will be replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file is removed from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with PID of the current & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text is appended to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; the external script is used.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script input from & quantaplus can be received from the default input. input can be specified in the input field, which is to be sent to the default input.</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only meaningful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the exported application can be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, written to the default output; error messages, run to the default output. it can be specified, which is to be done with the text written to the default output by setting the value of the selection field output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group. in the given case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the markup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar has been added, you need to add and configure actions. select Options to set actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all necessary fields and add the tag to the suitable toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and, if the tag has attributes and you are planning their use, enable "Edit Tag" dialog when available to enable entry when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let's replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action represents better, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the & KMenu;, Graphics Other programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol will not only help you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the fact that the day starts, is called, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually seen as loose, rigid, further interpreted), or at least, a message to the user will be signalled that clicking this symbol will insert a & lt; startd; -tag in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it has to be connected with the action. this is done via the menu with settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. next to the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored icon is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the button and continue with other tags, so there are still some, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; features to the toolbar, or it should be shared to a better overview by some dividers into several groups. open the toolbar and set Dialogue On Settings Toolbar. make sure the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">After selecting the element to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want a quick way to access the Konqueror Preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the dividers support grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar might believe that the & konqueror; -Button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by trying out all the symbols to make sure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">After New eXML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the right folder. please adjust its & descriptionrc; so that its toolbar (s) will be loaded when a file is opened by the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how to create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository if anyone has done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first, you need to look for an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; then you need to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = your description for these documentations e.g. & PHP; 4.2 Documentation Section 1 = Section1.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.1.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.1.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.3.html...</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can see in the & PHP documentation:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config file [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = Introduction,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that there are subfolders in the tree with its own content. there is no known border for the depth of boxes (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top of the tree view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing but watch & & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the doccrc file that is used to create context-sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script should display the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (context list) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of context elements that are separated by side-painting (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can simply save your docrc file to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as you specified it in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth dividing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation were used for the & quantaplus; -community. you won't be rich, but proud to have collaborated with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus you are not alone. it is possible to share the failed resource (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or otherwise. at various locations there is an Email-send menu entry like DTD DTD packet (DTEP) sending mail, tool bar toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the Scripting tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded to our main archives, from where all other & quantaplus; users can download them. the contributions are checked and only made available when our team uses them as correct and useful for publishing. in order to make a good contribution, we recommend to sign the resources for which there is a GPG / PGP key. thus, the origin of the resources is guaranteed, both for our team and for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you will be asked for your passphrase for your private GPG key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can choose one. in the New Resources dialog, you have to fill out the input fields (URL preview can remain empty) and start uploading with clicking OK.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD DTD packet (DTEP) menu, uploading tool bar toolbar, and in the context menu of files and folders in the Template and Scripting tree are started.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and marking. in case of problems it warns and it can then be broken down. if the integrity is given and the resource correctly signed, a message appears stating the source of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages currently not by & quantaplus; however, the creation can be time-consuming, because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tagXML format. there is a simpler way to automatically convert a DTD into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the menu DTD loading and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which should be used. then the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype definition line: the string that appears in! doctype tag like HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of DTEP after conversion: if enabled, & quantaplus; after conversion the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. to understand them and to get full benefit from & quantaplus, one must first familiarize themselves with these fundamental concepts.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus, the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & quantaplus. all that is selected as global is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to secure various tool operations, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user's directory, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a particular project. this can be anything from & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply put, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which emoglows the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the tree view, the flashcards with information and the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the tab with the right mouse button to receive a context menu with the current document, such as closing the current, other or all flashbacks, recharging, deleting or uploading the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-clicking in the editor area will lead to a further context menu with regard to the edited document content, such as basic editing steps (cutting / copying / paste), editing the tag under the mouse cursor or opening the file when the string under the mouse-cursor describes a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the Editor window are the tool bars of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as a standard for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of the further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and associated user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a single tag, e.g. & lt; insert into your document, then click the icon that represents the tag. now you can insert the data for this just inserted day. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchors), you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The building views (QIT;) make it possible to navigate in the information to & quantaplus; to navigate, to open and to roam it. in the presentation with box guides are available for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation tree views.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool called & quantaplus. this view shows all files in the project and allows to manage the files in the project by right click. actions like adding, removing, uploading or deleting files from the storage media can be done with the context menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another way of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, an entire website, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on which context they are used. the category will depend on & quantaplus; working area. global templates are always available, local templates only available for the appropriate user and templates in projects are available only in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of structuring in Global, Local and Project can also be found here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right clicking on an element, a list of commands will open in relation to the navigation and refresh of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. with it, you can quickly change attributes and namespaces. the application system aligned with the content allows you to change all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation of web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from quantaplus; 'Documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be added, edited and viewed on a project-specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two tabs at the bottom of the window can be accessed via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab displays information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab displays all errors in the markup of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed give all error messages (as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command. the chocolate page of the toolbar is the option to define own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with email; & quantaplus; send the toolbar as compressed Tar archive via & kmail; if you receive a toolbar in an email, you can secure and load it in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the & quantaplus; -files on your system. for this, autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH is in front of your bin folder. the same goes for & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE desktop. & quantaplus; designed for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML; editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus; a stand-alone, extensible markup language editor? well, this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer restricted to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus; therefore the appropriate & IDE; for that purpose.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be recorded that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; developer community. & quantaplus; following, in good application of free software, the idea of Why to develop what already someone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; framework, it allows users and developers, & quantaplus to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document interface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is almost every task.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly evolved into a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More detailed documentation is provided with help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; type, or khelpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric Laffler Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, with the oldest entry taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use. look into the templates section. should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts special characters to & HTML when pasting from the clipboard, so that they are displayed correctly and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard in & URL; merge, which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. first and foremost to insert & URL; s used in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">This allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful when your & PHP; script gives error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Looks for a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a sort of grep or sed with GUI and pre-defined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window where you can see the display of script actions and debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Switching and switching the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as you change to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">When there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next, depending on the position of the cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from disk. & quantaplus; -Projects are saved with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that might be there. this allows you to copy graphical files into your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Upload the files in your project to the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and whether you have downloaded further input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings such as & quantaplus; the project is managed. in chapter & quantaplus; projects you will find the details explained.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbar. these are stored in project-Dir / toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your tool bar. allows you to select the tool bar type: locally or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this only creates the name. actions need to be added by setting actions... Save tool bars are saved via toolbars toolbar buttons or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. it does not delete it from the hard drive. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you'll be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team so that the toolbar is present in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Enables uploading of toolbars to the main server, where anyone can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Loading a & DTD; which you or anyone else has done and convert into the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP; should be freshened up without renewing the whole & DTEP; if this is global and does not exist in the global KDE folder, the load fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbars. if the default (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, in the Tags menu, there is a submenu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current tag settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivates the intelligent insertion of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML-DTDs. intelligent inserting means that & quantaplus; the insertion is denied by tool bar if this tag is contrary to the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the Plugins menu, the available plugins are listed under the menu items mentioned above. click on it. click an activated plug-in deactivates it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on the Posters; -Version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Selects the type of line-end identifier. very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document based on the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Instant switching between different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching can sometimes need time or create unnice graphics. the card-card mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for each open sub-window. selecting an entry will activate the corresponding subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Toggles the status bar display at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog affects any application that uses the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Set the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & kate; see details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears in which you can delete entries from the toolbar or add which you can add and modify the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create help according to the environment of the mouse pointer, but is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and free licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be filled out from top to bottom, because, for example, after completing the project name, the entire directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically. all these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift + F7 project project properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name, file is filled in automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase letters and without spaces with extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you have the server address of the machine you want to access, except you process local data. either a name (hostname.g) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the chosen log will be used. depending on the remote host setting, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where templates for the project are stored. it is a relative path to the project and templates. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and toolbars by default. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows you to insert files from the local filesystem to the project. you can select multiple files or entire folder.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. in case of server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Let it be checked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be included. if a project is started from scratch, do not hook up.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an exact selection according to good manure.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of the files in the main folder. you can select the files you want by hook or by removing the tick from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard includes three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project project properties in the menu tree in the subwindow profiles or with Shift + F7 key shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (placeholders) that are ignored in project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, including files listed in .cvsignore, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows the desired debugger to be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger plugin can be set using the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the Profile panel profiles, high load profiles (see in) can be set, as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by contacting one's own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the team configuration window, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration window, you can turn event actions and add, modify, or delete event actions. event actions are executed when a previously specific event occurs, such as backing up a file.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus; the last project that was open. you cannot influence this behavior right now.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Open Project... from the Project menu or the Symbol Project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will open and allows selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file is saved automatically. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project tree view gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders are the same, but the entries are missing and opened with... in the context menu that can be activated with the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removal of the current profile. if only one profile is present, the button is blended to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten by the user. this option is useful when frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather unreliable password on the disk save option is not in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many high-loader profiles can be created and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the server name on which the files are to be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least, you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally, this does not need to be changed, except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your threshold, this is either a time saving feature or a danger. use it at your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so it cannot be read easily, but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and toolbars. there can be many views in a project, i.e. by simply changing the view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"" "views can be opened, opened or deleted in the menu" "" "Project or Project toolbar," "" "via Settings tool bar" "" "Project toolbar" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has the most to do. this not only helps increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus to their own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, toolbars in & quantaplus are best stacked over the menu toolbar. the addition of toolbars is treated at the bottom of the Add of toolbars section.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the icons can be set either by context menu (right-click on the toolbar), where new action, a new toolbar can be created. other actions such as tool bar can be removed, toolbar buttons or tool bars can be executed, which can be displayed in the dialog where it can be specified, which actions should be visible on this or other toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, the entries action will also be removed and action processed that are intended to be self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with settings toolbar... and setting actions can be set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially a document skeleton, code snippets and files to link. & quantaplus; basically uses templates as a common file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or link any directory existing in the system to the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is everything that is not pure text. it can be binary except text, i.e. images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc. binary templates are usually found in documents using links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url).</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be from any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. usually, more specialized documents are nested in corresponding subfolders. you make a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in the appropriate way to be efficient.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template, but the same text area should always be inserted in the documents. you can find everything from a comment about a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl-base. some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for whole websites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure as you like (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and save file As template Save as local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this has occurred, note that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click on File As template, save selection as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can simply be dragged and dropped onto the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. all file management functions can be used for it, such as drag and drop or insert via the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">In the file tree or in the project file tree view, click on a folder on the right and select site template, enter a name for the template and secure it. by default, it is backed up in the project folder, but of course it can also be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates provide a very target-oriented procedure. you can predefine headlines and footers, or dynamic with & PHP; design, insert files or link them with them. additionally, you can keep an eye on some things while using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files filed in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / apps and $HOME / .kde / apps / Quanta / templates. each folder corresponds to one of four types of containers, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder, right-click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A drop-down box with the three types previously described; files, text or templates. this selection is dazzled once the attributes are browsed.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits everything except the regular folders in the template overview. if a root folder is set in such a way, it would disable templates in this path, except they would be explicitly activated. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, you will probably be in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows for predefined or copied text for templates in this folder. this could be general headers or footers for all templates for a particular project and allows for copying of content templates to a folder with special header lines / footers to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (show, right mouse button down) via a complete command collection to add folders or copy and paste templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; provides two modes: VPL; Editor and VPL; & Source editor, which can be accessed via the View menu. the first mode replaces the source text editor by the VPL; editor and the second divides the editor window into two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and revert to the source code editor where the changes made in the VPL; editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor at a document containing & PHP; a small green icon displays the default of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; to edit it, the source text editor is still necessary. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first one except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source text editor as well as in the VPL; editor in sync. pressing F9 this mode is already active, the push of the button moves the active cursor from one window to another, keeping the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; editor and the source code editor is adjustable by setting Quanta. after choosing VPL; you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation: a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so tools document properties can be selected. thus editing of invisible tags at work with the VPL; editor is possible. the document properties dialog is called as soon as a new document with the VPL; editor is created.</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click into the list allows the change of the content, e.g. keywords on the column names and keyword Keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in your browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list. a change over the list is just as possible with the meta-elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The cursor is like in a word processor, by moving the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the cursor behaves strange. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and dropped by button or distance button.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The insertion of tags is done in the same way via the toolbars, as in the source code editor. note that inserting tags previously does not remove existing identical tags, e.g. when an anchor tag is inserted, surround with text, any other drop anchor tag must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some tool bars, such as the Wizard Wizard or the Listen Assistant, are disabled. they will later work in & VPL; in this release tables or lists must be used toolbar buttons.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kDiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts while merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed only the changed lines, but I couldn't see what had changed within these lines, and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kDiff3; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and paste it in one of the comparison windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & kDiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful if two people work independently on one piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps & kDiff3; when automatically selecting the correct changes. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kDiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kDiff3; when merging folders:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kDiff3; displays the exact differences and supports the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you need to check code frequently, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are displayed. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left. (no more trouble if someone alters the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal and the other is different in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can make the typing work easier by writing only the file name of the first file. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Chdiff3 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">Opening dialog allows manual typing of filenames, selecting a file browser (file...) or selecting an recently opened file from the drop-down list. the opening dialog tells you your selection and shows it the next time. you don't need to specify a third file. if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of the differences is done with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Through the folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the merge or merge of folders will be initiated. if a file is selected for A, but for B and C a folder, then use & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merging is enabled, the input field is active for target and can be edited. however, it is not strictly necessary to immediately set an output file. you can do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before starting to merge / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kDiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in Open dialog you do not need to select any files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to figure out how similar these features are, it would be a relatively large effort. you only need to create two corresponding files, they in & kDiff3; load them and then compare them. now you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can't extract anything from & kDiff3; only dropping text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors will interpret and paste text into another program than cut and paste (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible row in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Every info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, leave the mouse for a while above the line. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color Green and C is magenta. (these default settings can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, you can see in the color which file differs. if both files differ, the default color for it is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files. this is in the next section (merging) good to see.</seg>
<seg id="2306">If differences are found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages, where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (in C / C + + for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few, rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the line break is activated, the line is dotted with broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (below the comparison windows) also has an info line with the output:, the filename and [Gear] when you edited the result. usually it contains text by automatic merging, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is deactivated!!! (use the Springe button to find the next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparisons are used, each difference is at the same time a conflict that needs to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows, the group belonging to the row is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. this group will then be the current group.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes by automatic merging or by manual editing, no more line is left in the group; then in these lines the text & lt; no line in the queue will be displayed. this is only a placeholder in the event that you change your mind and perhaps re-insert another source.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merging conflicts; however, appears in the clipboard, if you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate most with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, side down, beginning, end, Ctrl-Start and Ctrl-end, Siw as you can also use it from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the default window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. with the Insert key, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as already explained in the Configuration section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-down / Ctrl-above), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture upward / Ctrl-above) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marking to the clipboard, you need to press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). if enabled, whatever you mark will be automatically copied to the clipboard and the manual copying is removed. be careful with this option, because you could overwrite the contents of the clipboard accidentally.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are saved according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use carriage return + newline\\ r\.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically at exit and restored at the next start. (setup menu settings - &gt; KID3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with a fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences in italic script will be displayed. if the chosen typeface does not support this representation, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors may not be available in their pure form, but would be displayed scaled. on these systems, the presets button automatically adjusts an unjust color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is enabled, the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab key. otherwise, a tab character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press Enter or Return, the indentation of the preceding line will be used automatically for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is enabled, each selection will be automatically copied to the clipboard. then you will not need to copy manually into the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which newline type you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, & kDiff3; first, find all the completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. the second step compares each row. in this step, white characters are not ignored. even when merging, white characters are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a carriage return character '\\ r' and a line feed '\' at the end of a line, others save only a newline character '\'. usually, the carriage return character is made visible, but as a white character is treated. during merging, this option must be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">This option is disabled in default. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The option is enabled by default. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the auto-jump mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before jumping to the next unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2335">(default is manual selection.) This is useful when white characters are less important in many files. if you only need this from time to time, then use the functions Choose A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are discussed in the chapter to scan folders and perform a merge operation. see documentation for directory comparison and merge for details.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already exists an older version, the original version will be appended to the suffix .orig. if such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without any further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adjust the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the currently running program. you need & kDiff3; quit and restart, so that the change is active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kDiff3; not available because the language is set globally via the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Above the encoding fields for coding a short note appears, which is the local coding. (this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted. as coding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different coding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding to use for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files might be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of pre-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn off this to suppress highlighting of changes in white characters in text or review columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color-coded oversight column. but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you would prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. just hide the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the Windows menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you look at the differences and then decide to merge the files. merge current file into the merge menu even if you compare only two files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as preset name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. in & kDiff3; then the output of the command becomes visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor corresponding exactly to your requirements. you can use this function for example to cut disturbing parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command has been specified (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this command processor. you can write your own preprocessor exactly according to your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind this is to allow the user more flexibility in setting up the diff results. however, an external program is required and most users do not want to program this themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl are completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this command for line reconciliation to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\ 1 / 'This. * is an ergulate expression of the text found in a string. the\\ U converts the found text into upper case letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically add generated strings (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). all follow the same pattern $keyword generated text $. *\\ $\\ $\\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you may start to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in Kdiff3. but it is good as an example for a further pre-processing command for line balance. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each character between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and every hit is replaced by nothing, so quasi deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the substitutions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead you can use something other than perl -p -e's / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp / regexp.</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data according to the normal preprocessor are maintained for displaying and merging. the other operations only change the data that the line balance algorythmus looks like.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when using a normal preprocessor, the line-off preprocessor sees the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may accidentally fail to notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers have to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & kDiff3; complete folders recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object to merge; you can adjust the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate cooperations and display the simulated changes without actually performing them,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... perform selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging individual files. you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, Folder 1 will be used as the base. if no destination folder is specified, & kdiff3; Folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, not the merge. to start the merge, you need to select the corresponding menu item or press the F7 key. (see more details.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, a small message window will inform you about the current progress. if you cancel the scan of the folder, only the files that have been compared until then will be listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is completed, & kDiff3; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded up. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / -, or double-clicking on the object, or by double-clicking the arrow keys for left / right.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double-click a file, the file comparison will be started and a comparison window will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, then this is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action cannot be automatically selected. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed about problems of this kind again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries, the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered to be the same when their entire content is identical. then folders also have the same color. in folders, the age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf which is only green, then yellow and later when it is old, becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such erroneous objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such erroneous objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The synchronization mode is active, if only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified and if the option directories are synchronized. then & kDiff3; the necessary action from, so that both folders are identical. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but are not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as a visible file name for the output file only B; directly copied after merging & kDiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and the option New File instead of merge (unsafe) is selected, then examines & kDiff3; the date of the files and performs the newer file for copying. if the files are different, but the same date then appears an error message: files are different, but the date is identical.. Solange such errors are not fixed, the merging of the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">When merging, one file is processed after the other. you status column displays finished when merging is successful, and according to other messages when something unexpected occurs. if the merge is complete, you should make a final check and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full analysis, KDiff3 will display more columns. these contain the number of unresolved, deleted, not white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or Odner), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the merge actions (including all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not specify a destination folder, C will be used as a target in the Three-Folder Merge mode, B will be chosen as the destination and A and / or B will be used when synchronizing.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check that all entries that should be in the destination folder will also be displayed in the folder structure. there are some options that may be skipped by certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the shortcut). to only merge the current item, select Run action from the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If conflicting file types still exist invalid merge actions, a message appears that points to the faulty elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog box appears with the Browse, Simulate and Cancel options.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you want to see what would happen without really making any changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kDiff3; then performs certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), a merge window will open (see the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are finished with a file, choose another folder merge / continue or press F7. if you haven't saved it, a corresponding dialog appears. then & kDiff3; continue its work with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">At the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to figure out the cause of the problem. if you continue to merge (F7 key), & kDiff3; you have the option to try another action for the entry or solve the problem in a different way before proceeding to merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been individually merged, you notice & kDiff3; these entries (in the current session) and will not merge them at the later compilation of all entries. even if this merge has been skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered complete.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kDiff3; (Set Settings - &gt; KDiff3...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files matching the given pattern are displayed in the element tree. multiple patterns can be entered. separate the patterns with a semicolon;. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. (for example * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders corresponding to this pattern are not shown in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders corresponding to this pattern are not shown in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignores files that would also be ignored by CVS. many self-generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder can be configured with a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a hidden attribute. in other file systems, a preceding point selects a file as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is turned on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">For links to files: if the option is switched off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">For links to folders: if the option is switched off, the symbolic links will be compared. if the option is enabled, the links will be treated like normal folders and checked recursively. (note that & kDiff3; do not refer to possible recursions.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a full analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns. (the number of dissolved, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower if it is applied to files that do not contain text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders over a slow network, it might be faster to compare only the modified date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security. please use caution. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the change date. there is no real comparison. the files are considered to be identical when they are equal. for example, this can be useful when the change date has been lost when copying. please use caution. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Enable the synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified. in this mode, the merge suggestions are selected in such a way that both folders are identical. the results of merging files are saved in both folders. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, the copy of the newer file will be proposed as action instead of merging. (this is considered unsafe because it assumes the knowledge that the other file has not been modified too.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, then the original version is renamed and maintains the extension .orig. If an old backup file with the .orig extension already exists, it will be deleted without further backup. this also applies to the normal merging of individual files, not only the merging of whole folders. this option is turned on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder merge view is visible in the merging of individual files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want this, you can switch off the option directory & text window and switch between the list & text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You can also directly merge a single file, without having to run the folder merge. to do this, use the current file merging from the merge menu. as soon as you save the result, the status will be deleted and the file will not be merged once you launch the folder merge.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost if you re-read the directory: directory menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KID3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders that are located on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. you should note a few things:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. contain. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, whitespace &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes by the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows. then a file will always be accepted as a link destination. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or change date. therefore, the permission or modification date deviates from the original. (note the option Relationship of Size.) (This is only possible for local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is currently the difference viewer in KDEVELOR. KDEVELOR always starts the built-in difference viewer. to start KDEVELOR, press the right mouse button over the difference viewer and then select In KDEVELOR off the contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Usually needs & kDiff3; two full input files. if it is used as a part, takes & kDiff3; that the input file is a patch file in unified format. then, & kDiff3; the name of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then, & kDiff3; the patch program to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Preview in - KDiff3Part. note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kDiff3; as part is executed, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing files is not supported in the part mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and Kdiff2 (now hot compars) exist already. furthermore, the name KID3 already indicates that it can merge like the diff3 program from the Diff Tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or get it this way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from the sources and probably didn't tell the configure script to KDE. in default, configure is installed in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines will first be treated as identical, but if only a non-white character is different, the line will be treated as not identical. iF similar lines are next to each other, this is this link often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source text and selecting the A / B / C button. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as text file and it is too much effort to create a separate file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">You can always recover a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; No src left; published and the text cannot be deleted. what does that mean and how can that be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kDiff3; use already many colors to highlight differences. more emphasis would be confusing and misses the purpose. please use another editor for that.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web. thanks a lot!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kDiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of recent changes can be found under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the file ChangeLog in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde; compile and install the following command in the basic folder of the & kDiff3; -distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir returns the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Because & kDiff3; autoconf and autocommit used, you shouldn't have trouble compiling. however, if difficulties occur, please report to the & kde; -mailing lists thereof.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut (Ctrl-X or Shift Remove) copies to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift-Insert) insert the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position or replace the current marker.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Show only differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, after changes to these options, you need to re-read the folder with the Refresh function.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">This also causes identical files to be copied to the destination folder when merging. if the target folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (the behavior will probably be altered in a later program version.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the rows from the corresponding window will be appended to the end of the selected group in the result window (if the rows are already present).</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default this option is disabled. differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; displays a thumbnail of all virtual desktops. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the work surfaces, change their size, quit them or shift them. this works both inside a desktop as well as several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual desktops as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and moved even on the desktop and on others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; the movement is possible within a desktop as well as on other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: when clicked on the empty Background of & Kpager; when clicked, the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize, maximize, On desktop and exit. the commands do the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this checkbox is selected, windows within the & pager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is enabled, in & Kpager; the names of virtual desktops are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field lets the & Kpager; display the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is enabled along with name, the names will be tagged with ordinal numbers, & eg; 1st desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is checked, the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in & Kpager;</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is checked, the running programs are displayed as small windows in the & Kpager; otherwise only the empty workspaces are displayed to enable their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simple displays simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon displays the windows with their default symbol and Pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the order of the & Kpager; main window can be defined: classically & Kpager; in a 2xN grid appear, as is known from pager applications in some other window managers; horizontal displays all virtual desktops in a horizontal line, which is very good for viewing laterally on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be modified in size, view and move windows as symbols or with their contents.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click within & Kpager; and then select switch settings... allow the dialog to appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you do not have any write permission for the file, you must login as user root or turn to your system administrator. in this file you need to enter the key windowtransparentMode and assign value to it. possible values are:</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; waits a mouse-click once the mouse-cursor is persist for a while in the same place. it is meant to help people suffering from the repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and which each mouse click emulate pain.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain created while clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, the mere desire of the mouse can cause pain. if you suffer from pain associated with your computer, you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear: even if & kmousetool; to avoid pain caused by the mouse click, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic tools, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click as soon as you briefly interrupt the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the intelligent move activates, makes & kmousetool; a pause after it has emulated the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the release of the mouse button. in this way, you can drag the drawing with pressed mouse button. the intelligent move requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a mouse click executes.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If the intellect is switched on, the shooting range is active (1 / 10 s). here, the time is set, the & kmousetool; after pressing the mouse button wait before it release the mouse button again, if no moving of the mouse takes place.</seg>
<seg id="2505">If this feature is enabled, a slow moving to the right and back, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow moving to the left and back brings a double-click. these moves are started in the file $KDEHOME / share / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, though & kmousetool; the first time it is started, but can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound appears delayed, you can help to shorten the response time. open the & kcontrolcenter; go to Sound & Multimedia, select there Sound System and here the Rider General. there is a slider sound buffer that you can set to a lower value to shorten response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool; started at each start of & kde; this function is currently only available under & kde; this function is currently only available under & kde; for GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program there automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">If you have already pressed the user button, the settings will be reset to the state after the last press has been pressed.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Preferably use & kmousetool; first with the default settings. in particular, the intelligent move should be switched off first. if you then get used to the automatic mouse click, you can later accept the intelligent move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; in order to decrease with sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of which places a mouse click stays without effect: clicking on the neutral parts of windows or in places in the browser window that does not link leads to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park the mouse in such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse clicks, you should clean your mouse. that's usually pretty simple. the trick here is that you don't just clean the mouse ball, but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you need to take the mouse ball out. how this happens is different from mouse to mouse. but it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. you can scrape dirt and dirt easily with a flat blade or the fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts execution of & kmousetool; if you are using the intelligent move in this case, this means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer end by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use a different window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can execute a mouse click yourself. this will reset the status of & kmousetool; and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: when you enter text, try and kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and move the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor where you want it. but use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to make a keyboard input. thus, accidental moving of mouse clicks can cause unwanted reactions. safe zones for the mouse cursor are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the title lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with intelligent sliding, but I don't create it for editing text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent move is an advanced feature of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is quite possible to mark this way text, copy it to the clipboard and then insert any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. here are some advice on this:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move if you just start with it & kmousetool; to use it. instead, select a mouse click at one end of the text area and keep the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse cursor to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse-click. this will always play when & kmousetool; the mouse button pushes a sound like a mouse click plays. so you know exactly when when intelligent move the move time starts. later, you can use the intelligent move even without the audible mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool, the Xtest extension for & X Window needs to be installed. that should be the case on most system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and these are correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; hold the mouse button as soon as the mouse cursor is blurred. this program has been developed for people suffering from RSI syndrome and who are causing pain to the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured in such a way that there is a specific time waiting for a drag action to begin before the mouse button is released. in this way, drag and drop can also be done with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2622">To understand how filters work, it is important to know how the program "speech-dispatcher" works with a text.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders. if the output of the screen reader is read-out, the retained contracts are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important messages like & eg; processor is reserved to hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders will be continued after the output of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Messages have the next highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you & eg; have a long text read on a website, you can go with & kmouth; notifications are also news. read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. every job you send from the card list is a text order. KSayit is an example of an application that uses text orders. text orders are meant for the output of longer texts that do not possess any particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queue, except for the output of screen readers. when an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & down; just one such reading, this output is stopped and terminated.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen reaers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as to & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter the text and pass it to the next filter. at present there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there can be even further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Character Dictioners replace parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. it is supplied with predefined string translation filters that allow the creation of chat emoticons such as: -) by text or for formatting messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better comprehensible form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; -Converter is using an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert from one format to another format. in the scope of delivery, some XSLT files are included in the translation of & XHTML; in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With language selection filters you can send jobs depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to & ktts; sent to a speaker. for example, if you have set a female voice on the card holder, you can read the text from KDE messages about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has adjustable rules, by which it is applied to voice output. if the filter detects that its rules do not apply, it will continue to pass the text to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; notification to & ktts; sent, it will be processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the page below. processing by the filters takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of the established normal filters. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters are processed in series to the top downwards.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter and the following setup dialogs are displayed below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">You must enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns for setting up character sets. if these patterns are found in the text, the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name as you like, it only has to be distinguished from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the first column. the list is processed in the order from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">These buttons allow you to load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. if you load a list from a file, the entries from the file will be appended to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter will only be used if the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages registered here. click the button to display a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages if you press the & Ctrl key at the click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter several programs separated by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID of running programs is provided with the program qdbus; the & dbus; -numbers must be omitted. if for example, the application ID copy-3432 shows, you may only enter copied.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string input filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Slide filter if match. if all input fields are empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">In comparison of words, the string translation filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\. so the words must be limited on both sides by the separator character.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions. but if you have the & kde; editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; regular & # 160; for & # 160; for & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; expressions can be found in the package calle.</seg>
<seg id="2649">XSLT (XML; Style Language - Transforms) is a W3C standard for such transformations. it can only be applied to well formed XML. the xsltproc utility needs to be installed on your system.</seg>
<seg id="2650">Enter the path for the xsltproc User Language program. xsltproc can be reached by setting the PATH environment variable also xsltproc.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the Speaker Selection filter, you can send text to a specific speaker, set up on the card holder, or to a speaker with specific features. for example, you can specify that texts by kmail should be read by a female voice.</seg>
<seg id="2652">The speaker is selected based on the speaker properties which the program gives, which sends the text to & ktts; sends, and the properties of the speakers created on the card holder. with the speaker selection filter, you can override the selected speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2653">If a value is entered here, the filter will be applied if the text contains the regular expression. is installed on your system of & kde; editor and # 160; for & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can click on the button to get help when entering.</seg>
<seg id="2654">To achieve faster processing, try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Specify the properties of the speaker you want. if the text fulfills the filter conditions shown above, the speaker is selected, which meets the requirements best. click on the button on the right to see the language selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to save or load your speaker settings or delete all settings.</seg>

<seg id="2677">The program "speech-dispatcher" uses an adaptable module architecture for voice synthesizers. if you want to expand & dictate to use another synthesizer, contact the developer team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The xsltproc program is used for support of SSML and for the & XML; conversion filter, but is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc with the apt-get install xsltproc command.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile and compile, you need a current development environment from KDE (version 3.4 or later), including the packages kdelibs and the development files for the "speech-dispatcher" program.</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have downloaded the source code from & ktts; retrieved from the source code archive for cadview- or downloaded the tarball that you have created every night, compile and install the program using the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you start, make sure the speech synthesizer works properly with your speech synthesizer. you can use the shell script spd-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& kde; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of the speech given by the speech-dispatcher. the ttmsgr utility is to be developed in such a way that the setup of speech-dispatchers is possible and the script spd-conf is no longer required.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is decomposed into individual sentences. the user can leave set or paragraph mode, repeat, pause or cancel the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">For example, if you have a speaker whose language is English and whose gender is female, it will be used, otherwise the best matching speaker will be chosen. if you want to learn more about it, just look at it.</seg>
<seg id="2685">If you click Add a Spokesperson on Add to add a speaker to the list or click Edit, the tab card speaker setup will appear. as an example, the setup of the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below. for details on the modules, please refer to.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to festival is included in PATH, you only have to enter the festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the text encoding for text delivered to festival. if voices are known, the setting is automatically done. in general, Western languages use ISO 8859-1, Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these sliders, you adjust volume, speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you cannot select some controllers and display them gray, the voice you choose will not allow these settings to be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like MultiSyn voices need several seconds to load due to their size. if you mark this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD so that the first set will be synthesized faster (with larger memory consumption).</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you haven't set up a speaker yet (or click on the user to click).</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this checkbox is selected, the program window will be displayed at the start of ktesmgr. otherwise, after startup, only the ttsmgr utility is visible, but not the program window. click on the icon in the system section to view the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this checkbox is selected and ktachmgr runs not yet, it will appear in the system area once KTTSD reads a text. this allows you to pause or otherwise control the reading.</seg>

<seg id="2703">On this tab card you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a higher priority message.</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders. after the edition of the screen reader has been read, the retained assignments are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next higher priority. this level is important messages such as & eg; processor is reserved to hot. a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders will resume after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Messages have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that sends messages. if you want to read a long text on a website, you can with & kmouth; nevertheless welcome someone who just walks the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text order is interrupted by a message, warning or output of a screen reader, the audio output will be added to the queue.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for voice output. this standard contains brands for controlling voices, speech speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch. also brands for controlling the pronunciation of e.g. abbreviations. SSML is part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supported and supported; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following limitations are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You need to install the rab _ diphone voice (British male) since it is the default voice that uses the festival in the output of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or tonality in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100%, the SSML text is usually spoken very monotonously.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and bylaws detection filters (SDB filters). thus, the first set can be synthesized, not the entire text order. this allows you to skip or pause jobs on the map tab, even if the voice synthesizer does not directly support it.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the Statutes recognition filter. at the first start of & down; as default, a set level recognition filter is automatically set up. you can change its settings or add more sentence detection filters, but beginners will be discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn is to set up the speaker selection by trying out. turn on the speaker selection and enter text to read. check the list of speakers, which speaker & ktts; switch on the speaker selection again, change some properties and check how the speaker selection changes. you must of course have more than one speaker installed, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktops; then can start faster with the first set, since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">If the voice synthesizer does not support this function, you can pause or abort orders on the card holder.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set identifier filter is automatically set up if you start dictatmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, only removed. do not change anything in this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">A punctuation filter comparing text with a regular expression for punctuation and inserting a tab character (decimal code 8) at the bylaws (tab characters are automatically removed from the text prior to the filter).</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; -messages (cmp), warnings, messages or the output of screen reaers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed from see the normal code recognition filter, you can insert it again by uploading the file standard _ sbdrc contained in & down.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the Speaker Selection tab, you can override the speaker settings for the application.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top on the card holder). in other words: no speaker properties are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use the most appropriate speaker, which has all the features of a built-in speaker. if you do not delete or edit the speaker's settings, select & ctuts; otherwise select & ctuts; the speaker that best matches the originally set properties.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select here the properties of the desired speaker. if this feature does not matter, enter nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this check box if the property should have precedence over other features. you can also set multiple markers here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output, it is always treated as the priority feature. you will rarely use this feature. the only case you may want to specify the language attribute is when you know that a particular application will be sent text in another language than the one set in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the properties in the field spokesman, which is most likely to delete the following, click the default speaker on the selection button and then use the speaker that is closest to the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 stands for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify a job number. (without order number the input is 0).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Ttsmgr crashes when it is started. I compiled debug support, but I don't get back tracking.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crash and ktops; it has ended. probably you need to register GStreamer. if the problem is not solved by this, an uncompatible version of GStreamer is installed. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output about ALSA does not work if I play music at the same time with another application. if I stop a text order, it freezes & down; a. on the & console; a message appears that says: Unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system there is the problem that conflicts occur at ALSA, which prevent the simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. you can find hints for possible solutions on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I have uploaded an additional voice for festival from the internet. I installed it and can use it in festival, but ktesmgr doesn't display this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / ktesd / festivalue / vocals, add the new voice. as a guide, you can use the other entries. if this is successful, please send a patch along with the & URL; on which you have found the voice, to the developer.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the audio card audio, there is a setting speed. for this to work, the program must be installed sox and searchable via the PATH environment variable. some synthesizermodules like Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed even on the map tab for speaker setup. depending on the selected voice, this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The speaking speed settings are ignored when & down; & HTML; reads. (this is because the HTML is converted to SSML.) disable either the filter for the conversion of & HTML; (see) or, if you are quite brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after-SSML Converter, and set up the speaking speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't make it that websites are read with a female voice. I have set up a female festival speaker, but & dictts; reads the websites with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta the tag Sable GENDER does not seem to work. so that festival does not produce any errors, the xsl file accuses to convert from SSML to Saber the GENDER tags. the same applies to the VOICE-tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added a custom character set filter and now I can go in & down; no more to proceed or go back. on the tab order it is displayed, the order consists only of one set. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">Punctuation marks (dot, question mark, exclamation mark, comma and semicolon) must not be filtered. instead use a filter for the number of punctuation for these characters.</seg>
<seg id="2757">Alsa (Advanced & Linux; Sound Architecture). Alsa is on most systems with & Linux; already installed. (www.alsa-project.org)</seg>
<seg id="2758">GStreamer in version 0.8.7 or later. note: make sure the modules are registered for GStreamer by calling the follow-register before using GStreamer. (HTTP: / / gstreamer .freedesktop.org)</seg>
<seg id="2759">Some users are experiencing conflicts with the audio output in connection with ALSA. if your system is also included, you can't play music at the same time and read a text at the same time. it also freezes if you stop a text order and then start another. you can find possible solutions for this problem on the ALSA (dmix) website.</seg>
<seg id="2760">As of July 2005, aKode does not support any real breaks. if you hold a text order in & down, the current set will still be read.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The audio program sox is used for the general setting of the speech speed, but is not necessarily required. Debian users can sox install the command apt-get install sox. the program is included on most & Linux; -CDs already.</seg>
<seg id="2762">Have you downloaded and tar; as tarball (with tar packet archive), login as normal user and unzip the tarball to a suitable folder. change to this folder and enter the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2763">In & kde; 4 the module & arts; probably removed or at least only created on request.</seg>
<seg id="2764">The following modules for voice synthesizers are created by default. some of them have a running time dependency on non-free software. (non-free according to the Debian distribution guidelines).</seg>
<seg id="2765">As default, & ktts; installed in / opt / kde3. if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $KDEDIRS, you must specify --prefix = target as an option.</seg>

<seg id="2768">Before you start, make sure your voice synthesizer works properly. follow the instructions that you received with the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizers whose source code is open. the quality of the voices is generally good, and there are several voices and languages supported.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You need to install at least one language. help can be found in the instructions supplied with festival. if you want to read websites, you need to install the (male British) voice rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices, you need to compile an additional module, so you need the source code of the festival. German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This voice requires Festival 1.95 beta or newer. the voice is still in an early stage of development. unpack the software in festival / lib / vocals / russian /. if you set up the Russian voices, you must enter for the voices MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone. select a cyrillic (8-bit) encoding as for example koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2773">Festival is usually included in the Linux distributions. therefore, search the festival first on the CDs of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2774">If you want to use Polish, Hungarian or Czech language, the encoding option must be set to ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2775">If you want to use the Russian voice, the encoding option must be set to an 8-bit Cyrillic like koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2776">Festival can be used together with the & MBROLA; then festival takes over the lexikalische analytical and & MBROLA; generates the audio output. the & MBROLA; program and the & MBROLA; voices can be downloaded from</seg>
<seg id="2777">Note that & MBROLA; not a complete language output system. & MBROLA; generates language from phone files. you need additional software to create this phone.

<seg id="2778">In this procedure, additional wrapper code is added to Festival to use & MBROLA; voices to voice synthesis. note that the & MBROLA; voice files are not installed in & MBROLA; folders but in the festival / lib /. manuals can be found at:</seg>
<seg id="2779">IMS German Festival is a modified version of Festival for German & MBROLA; voices. required is either Festival version 1.4.1 or Festival 2.0 (1.95beta). first install festival and & MBROLA; then download MS German Festival from</seg>
<seg id="2780">Instructions can be found in the README file in the package that you have downloaded.

<seg id="2794">Start dicttmsgr. click Add. select the Czech or Slovak language and epic TTS voice synthesizer. if the epos programs are not in your PATH, enter the path to the programs on the card holder. enter in a & konsole; epos -h or say -h to obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="2795">FreeTTS is a free, source language synthesizer written in & Java, i.e. you must install the & Java; Virtual Machine on your system. with & Java; you can adjust neither pitch, volume nor speaking speed.</seg>
<seg id="2796">The command module allows you to use & tts; with any voice synthesizer located in a console; it can be controlled on the command line.</seg>
<seg id="2797">It is best to use a command that writes the voice output into a temporary audio file (wav) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device</seg>
<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; allowing management of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings through a uniform, integrated interface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be invoked by selecting K Menu _ controlcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; the areas of & knetworkconf; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module will be displayed in & kcontrolcenter; the network settings module (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & network network settings in & KMenu; started.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware is not able to install. physical devices and their drivers must be installed and configured already, so that & knetwork.com; the device at all indicates and allows setting of network features.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed when installing and installing Linux. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network settings module will be loaded when the network settings option in & kcontrolcenter; -Index is selected. when the module's network settings are started, this will automatically detect the platform used on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the manual selection is offered. it is possible to select the platform from the list that best matches the distribution and release date. by selecting the setting Not-again, the definition can be made permanently. at the next start of the network settings, this selection is automatically preset.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. previously, all options are gray, which means that the settings can only be considered, changing is not possible. in the system management mode, you enter system management mode at the right lower end of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. this is divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The Network Interface Manager is used to manage network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be performed by the network interfaces:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button... Setting up in the dialog device.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the option Automatically, the TCP / IP settings are fetched from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings for the system are performed simultaneously with the start of the system services. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all the necessary TCP / IP information at every system start, therefore no further setting is required. in the selective list, either DHCP or BOOTP server can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the option Manually the TCP / IP configuration can be done without DHCP or BOOTP. in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address needs to be specified. in the input field network mask the subnet mask must be set.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface when booting. if initialization is undesirable, this option should not be enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address on the network is not already used. entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & console, you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or disabled as needed. switching on an outdated network device is activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or disabled as needed. disable an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on Interface...</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the host's IP address on the local subnet, which communicates the physical link to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communications with hosts in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers only request IP addresses. if the machine requests http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS resolves this name to an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution calculator part of the name resolution allows simple management of this list. entries can be added, removed or changed .DNS entries can be sorted by selecting an entry and listing or downgrading in the list using the Hinder or Herunder buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the Add... from the group calculator to the name resolution, a DNS server can be added. it will display the New Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First, enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry will then be added to the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator to the name resolution, select an entry and then click the Edit button.... it will display the Edit dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list named in particular describes hostname-to-IP address references for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used when booting when no DNS servers are available. in small, remote networks it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Usually the list contains some entries, the & apos; localhostapos; and support some special IPv6 addresses. this still in the test version of IP is to replace version 4 in future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known machine and click Add... Add the New Alias dialog will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button. if the known computer has several alias names, press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a particular known computer from the list and select Edit.... The Modified Calculator will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be done one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the network settings are not effective immediately in the system. to enable the changes, the following command needs to be set.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (mostly rpm packages) it is sufficient if & kde; and Qt installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a graphical interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of your distribution can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is not sufficient; in addition, the development packages are needed with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only to experienced users, but it is not difficult to compile and compile. the following commands should do so.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic networking technology will be given, and in the second section all of & knetworkconf will be discussed; variable configuration files will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small (home) network is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently being run using TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv6 never found widespread dissemination. IPv6 is expected to continue in the near future. this description is currently focused on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is. in third-party networks, on & eg; Workplace, the network administrator is the contact point that addresses a valid IP address or if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address cannot be simply chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up your own small (home) network, the IP address should be chosen from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, therefore any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateway.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses are usually used in the range 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">Additionally, the netmask is set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0bridge; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = the own computer). the default route is required for IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to a so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part, the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf are affected and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections, so it won't be surprised if there is a different content than specified in the case of active DSL links.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another stand as expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar, which furthermore offered the ability of dds2tar for fast, selective unpacking.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used it has to be mounted from & kdat; this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; cots the tape back and reads the prestressing information of the tape. recognize & kdat; don't recognize the foreplay on the tape, you will be asked if the tape is to be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognizes and kdat; the credits, it searches for the appropriate index on your disk. if this cannot be found, you will be asked if the band index is to be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the icon for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been integrated. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the volume of the tape can now be searched by tabs of the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; by changing the symbol for the tape to recognize that the integration for the tape has been released and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the tape can now be ejected without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band can be used by & kdat; it must be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band type must be formatted before you can be used to store data. this process does not correspond to formatting at & kdat; this process does not correspond to formatting at & kdat; this does happen before you can be formatted by the tape of & kdat; floppy disk drives usually require a formatting of the tape, but DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the tape name and capacity, & kdat; with the format of the tape fort. all data on the tape is lost! after completion of the formatting process, the tape is integrated automatically and is ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you set up the backup process, you must select the files to be secured. this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. it will only backup this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are backed up.</seg>

<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the backup appears. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process, including data rate and time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. it will only check the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a check box. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click on any of the archives and select the menu item Check....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the scan process has been started, the dialog appears for checking. in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for the check.</seg>

<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re-create the band index file based on the band content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index on two types of the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a security profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current job folder where the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured will be automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders that are listed in backup files, only the files in it are backed up to the same file system as the folder. folders that are on other filesystems can be entered separately in backup files. each entry is considered by tar independently of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">To determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; & lt; lt; files were not fully implemented at the time of creation of this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set the settings through the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the tape drive (normally / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding variant of the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2931">This setting is active, transmits, and kdat; before the tape is inserted, the command inhibits load to the drive. in some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is enabled, try & kdat; to block the ejection of the tape drive. this setting may not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is enabled, the release of & kdat; automatically ejected the band. do not use this option with Floppy-Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, it will try to change the hardware side block size for the tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you must inform & kdat; in any case you will need to tell the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a tape is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">The format of this string is hostname: seconds, where hostname is the full name of the system on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time in which the tape has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band id is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The rest of the files on the tape are bare nectar archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incremental backups.</seg>

<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and will be explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog; features for filtering and sorting the single protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After startup, & ksystemlog; first, the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - is not displayed to you, and it opens itself instead of a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; very probably not with system administrator privileges. the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the / var / log, for which normal users usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion or after entered strings. the list of the protocol lines is now automatically changed, so that only the protocol lines will be displayed that match the selected filter. in the default setting, a protocol line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term will then only be matched to the entries in the corresponding column. for example, in the protocol file system log, select the process column, and also enter the name of a process in the filter bar, so show you & ksystemlog; all the protocol lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. level errors are displayed with a more conspicuous color than the minutes lines of the level hint.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you just want to display a specific process (for example in the system log or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. for example, this can be useful if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as for example to start the Samba server. in this case, you can use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can use the Add to new line option in the main window context menu to view all new incoming protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; enables the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub-windows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log to display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. You can find more up-to-date information on the supply sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; you can also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and named as named) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init quickly becomes the standard for controlling the program start when booting the system in the & Linux world. this is because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc This is important because maybe someone could try to convert a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and reformatting. the & Linux; kernel looks first under / etc after an init file. therefore, you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The sysV init differs also from the BSD init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is rc.d. dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following other folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for every system service that you want to boot when booting the system or when switching to another runlevel. system services include such things as setserial, which will only be started once. such calls are rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be in / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file even if there is not much use for it. you can also set up a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port when you boot up.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches in different places after the program init and starts the first one finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following in the initial area:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have messed up something then you can fix it by reboot the system and run the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the correct scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d then you'll probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no proper files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument such as start and stop. you can actually start these scripts manually on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script is called stop using the argument. if it contains an S, the script will be invoked with the start argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server runlevel that only httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc; run. in addition, I could also have a user runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult, because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six Runtime to start (or stop it).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runstitn or change the position within a level by removing it somewhere else. this will only remove the entry from its original runlevel (or its position). this will not happen only if they extract an entry from the area of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved if you drag them to a new area. to merely copy them to a new Runtime level, you must explicitly copy from the Edit menu or from the contextual menu and paste it into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try to insert the system service again.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there is currently no way to restore entries that were thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the Tab key to activate the different fields of work (available system services, Runtime 1 Start, Runtime 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry to another runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl + V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or name of an entry manually, press the Enter key to open the Properties dialog. use the Tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. pre-settings are recovered to the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they will be restored by & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard runleveling, and now the machine is restarting constantly. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single-user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; to run under runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you will need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please refer to the distribution manual for details.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions, simplifies configuration for the proprietary set-up programs of these distributions but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution: please check that all the configuration files are required by the respective system service (and whether they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) simply end up without notice if their configuration files are not present or incorrectly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of & Linux; -Runtime varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use a different distribution, please send me information about the runtime to be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter customization of & kuser;.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Once you have made changes, you need to save it. you can either use the toolbar icon or the Save In the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two flashcards, user and user group list. to edit, select the user or the desired group by double-clicking on the entry.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings. only when you have enabled space limitations (quota) for users, a card card will be created on which you can make individual settings. other flashcards appear if Shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd are installed in BSD UNIX.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The tab card password management appears if Shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card only appears if for at least one embedded filesystem space limitation (quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable by the file quota user / quota.group on the file system).</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be individually set for each file system. the current file system is selected by means of the field filesystem with space limitation</seg>
<seg id="2997">The Groups tab informs about the group affiliations of the selected user. the default group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the Primary Group field. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog properties of the group includes a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the user or group or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or the selected group works analogously.</seg>
<seg id="3000">This module allows you to install the lilo boot manager, add, remove and modify the boot password, change the time to boot the default operating system, add, remove, modify, modify, delete, modify, and more.</seg>
