although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American authors and operated his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , how he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can L@@ etter , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , uncovered the mur@@ der@@ ous plot of an oil magn@@ ate , who wanted to occupy the top Federal Court with judges who were inclined to his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free after Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was as if it was the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona was only exac@@ erb@@ ated by my admir@@ ation for the USA .
I always said , &quot; America is the only country I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even wrote a very black@@ ish love letter about his great@@ ness .
then came Donald Tr@@ ump .
much was written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how to deal with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never thinks behind the mountain , as you say so beautifully .
he tells us exactly what he thinks like a former colleague , and publicly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , the people responded to his statements and voted for him in dro@@ ves .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can pre @-@ election was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever reached .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ?
I couldn &apos;t reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time .
for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , which receives people from all over the world , a deeply dev@@ out person with whom I could talk about Islam and its past .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Wel@@ tan@@ schau@@ ung did not agree with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ um@@ ps intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who struggles for her life for the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
she still fits to the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with patience and grace to me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise counsel helped me much in my career .
these people and the values represented by them deep@@ ened my love of America .
while Tr@@ ump made his way to the nominated Republi@@ can Pres@@ idential Candi@@ date , they offered me a hold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
it turned out , however , that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly wh@@ ites , gave the presi@@ dency to a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the confrontation with the idea that people voted for tr@@ ump , because they shared either rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump voters as ra@@ cists .
to classi@@ fy the people , one of my friends said , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and implies an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their worries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that those voters , most of them know , voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to regain control of a country that disappointed them ?
in other words , they might say they are still important in America ?
maybe .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comm@@ its the cruel decision to raise a man looking down with cont@@ emp@@ t upon those who look different from him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( note : white against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; white and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; skull trauma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) as the great Van Jones described has killed exactly what America has made so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever faith or background one may have , America welcomes everyone .
for this country , as its president , twice elected the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history , as he says himself , would nowhere else be possible in the world .
with the election of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , a huge part of America &apos;s white America promises this promise and says : hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the helm , they say .
in all this I have to think about K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried , and their voices became lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would anyone , who is not like you , have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , this is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the country for which his son had fallen , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ um@@ ps Land , said the news .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan could not find a place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

out of the misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love of music by rub@@ b@@ ish
the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .
image of Fli@@ ck@@ r user O@@ EA @-@ O@@ AS ( CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 ) .
what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca together with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura in common ?
the fact that the music played in both places has not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close relationship with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , just 16 kilometers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; an old colonial town which is very popular among tourists - but worlds apart from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music ban@@ des ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding it with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 pupils has become a central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its abuse of drugs and the gangs of gangs .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who launched a musical project and offered the youth a rare hope of hope .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Noti@@ ci@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come out of school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come and play with shiny eyes and play in the bu@@ stle you learn day for day trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , wood@@ horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga to play .
music from Tr@@ ash
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is located on the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in Paraguay &apos;s capital - play instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ worked instruments consisting of local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers under the direction of Fa@@ vio Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez have begun to transform parts of the waste into instruments .
the instruments mim@@ ic viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums , all of which were made of rub@@ b@@ ish .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article by the Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez , a local econom@@ ist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the early days :
first it was very difficult because we had no room to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the tr@@ ash . the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children .
this changed when Fa@@ vio was shown something he had never seen before : a violin produced from rub@@ b@@ ish .
today there is a whole orchestra playing instruments made of recycled material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentary called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic land@@ fill pon@@ ie ) records the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world generates about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish each year .
those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring performance of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra has even played music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries demonstrate how technology and team work can successfully combat illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that fights illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , practi@@ sed solutions for environmental problems .
re @-@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for joint use of content .
in West Africa , it was known then that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia waters before it visited the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind on their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ es , Moz@@ ambique and the Seych@@ elles quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to give him a permit of fishing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at the time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region : it was not successful for him to catch fish there .
in the end , it was also forced to pay $ 2 million in Liberia for pil@@ lage of the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries established in 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing .
the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries that had then expelled the prime ministers from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and support each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , director of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden why it is extremely difficult to detect . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing in regions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the deliber@@ ate violation of existing laws , through which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can damage ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the sn@@ ail &apos;s pace , with which information circul@@ ated between individual countries , the actions happen today in real time , with trace@@ able to F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about suspi@@ cious activities or details that one notices or experienced during a harbour inspection .
fish @-@ i also very atten@@ tively pursu@@ es the activities of ships when they move on the open lake using satellite data .
this allows the authorities to flag ships that fish in forbidden areas . also , suspi@@ cious cycling routes can be discovered , such as those suggest@@ ing that a ship invites his caught fish to other ships on the way .
ideally , such studies can show whether the involved vessels have a fishing license , where they were on the road and whether they have a criminal .
countries that are opposed to illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports on the basis of this information . which means that ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there are significant financial losses for the owner , which means illegal fishing is no longer financially worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting company committed to fight illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue , which the eight members of the H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network lose each year due to the illegal fishermen who enter into East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries in which the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also the same illegal fishing fishermen .
their practices include , among other things , actions such as sailing under false flag , fake license papers , nam@@ ing of f@@ anci@@ ful names , fish protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately take advantage of the lack of international co @-@ operation and make use of the weaknesses of an un@@ seamlessly organized control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t run my port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now , the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspi@@ cious vessels .
it has uncovered criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used multiple frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has tra@@ cked and found fle@@ eing ships .
due to its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system that will help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evolving , also helps to detect the illegal ships that like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishing practices use highly sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fisheries data and provides technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , so that they can no longer be ordered from satellites .
Cop@@ eland therefore helps build a system that links different levels of information . F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i is to help to find criminal vessels with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations really influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch together with Google and the Oce@@ ana Marine Protection Agency : a platform that provides satellite data and by which the position of each trac@@ table ship can be displayed globally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbors , to get a better picture of who is doing what - it simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and pool their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts has a similar project in which a global system allows the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only det@@ rac@@ ted criminals but also deter them .
ships that had formerly been f@@ ished without a license and barely expected to expect consequences , now know that they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now have a 33 % increase in fishing sales since fishing boats buy more licenses .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped to detect Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found tow@@ ing nets where they were banned .
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars annually disappear by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 six countries joined together , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are now fighting illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security is the goal to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s latest member state Somalia was able to declare its first major triumph : in October , it launched Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under false flag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters , which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a special , collaborative approach to protecting the oceans really works across the world sea .

street movements in Venezuela appear to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they act as a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro &apos;s im@@ pe@@ achment .
this picture of MarÃ­a Ale@@ j@@ andra Mor@@ a shows a close @-@ up of the demonstration in Mar@@ ac@@ ai@@ bo in 2014 .

after the government of Venezuela had rejected the proposal of the opposition to a referendum on rec@@ u@@ per@@ ation , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into empt@@ iness by le@@ aning on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the re@@ funds of Venezuela ) , both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments can be found for and against them .
the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - including in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ de@@ an Region of MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a , in the centrally located Bun@@ de@@ staat , Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country continues to deterior@@ ate , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medication .
many representatives of the opposition saw in the im@@ pe@@ achment of the current President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro the chance of a fundamental change ; but ultimately , the sec@@ rec@@ y of a new election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , Con@@ tri@@ but@@ ors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ises in their latest article the context of the government decision as follows :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis , where inflation and violence rates are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum was considered the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ Ã¡@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( approximately : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined together , called for a mass rally to support the National Assembly on October 27 , as well as a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an seat of government , to continue blocking the referendum on rec@@ u@@ per@@ ation .
the call was commented on Twitter among other things as follows :
it is so far Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday national civil strike and on 3 November all after Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace .

&quot; the re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot;
the first demonstration in the framework of the action programme &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October .
the pictures of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most common images shows a demonstr@@ ator calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I &apos;m hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cried this Venezu@@ el@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter images that tell of arguments are accum@@ ulating , as well as reports of oppression and abuse .
especially big waves struck the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own testimony against the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a do not wear coats because otherwise you could see something that many National Gu@@ ards have not !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic already makes the round , which forms the scale of oppression a day :
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the call for a legislative process - it has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .
added to My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of signatures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your removal of power !
on the road !
others evaluate those protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which from their point of view has taken little action against the disa@@ strous economic crisis and is rather busy making critical voices silent :
they took us so much - but also fear !
mar@@ ches are increasing frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike , instead of working or shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ Ã³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news page .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to take a look at the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city of CÃ³r@@ doba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now said in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of CÃ³r@@ doba against his father .
the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , investigated crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations at La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the family secret for himself .
in the situation at that time I believed that it was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not recognize that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer and a mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was gendar@@ mer@@ ie official . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the intelligence department , 141 at La Per@@ la prison .

but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who was accused of kidn@@ apping in 15@@ 8 cases of torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of the atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows the great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started taking me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall with us . there I was friend of a boy who made martial arts .
everyone called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you made yourself friends with one of the ERP .
pass only that they will not kid@@ nap you one day and I have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for Ej@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Argent@@ inian Revolutionary Workers Party .
that is why he prohibited me from going into the sports hall again . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it was fine .
at the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all sorts of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything .

on the other hand , the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a barracks , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small package wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen items were put off and stopped me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured there .
I pe@@ ered in and saw a couch being tor@@ tured on men .
she looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they fast@@ ened that one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who had just tied up there .
she un@@ le@@ ashed a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it with water and drove him a load of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was app@@ alling ... like a dirty whi@@ rl@@ wind .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I immediately recognized the smell and it became clear to me that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it possible that a human being can do so much harm to another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were hand@@ cu@@ ffed with cu@@ ffs and band@@ ages .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying down with the face - all were tied at hands and feet .
near the entrance , people cau@@ ze quietly on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me here ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me about it .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man there and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to the testimony of survivors , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process , was beaten by the student Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came here is also the way on which the kidn@@ apped came here .
if you look at the map , you will see that they took about this path and were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the de@@ human@@ isation process .
if they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order came from above that they were to be reloc@@ ated .
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; boot@@ y &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things home .
at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; boot@@ y &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was at the military later , - I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war boot@@ y is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps a military sign that one takes away from an enemy that has been fought .

but if one goes into a house and the fridge , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then this is not a war boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; And you who drove cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded with anger , struck me and scre@@ amed :
if you go so far , I will find you and kill you with your own hands .
we don &apos;t need anybody else to do so !
so was my father .
I have no good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photograph of then , on which I wore a jacket and a pul@@ lover from wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought home clothes .
at that time , the defense accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can burden me what they wanted .
I was there anyway to say .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of corp@@ ses is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &apos;
now that I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you have executed people during the dictatorship , but why do the corp@@ ses disappear ?
why kid@@ nap children ?
one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
it would have been easy to put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why their corp@@ ses disappear ?
did these people not have families to whom one could pass their mortal remains ?
the enforced disappearance of corp@@ ses is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that one can do to a human being .
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they took machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course there is always something .
&apos;@@ i have seen how you killed men ! &apos;
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
the idea of showing my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I was repro@@ ached for all the atro@@ cities I had to experience because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have killed anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly rep@@ elled and asked why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; they supposedly defended were actually good .
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something like that ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you committed terrible crimes and forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he only replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , then show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 I made the first advertisement .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can blame me for being bi@@ ased . I have finally put out against my own father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest pending before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 counts : including serious , illegal de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 15@@ 8 cases , torture in 15@@ 4 cases , murder in 98 cases , torture followed by death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years of age .

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ au@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ om@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers in Spanish to the magnitude of the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
43 complain@@ ants were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases the court sentenced him to life imprisonment and in nine cases prison sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the 54 defend@@ ants had died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ verdict : murder , torture and rape by officers .
all the accused were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police and civilian employees .
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped and brought to La Per@@ la together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 .
he addressed the following words to the silent Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human minds .
the verdict is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations that have worked for years on justice for the victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine@@ an organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , representing the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the process took more than three years , but the research for this took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the land on which La Per@@ la was located in order to build a memorial that is now being run by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; translation errors make older people in Kyoto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful driving &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto where you can pro@@ long your driving license .

edited the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in Kyoto &apos;s Japanese city , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long his driving license have witnessed a particularly mis@@ guided translation last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older motor@@ ist &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older motor@@ ist &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; was wrong@@ ly translated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terri@@ fic mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building , from 1 to 20 September .
editing of original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , widely shared in social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , which was published in K@@ YO@@ TO , wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to older people and in an international city as Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the English translation was first removed . the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was replaced later by the more appropriate , albeit gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture exc@@ used for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely feel that elderly people were offen@@ ded by the inadequate correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News dealt with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers involved in accidents across the country is quite a cause for concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 deaths were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 , representing a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , senior citizens created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of 11,@@ 850 accidents altogether .
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen in the same period .
the particularly un@@ named repor@@ ter brought comments to light in the version of the article published on Yahoo , which show which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently he@@ el against older drivers :
the article on the translation error has among other things received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is that ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about not reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How er@@ ron@@ eous is the translation not at all , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot;
there are not very few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre errors in English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the widespread distribution of translation errors are manifold .
to translate , you need two important skills : passive language skills , in order to understand the basic text and to acquire active language skills in order to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators in the target language should not be in the initial language - native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English to French - not from French to English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their native language , which could translate translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of the translation , cost foundation or the relatively low number of native English @-@ speaking native speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies , who do not have foreign employees themselves , can still make translations in @-@ house . then the Japanese worker , whose English skills are rated as the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widespread - often with funny results .
the confused and en@@ ig@@ matic phrases that arise by machine translation indicate that this technique cannot be replaced by any human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling im@@ prints that often decorate t @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery , but by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards , more careful translations can be expected .
in the future , the Kyoto City will hopefully use a rep@@ utable source for their translations .
Venezuela : taking protests and cens@@ orship on the Internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar of Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users announced that they had no access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online channel .
later , other users wrote that the internet appearances of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ o@@ lio TV were no longer accessible .
other online stations also recorded recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups that oppose the government Nicol@@ Ã¡s Ma@@ du@@ ros .
the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and deleg@@ ated the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was app@@ ended and recommended the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# cens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that the Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet pages are once again locked .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
tours like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been reluct@@ ant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for T@@ elecommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations because the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national television channels I have registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
it is astonishing that this is still more favourable than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible due to a blocking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly ren@@ ders its meetings .
earlier research by the Institute of Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had revealed that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS servers answer requests of certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server responds poorly or denied the request when calling such a website .
we confirm a DNA lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
in V@@ PI@@ TV , a third blocked channel , the broadcast was dis@@ continued on Thursday , 6 April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera man El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was det@@ ained .
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV was on air again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it is also reported that the government regul@@ ates internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ an access to multi @-@ media coverage of the current events in the country more difficult .
in Paraguay a lot of girls become slaves to receive training
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ m@@ son as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today , T@@ ina struggles for the rights of children and ga@@ thers witness testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ mean tas , who have been victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report of structural , published by Global Vo@@ ices with kindly permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en , &quot; which is edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one who has become something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she became ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ tas , in Paraguay the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers their under@@ age son or her minor daughter to another more rich family . in exchange , the child gets food , an apprenticeship and a roof over the head .
but what is not mentioned here is that the children will have to spend countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a treaty that cannot be raised .
this practice called Cri@@ mean is widespread in Paraguay because of its participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for some years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ mean - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Cri@@ mean az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ oun@@ cing them .
she tried to name things by name , because the feeling of gratitude which is ino@@ cul@@ ated by the cri@@ p@@ adi is generally not silent .
&quot; the Cri@@ mean az@@ go is based on a double del@@ usion , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ nar@@ a .
on the one hand , the family , whose daughter is in the belief that she can thus complete her education , improve her position in society and &quot; make something out of herself , &quot; is handed over to another family .
on the other hand , the family who takes the girl with her and justi@@ fies its exploitation with the belief that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and maybe even star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ mean
when the girl gets mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will learn about it many years later .
sometimes they even never know about it .
in January 2016 the so far unknown phenomenon happened , which takes place in the hidden in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n was hospit@@ alized in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body found traces of violent be@@ atings . shortly thereafter she died .
she was 14 years old .
it was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the budget of the former military @-@ member Tom@@ Ã¡s F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their home in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
at the end of January 2016 , F@@ errei@@ ra hit Mar@@ Ã­n as long as she suffered le@@ thal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela took responsibility for the death of the girl who was deeply rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they designated the Cri@@ mean az@@ go as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay could give .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered than children , &quot; lam@@ ented T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without documents it is much easier to un@@ punished un@@ punished children &apos;s rights .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations demanded swift investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be trend @-@ setting - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ mean az@@ go comes in court .
the daily life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as labour forces , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , in which her father worked , had to sign up bankrupt@@ cy and her father lost his work .
their brothers now had to work and began to sell sweets on the street or on the market to make money .
but they all went further to school .
only T@@ ina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
in the home of her employers , Al@@ var@@ den@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
she had to divide the time in such a way that she was still time to learn .
she rose up at five o &apos;clock every morning and prepared breakfast for her employers .
on Fri@@ days , for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more she was done with learning , the more free time she had .
but even this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but also didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was allowed to fetch more books from the house@@ wife &apos;s library than food from the fridge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she recalls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 , belonged to the opposition .
at some evenings the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand next to him and read edi@@ tori@@ als from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince them not to believe the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he thought she was intelligent , but did not stay with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the master had found someone who listened while talking about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they thought that I would learn &quot; bad habits &quot; there again . &quot; so they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ , would return home to their native language Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ .
their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had enabled her to lose again , she explains .
however , she was perfectly clear that she had paid for everything she got from her with her hard work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also at school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a thing about which is almost never spoken is bul@@ lying and har@@ ass@@ ment to which Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exposed when they go to school . &quot; &quot; &quot;

I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to go home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .

the society endor@@ ses the Cri@@ mean
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , in which one can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and pa@@ edi@@ atri@@ cians in Paraguay .
the group &apos;s administration is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ Ã³n district .
hello ! I am looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please report to you .
beginning from Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the place Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had an eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman , who also came out of Ã@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the third comment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the hear@@ tland that wants to work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was written . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the advertis@@ ment of the ad was once again switched on :
dear friends , I found one . I see if it works with her .
thank you , I write again if something is .
the business was complete .

in the course of our history we managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the Early History of Paraguay ) , where the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the wives of the Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ had to pay tribute and Spanish in@@ doctr@@ ination . therefore , it is not to be justified that many girls and boys go into a system of slavery in which they become light victims of abuse and exploitation .
social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the display of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ mean az@@ go .
bill authori@@ zes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
image of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , changed by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian MPs have recently approved a draft bill on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regulating the use and usage of social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it is adopted by Parliament , users of social media in Egypt must be registered by a government agency to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , there would be a place appointed to give citizens permission to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months of adoption of the law , users must register on the site of the site with their correct names and identity numbers to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months of imprisonment or a fine of money .
the bill , which consists of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ ses in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice , video news and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is adopted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should lay down the registration . it is unclear how they should account for those who do not register considering the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , MP and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and got a user name and password from the ministry of telecommunications to get through the fire@@ wall blocking Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to establish a fire@@ wall at national level around Facebook . because of which it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network .
but it is not yet known that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; Senior research scientist &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I strongly doubt the technical capacity and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they could be violent physical public and private rooms , it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously , it means they will set up a strong monitoring system to filter out citizens who seek approval or not . and that means a mad system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to lead them to a court case .
technically , this is by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the Parliament &apos;s legislature and the constitutional committees before it comes to the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether his acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not , the draft &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in the parliament , in whose sense the control will be maxim@@ ized and ensure that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the screen , &quot; says Ra@@ o of .
last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a legal action against cy@@ ber crime , in which a life @-@ long prison sentence was intended for those found guilty of threatening &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest &quot; to protest .

high up in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal prot@@ ector H@@ ana Ah@@ med Raz@@ a and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the larger family of the le@@ op@@ ards that strike through Africa and Asia belongs to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus ) . altogether , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered because of po@@ aching , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat .
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem will also depend on a large pre@@ dat@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is small and goes against zero . so when the team found in the video that they have a record of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in sheer delight .
as a trained bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a passion@@ ately likes to show another side of her country , which is not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
since 2013 , she has been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to ensuring that protection zones for wildlife in the Kur@@ dist@@ an region are set up .

at the beginning of March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for nor@@ theastern Japan , documented the progress achieved over the past six years in order to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an nuclear accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had spark@@ ed the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture was an et@@ tish pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami resulting from it .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring coun@@ ties Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forci@@ bly evacu@@ ated , as the ts@@ un@@ ami had left whole coastal towns away from the map .
the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture still experienced a nuclear accident , and that is why 160@@ ,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows , from a local point of view , what progress has been achieved six years after to rebuild the life of the local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of those concerned themselves .
the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses were completed in the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to see the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , where 80 per cent of the planned replacement houses were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of these houses while Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light with 70 percent .
however , even six years after the disaster , evacu@@ ated from temporary accommodation ( in the Netherlands , in the Cau@@ cas@@ us ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) , evacu@@ ated to final replacement houses .
after the triple disaster nearly 80@@ ,000 people saw themselves forced to live in temporary shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such dwell@@ ings .
almost 40 percent of the evacu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma evacu@@ ated in 2011 are still living in emergency shel@@ ters , while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful here . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ees were evacu@@ ated to final homes after the disaster .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure here is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , who were affected by mis@@ fortune , opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resum@@ ed their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident have largely affected agricultural land in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , where only 66 per cent of the farm@@ land can be re @-@ used in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 per cent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farm@@ land from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are in the &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far beaten back .
the number of tourists in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate is again up to 90 percent at the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only show 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal dw@@ ellers , it is more difficult to earn their living .
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to be able to determine the overall picture , the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacu@@ ates . she questioned her about the state of reconstruction and also how her emp@@ athy has changed against the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction to the article K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to find out more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents had taken steps to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those surv@@ eyed said that there has still not been enough in cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es prevention .
as it is about those who had to evacu@@ ate from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacu@@ ated people from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to witness not only the enormous earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed .
from 160 000 evacu@@ ated people from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in early 2016 , some more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , had been res@@ ett@@ led in permanent replacement houses .
after the state of 2017 there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas , most of the evacu@@ ates still live in homes are older than 50 years old . it is well known that the efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma will have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when we meet people from other countries who speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater at first than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one often sees that one connects more than it seems at first glance .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast , we address topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone beyond language and country borders .
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities between Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i Hoff@@ man explains how the love of music has overcome the lack of common language skills during a trip in rural China ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time she worked with people from all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being beaten up by the police in national demonstrations

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva at a widespread photograph .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer had beaten him against the head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity measures .
Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on him on this Saturday and now transferred him to an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which rapidly spread within a few days quickly in Brazil .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer , who attacked with a bat@@ on . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s claimed that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended from active service until the investigation of the incident .
the pictures show the police officer how he strikes at Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his bat@@ on on the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed in the intensive care unit , his face would be seen on television for six months and the whole repression would justify it .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel by media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the web in which one can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and shortly thereafter .
another video with the same scenes , filmed from a different perspective , is also sub@@ merged in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users now donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( approximately 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover a portion of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while lying in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado invites further violent attacks against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s :
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s is experiencing a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was killed by his father because he supported the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , the military police of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App group had joined a gas leak . and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who has been attacked by a polic@@ eman who has hit him with a stick .
police hand@@ over
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s is not the only country in Brazil where brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators last Friday took place last Friday .
at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , police officers set up a stage for or@@ ators , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
the deputy Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Pe@@ ac@@ eful Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to refrain from violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements .
this includes a report in Tor@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media have tu@@ cked road protests by directing the focus on another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
the Tor@@ ah de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were specifically reporting on a broken glass window in order to illustrate their front pages illustr@@ atively with a photo .
on the other hand , O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window screen than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly against any form of damage .
here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; ob@@ tains an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate importance , and the typical atro@@ cities of the military police are obsc@@ ured by the head@@ lines entitled &quot; demonstr@@ ators on confrontation with the police . &quot;
Cuba &apos;s Un@@ char@@ ted Villa@@ ges in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , hundreds of sugar cane plants in all of Cuba included doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the community of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is widely known as the Central - in Spanish Su@@ gar Mill , not@@ withstanding the fact that there is no appreci@@ able sugar harvest on site .
it was two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane mills were paraly@@ sed .
after succ@@ eeding , the sugar cane industry in the region stood still , and the plant gradually lost its machinery , until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained .
approximately 27@@ 2 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ ign and commu@@ te to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier &apos;s veter@@ an , who rises every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which after a long period of in@@ active time are back in operation , because they have been preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene re@@ members exactly that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the amount produced in 1910 .
the message would have been a motive for calm for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no longer a novel@@ ty .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old platform of the church already saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the com@@ min@@ ution of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane mills were technically obsol@@ ete and hardly competitive they became unbe@@ ar@@ able for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tons .
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the price of sugar rose again around a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar@@ s between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os must remain per pound , according to the 2016 Report &quot; Agricultural Pro@@ spec@@ tors &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agriculture and Food Organization .
if current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar export would generate around 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will surely go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro in his speech on October 21 , 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the shut@@ down of a total of 98 sugar cane mills , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats most is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents were in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first jubil@@ ee , the first letters began to come .
these were official documents , which were distinguished only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date .
all of us were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve every withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was sum@@ mon@@ ed and the letters became more and more frequent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the abandoned factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he insur@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , awaits the retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory , during which he helped .
with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 years of work .
the best developed industrial area in Cuba and the most important work force producer was extingu@@ ished .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for the employment and services they generated in the communities in which they were located .
we will never know whether during the M@@ amm@@ ut speech of October 21 , 2002 , when he saw the then president in the eyes of the people present when he assured that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would go well .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane mills
since 2004 , sugar cane is only extracted high by grinding .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the folk community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to protest , they also stopped to asp@@ ire the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other establishments .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to search for other factories .
they became spare parts .
without a future perspective , many young people left the region at once .
a food factory was created in the area whose production is not even for the care of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests give the old soldier a pension of two thousand pes@@ o a month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a suppor@@ tive person , yet he does not forgive the lies they told him .
they have tor@@ mented him for ten years .
N@@ ene reti@@ res for 65 years , not because he lacks power , but because he is em@@ bit@@ tered .

the workshop ends with the fact that the young participants fa@@ th@@ om topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , conflict , love , acceptance &quot; or whatever comes into mind .
these questions are inspired by songs and videos in which the young people are the protagon@@ ists .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ k &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the tribal area of the Kit@@ w@@ cal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called Highway of T@@ ears , a street section in West@@ kan@@ ada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered .
the cases were mostly not solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motive of a video game to convey how important it is to preserve traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation .
many of the songs have appeared in indigenous languages , although the young@@ sters do not always know the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ net@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars hip @-@ hop group , who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dialect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an , the verse is available in tran@@ scription , as is a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to go on my days on earth
this is the day when you will take our cry
because we have lost our way in life as a youth
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
they can grow and move forward as well as our youth
so they can do what they intended for the Creator
in the comments section , the reader and advoc@@ ate of the Cre@@ e language will also contribute to Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au &apos;s contribution and add the verse in sy@@ ll@@ ables ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
in Japan plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plastic dishes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in the Netherlands &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) outside a typical restaurant in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in Japan you can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers , which is exactly on the menu , are displayed near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Plastic Models of the dishes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) of any food served in this restaurant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether to enter the restaurant or continue .
there is an entire industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are many small companies producing plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so ordinary that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend is turning them into show@@ y cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets today .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a number of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sales : new plastic bed decorated phone bands , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are a few sho@@ als fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo station .
the new boom in food production is becoming increasingly complex .
in this case an ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) turned into a mobile @-@ stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
we also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo railway station .
and here is an apple that holds your cell :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that &apos;s just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
some mobile phone stands and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case i@@ kur@@ a or Lach@@ s@@ rogen is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my cell phone with laugh@@ ing che@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form in order to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest mobile stand has the form of melting ice .
in addition , we also have rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands of dried salmon .
further qu@@ ir@@ ky plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # ...
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which de@@ votes itself to the supply of the restaurant industry . for example , with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the inter@@ ming@@ led and killed regularly only appear in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle brings with them .
reporting on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background .
the day after a violent incident no one looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind every body , behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never heal .
this is why the Mexican news portal Ani@@ mal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; dealing with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) , telling these victims a voice and telling stories about people who were involved in the battle between the law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els .
Ani@@ mal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co describes the project as follows :
organized crime makes us not only afraid of our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities need to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
a video titled &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how Fear Chang@@ ed Life &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
one main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches for hidden graves after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez , who in only one day lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ ests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like every Sunday , we are preparing ourselves again today for the task we have placed before and after tom@@ bs , according to the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15 , he should be back , but he never came back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I &apos;m alone with three children who need an apprenticeship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother who is here with me .
at the moment , it has no income .
you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but it does not pay them out , because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where shall we get those ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Ani@@ mal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the federal state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter in what form it appears :
I have been familiar with illness and sensation@@ alism for several years now .
I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the front pages with pictures , which can actually only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from files by specialists .
it brings me out of the compos@@ ure .
sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealer ) when he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they walk through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cul@@ ed those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ action of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by the fact that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so@@ aring up &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they try to convince that they will be spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies if they do not stir and remain silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the capital district : how a family was pl@@ under@@ ed with threats . &quot; this describes how armed criminals were black@@ ma@@ iled from their business month by month until they destroyed not only the business but also broke their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain never passes away , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we will only contact you if it is absolutely necessary .
the far@@ ther we are from each other , the better .
she concluded with the words :
we want others to be arrested , as one does not know when they will dec@@ eive or kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days whether weeping would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain .
journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega released the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a generation drawn by violence . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares for the child of a missing wife and a man murdered by organised crime ?
how is it possible to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , their parents care for them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he says he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , roast potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - speak@@ ably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was over two years earlier when he was just a few blocks from his home , seeing the bloody body of his father that had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the citizen &apos;s council for public security and government of the government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office counted 3@@ 103 kill@@ ings .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Ani@@ mal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data in 2015 . its aim is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug traffi@@ cking , which has tor@@ mented the country over the past four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this contribution and the pages to which it links , contain images on which violence is represented .
the Fak@@ e@@ check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the year after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first publication , it has been mis@@ guided to portra@@ y trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker crossed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ pping around and explo@@ ded , killing 230 people .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been neglected for years and devast@@ ated it . the streets of the region became dangerous paths filled with po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , the tank car fell victim to the victim .
official representatives described a fire@@ ball , which covered dozens of houses including a cinema close by , which was full of people who watched the FIFA World Cup .
houses burned and glued corp@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to the unknown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an image titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Das ist Nigeria &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; by Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ More photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies that are str@@ ung on the floor while people look at it .
but here history does not end .
over the years , the same photo has been edited several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms and fal@@ sely attributed to real trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , comb@@ at@@ ants of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
witnesses reported dr@@ astic atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one was left to count corp@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Human Rights Watch citizen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
the follow @-@ up time could only be shown graphi@@ cally on the basis of satellite images .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ resolved , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of the B@@ oko Har@@ am to gain land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the image from the Democratic Republic of Congo appeared again , when it was wrong@@ ly presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris .
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented assignments on Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the picture was presented as evidence for mass kill@@ ings .
even a step further , personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely relate the image of the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in order to deliver arguments .
the image from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash@@ back , published by the United Nations , those who escaped were able to escape pun@@ ches , rape and some dead , some through burning .
while others reported about the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts appeared like the following , who brought together these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news site fal@@ sely claimed that President Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ ein has said that monks and politicians have participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image of the Democratic Republic of Congo to portra@@ y this information .
the original contribution , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be viewed here .
other news organizations called AF@@ P as their source were also fal@@ sely attributed to Th@@ ein &apos;s statement , but they had not associated the image of the DR Congo .
the worldwide reach of false information
traces of these false links range back to 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse picture search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can exceed limits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures under 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said image of the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mas@@ on of private parties , social media platforms and common and national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed wrong reports , occasionally others have tried to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have del@@ im@@ ited examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use and linked them to the respective countries on the basis of which page they were published . thus , we want to show the range more clearly than by language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases have also been linked together ) several examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use may come from .
here are some cases that can now be detected completely ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fra@@ mes .
country examples of false coupl@@ ings of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers that are still available through the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ si@@ fications .
the grey countries are examples that , according to the metadata and information available through Tin@@ Eye , are likely to show counter@@ fei@@ ting examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image of the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread on the &quot; war of the Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

one side that caused rum@@ ors to be noticed was that the said photo Christian shows that Muslims were killed by Muslims .
Canada , 2015 .
in this article , a Que@@ bec City blo@@ gger not only names the false report , but also discusses the mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions about the intentions of the persons and the trage@@ dies involved in it ( in DR Congo and beyond ) .
Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ Ã¡n qu@@ em@@ ando a los cr@@ isti@@ anos &quot; ( In Nigeria , they burn the Christians ) .
in this article about explo@@ sions in North @-@ Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , the district is identified as the Christian part of the place .
La Rep@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica cited as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( although it is not known whether the original report has included the picture ) .
France , 2015 .
T@@ wit@@ ter@@ contributions after the massac@@ res of the B@@ oko Har@@ am , as this one , who used the image of the Democratic Republic of Congo to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam , &quot; have clearly not seen pages like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster who refu@@ te this .
Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster named the faulty use of the image since 2011 in connection with Nigeria , then promoted by a post of U.S. , anti @-@ Islamic comment@@ ator P@@ am@@ ela G@@ eller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Germany , 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; genocide against Muslims continues in Myanmar , Nobel Peace Prize lau@@ re@@ ate silent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this article draws attention to the continuing p@@ light of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims in Myanmar , but quotes the work of an article of the Indian Express with the image of the DR Congo ; the Indian Express article did not contain this picture at the time of publication of our article .

&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , there is a pillar of action : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , there is a pillar of action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ cking photo you &apos;ve ever seen ! ) .
this page used the picture as proof that Muslims killed Nig@@ eri@@ an Christians .
this asser@@ tion was re@@ fut@@ ed by a Greek Fak@@ e@@ check page 2013 and again in 2016 .
Iran , 2012 .
a Association of The@@ ology ( mul@@ lahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim via the N@@ asi@@ m news agency and used to illustrate the image of the DR Congo .
Italy , 2015 .
an inhabit@@ ant of the old town of P@@ ie@@ di@@ ca@@ stell@@ o of Tren@@ to posted this news on his side to express his solidarity with the massacre in Nigeria in 2015 .
Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo from the DR Congo was shared as evidence of the bom@@ b@@ ings of B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of an ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo , on the one hand a tweet , which expresses sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and , on the other hand , to timi@@ date the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya claims , since the photos were mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government published a judicial review of what it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliberately fin@@ alised news and photos that came to international media , international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings concerning Myanmar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this election , published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of rum@@ ors who operate H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and are used by extrem@@ ist groups to point out that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often spread by the Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defensive aspir@@ ation of a bu@@ limi@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political provo@@ cation ? ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this post , addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , makes it clear that the image of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims killing Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar has admitted in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the image is still contained in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this 2014 article about students who had been killed by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the news page An@@ Ã¡@@ lis@@ is Digital , released by B@@ oko Har@@ am , has explicitly stated that the image does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that there is a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture was later put into circulation in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 , the paper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ dun@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world sleeps ) .
the image of the DR Congo changed with this Twitter h@@ ash@@ tag and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the massac@@ res of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve a greater attention to these events taking place in the name of Islam .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was t@@ wit@@ ched as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ret@@ ali@@ ated ) , but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Vietnam@@ ese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was supposedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums such as this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it a false message .
the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dis@@ soci@@ ated from the embassy in which the image was included in DR Congo .
there are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye also points , but are no longer fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the craw@@ ler and occasionally have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may ultimately bear a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and Pictures
there are two major themes or frames that go through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the assass@@ ination of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued in comparison to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe in these images .
with social media , there are tens of people who un@@ intentionally share the water around a tragedy .
is this mood of false and false information suggest@@ ing that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and dimin@@ ish the real horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the distribution of forci@@ ble images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
one argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowled@@ ging the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images ensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and spectators and take the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( for example , this study , which investigated how violent media work to help others ) .
while there is some debate about violent portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , the fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
technologi@@ sts are experim@@ enting with algorithms in order to support the fight against fake news . they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which an image suggests something , which can actually be used detached from context or in a completely ab@@ u@@ sive way .
however , any investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons used in accordance with CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. irre@@ plac@@ eable ) endeav@@ ours to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not at all to translate .
there are such words in every language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well @-@ known today ( such as the famous Portuguese Sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish Sob@@ or@@ esa ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list .
most of these lists cover Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird chose to focus on small languages .
for example , in the blog you can find words from the V@@ ine @-@ cla@@ p language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - get your parents in recognition of what they have done for you in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words in the H@@ uns@@ ite language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - the comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after being war@@ med in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog about :
they def@@ use other cultures , expose other thoughts and awaken our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze and classi@@ fy the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page want to publish more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speakers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst floo@@ ding of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ ding and land@@ slide catastrophe in this decade .
initiated by the mon@@ soon , which usually starts at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have stepped across the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
following a response from the Sri Lanka cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ al centre of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundred people were missing because of the floods and slu@@ dges .
more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people have been transported to 304 safe locations .
rainf@@ all started on Saturday ( 27 May ) and the water levels in some areas slowly decreased .
health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the scale of disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods ag@@ grav@@ ate the Den@@ gu@@ e@@ fi@@ esta crisis , warns Save the Children after further ra@@ ins are already on its way .
this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus stood in the high water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ avi@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded due to the water level of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and further five are being completed to transport emergency supplies for residents included in their flooded villages .
various organizations and startups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and life @-@ nec@@ es@@ sities for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 today if you need help in this area .
the taxi call app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks worried people to share their location data with the app , so that the disaster centre is informed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flood control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button that allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . they were then sent free to the s@@ ri@@ l@@ lan@@ k@@ ische Rote Kreuz &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they also introduced a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button , which resulted in more than a thousand en@@ quiries and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people trapped by floods and land@@ slides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , in which several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring people in need into security and perform emergency measures .
this has prevented the loss of further human lives , while the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore normal@@ cy .

the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and a dear friend .
I confi@@ de in her my four year old daughter , she entru@@ sts me with her children ; she is my rock in the midst of the burning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the one minute we call even slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next , we chant rights for trans@@ gender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some keep the icon@@ ographic picture of a woman with a head@@ sc@@ arf high , bound from an American flag , other sc@@ are slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my friend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , right ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already run this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who know me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their imagination .
they have ma@@ stered me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves with being a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we all are put into the same Muslim drawer .
in our collective imagination , this drawer is so well constructed that as soon as Muslims like me do not fit into it , they must be exc@@ ised .
to be un@@ prin@@ ci@@ pled
I &apos;m not ste@@ aling it alone .
this even happened to the poet , whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images come to mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Quran and Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day he died .
but in the Western notion the religion of Rum@@ i was deleted as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a great part of the story of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims , which have been colon@@ izing western books for centuries .
this enti@@ cing image language is determined by the dark man who should be feared and the exotic woman that should be saved .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid sh@@ attered the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these images are prot@@ ru@@ ding even today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to keep them .
I worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen these powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous narr@@ atives dominate our news@@ feeds .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that has led nine Muslim women to their countries over the last three decades , while the United States could not even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this narrative fails to recognise that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body , both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it looks like the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who were hi@@ ber@@ n@@ ated with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer @-@ Muslims .
this narrative has so deep and fla@@ wed our collective imagination that often Si@@ kh men and children become the target of anti @-@ tim@@ us@@ phi@@ c attacks and har@@ ass@@ ings .
because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion belong
in the news industry we do more than just telling stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims , in the highest degree , constitute &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; various &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious groups in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one third of the entire Muslim population is African @-@ speaking Americans .
six of the ten American Muslims are among the first generation immigrants originating from 77 countries .

use approved .
four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in New York &apos;s sky@@ scra@@ pers ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time , when Khan had re@@ invented the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive Muslims and Americans .
but am I now a Muslim and American ?
sometimes , when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of bringing out my Muslim recipes or applying my handy hand@@ ker@@ chief , which all Muslims carry with them - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa@@ h W@@ utz . &quot;
I joke , we don &apos;t carry all T@@ ash@@ k@@ or@@ ane with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be almost always selected for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who try to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced on the ongoing tape of a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with len@@ ders , think tanks and experts for false information that has manipul@@ ated our already er@@ ron@@ eous image of what a Muslim is , or what Islam is .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is more than just a stranger who tears a woman &apos;s head .
or as the sc@@ ary map of attacks on mos@@ ques across the USA , see below .
screen@@ shot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ug@@ liest forms attacks our affili@@ ation .
it attacks our identity , which is so far @-@ reaching , so versatile and complex that it cannot fit into a drawer .

use approved .
I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but to be a Muslim was only born in my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they rever@@ t to the following terms : faith , behavior and belonging .
my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbour , my rock in the surf , would see that I am Muslims if they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air separating our houses .
she would see the ritual of every evening with my daughter when I held her in my arms and whis@@ pered the Arabic verses to protect the Quran and call it the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .
the author &apos;s grandmother , when she wins an Ik@@ eb@@ ana contest in Kar@@ achi , with her sisters sometime in the 1960s .
use approved .
belonging to me is the picture of my grandmother on the mother &apos;s side with her sisters ; how they gain a competition of the art of flower arran@@ ging in Kar@@ achi for decades .
it is the picture of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and incomplete paintings of painted Su@@ fi @-@ saints ; and a Qur &apos;@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with a hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be a Muslim means to speak the prayers that she had told me when I had a bad day .
to be a Muslim is how she taught me to relate to God : God Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a nation that - for centuries - has been col@@ oni@@ alized by an &quot; Empire &quot; which a company has established with the name of Hon@@ or British East ini@@ dies , it has a profound meaning to call God my only Lord .
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
belonging to belonging means to grow up and to hear that men do not cry but at the same time see that my immig@@ rant grandfather cries .
in between , while he writes books about modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an cried out for his family in the K@@ ash@@ mir , family , which he could not close in half a century into his arms .
belonging to it is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at the game risk .
to be a Muslim means to know that in the last two centuries , Europeans have &quot; colon@@ ised &quot; all to four Muslim countries .
it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of the story was cast over a Muslim country a century ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mir al tan of the British empire , was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dangerous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mos@@ que in England . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even before there were planes , he traveled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

belonging to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion is deeply rooted in our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops spread across every continent apart from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means to know that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is lie buried beneath the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim means to know that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means to know that when a tragedy over@@ looks the United States and the suspect carries a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means to know that fourteen hundred years ago the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slave named Bil@@ al .
it means to know that two hundred years ago , an African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this land .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the heat I feel when people over@@ came the airports to fight against the Muslim Brother .
it is the hope that I feel when we get up for our dreams and when we say black lives .
being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist , is the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple d@@ ashes , but failing to communicate them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of 1.7 billion bears more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reducing duality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people in this duality create structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in the Muslim registr@@ ars that began with President Bush and extended to President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists of the immigration officer , who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that closes its borders with people from just the countries that bom@@ bard them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ F@@ ly list &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which largely targets Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the wars that we are carrying and the bombs that we sub@@ due to Muslim countries .
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from the Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically sound image and asked them to evaluate groups on a scale ranging from 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations we Have To Lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep to de@@ file the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the er@@ ron@@ eous and dangerous im@@ prints that we perpet@@ u@@ ate in our news editorial offices .
at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims in the media industry trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the pod@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing by Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the pod@@ cast # Good@@ Muslim Muslim ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ el@@ o Square on Black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sch@@ ust@@ ers Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increase more Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope .

col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned about this difficult global time in which we are in .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet are now leading the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years earlier , they had not yet given them ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the story that I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but who made me an un@@ disputed Muslim today .
things I have left here like a bread cr@@ umb track in my speech .
things that may ar@@ ouse memories , for in all the inter@@ sections that make up our humanity , a story may l@@ ur@@ k where someone is made to another .
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , Con@@ vers@@ ations take place during the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred ac@@ adem@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not concepts we usually throw in our schools around us or read them in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why can I tell this here at TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are fought and how people were enth@@ r@@ alled by creating the &quot; other &quot; in public performance , four decades ago was scientist of Stan@@ ford .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of doing so deliberately and un@@ consciously , as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March because the occupation that we have a new future in which we have no president who bom@@ bed the chocolate cake as he has already broken countries and &quot; to other made &quot; people goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urban linguistic diversity
story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniele Rossi , using license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) initiative , telling stories in their original language is a possible response .
global Vo@@ ices recently reported on another initiative by Steven Bird , the uns@@ ur@@ passed blog .
here , however , T@@ LS focuses not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of languages in large cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has conducted events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
for the cre@@ ators of the project :
the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces in which inhabitants must not forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening often is linked to understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to appreciate , feel , connect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format stor@@ yt@@ ellers introduce their story in their own language and then translate or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not a professional story t@@ eller , their devotion and their depic@@ tion lead to the audience becoming aware of it .
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotions when language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso that is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us tells the tale of the rab@@ bit and the vian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; after explaining the meaning of his f@@ able , John Ny@@ am@@ us asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organisers hope to extend this . those who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ eller guided tours .
Puerto Rico calls for US re @-@ determination of sovereign debt
with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounts to 72 million US dollars , various religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 . the March started with the South African Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the Old City of San Ju@@ an .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ ter@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ ter@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ ter@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ ter@@ Ã­a . &quot;
the advoc@@ ates of re@@ building debts also filed a petition on the official home page of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos claim that politicians , bank@@ ers and government officials responsible for debts are responsible for their corruption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a Ste@@ ering Committee with no personal interest in public debts , with a fixed remuneration ensuring our working conditions , which acts in favor of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to reconci@@ le with sin@@ king retirement payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not the country &apos;s integrated national territory - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ri@@ cos requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; measures imposed from outside will run without the participation and conviction of the citizens , to be rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demonstration was named &quot; Night Vi@@ gil for Light and Truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network .
this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on digital culture , which is hosted in Berlin , dedicated itself to an event of the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign .
MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ na@@ y , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences based in France , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , managing director of Book S@@ prints , produced books completed within three to five days , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom ) .
the book published last year and is available here license @-@ free , contains a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it says :
this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built up and what are the real costs with which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense from our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ m , the beloved and acclaimed Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was painted from the directory of the A@@ dra jail in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about its current state or place of residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book entitled Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom immediately .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have let us begin to think about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we decide for ?
what have we given up in this process of temporarily extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in the custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown place from the A@@ dra jail , a non @-@ military institution .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police &quot; Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a command of the military tri@@ bunal from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by people on 12 November 2015 who presented himself as an insi@@ der of the Assad government and took note of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
his place of residence and state remain unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist , and currently the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ sels &apos;s cultural prototypes was more for@@ esi@@ ghted than the work he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ lizations and here Greek @-@ Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences .
Bass@@ el could not yet know that ten years after he began with this work , the IS would put everything in place to wipe out this architecture , which not only em@@ bodies the cultural heritage of Syria but the world .
this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent all my life dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was in jail .
I have learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other det@@ ain@@ ees how they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a trial which she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together on the book for one year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and translated it from Arabic into English .
the book is available roy@@ alty @-@ free .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It happens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens at each visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose my mind in the moment we embrace ourselves ,
that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards
I forget the prison &apos;s crow@@ ding
and I will enter into every detail of your voice and words
which I carry with my passion ,
when your eyes say good@@ bye
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to rec@@ la@@ im all the moments ,
and to cry and smile about your absence .
I persu@@ ade myself that I will return soon ...

Bas@@ tion &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
by 2016 , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in custody since 2011 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices @-@ Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we reiter@@ ate our call today in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambique : charges of corruption @-@ judged director after release on previous posts
Moz@@ ambique re@@ acted with anger to a corruption case in which a government member returned to work in the state apparatus after half of his prison sentence where corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , arrested in 2008 and sentenced in 2010 to 22 years in prison together with four other defend@@ ants due to disp@@ ers@@ al of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( about 800@@ ,000 Euro ) .
the money came from the public funds of Moz@@ ambique &apos;s airports , whose advice was Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was freed in 2016 due to good management and immediately called for his re @-@ adjustment to the company , which took place on 19 April .
in accordance with a statement issued by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which evaluated the motion , there would be no reason for Cam@@ ba@@ za to refer back to his old post , as the company did not carry out any disciplinary proceedings after his detention .
however , many inhabitants do not welcome the action well .
in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , abbrevi@@ ated C@@ IP ) condemned the company &apos;s decision to restore its director in an interview with Deutsche Welle :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we take to note is that the firm should also initiate a disciplinary action against the re@@ perc@@ ussions .
the company , however , was silent and did not cause appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the social media of Moz@@ ambique , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to prison and half of whom had eaten .
he could give paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent he has cons@@ ented to be integrated into the company which he helped to inflic@@ t damage .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence .
contradic@@ ting !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambi@@ an and student of political science in Brazil says , the director does not say anything about morality :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him I can &apos;t believe that someone was rewarded in such a way that the state already insul@@ ted the state so massi@@ vely .
Cam@@ ba@@ za does not want to return to the state and serve the state , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead he only served by the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as though it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself became tired of this man who was sum@@ mon@@ ed and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ us pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief is in prison :
eves belong to Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison , will not only be remembered as the first independent president for the Moz@@ ambique , but also as a sharp , single @-@ cut and - inci@@ dentally - proph@@ etic or@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of his most famous verbal representations was when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious man was able to sell also the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not like that . he changes tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious human being is also criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison ; he sat for 10 years and was free .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wrong@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spi@@ der b@@ ages . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known Social Network took their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as adj@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Burma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the past few years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may be associated with rac@@ ism today , but the word itself does not automatically trigger hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; many people have reported that even posts in which they have reviewed the use of the word have been cens@@ ored for their use .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basically different mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , it is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ king A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way to know if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a p@@ un .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sentence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ku la - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is of the opinion that it will reduce the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before removing all posts that are suspected of being rac@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook does not delete the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; manually . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you are writing on Facebook .
what should be done instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the adjacent words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( spac@@ ers ) .
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , receive a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to anyone spreading hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game , with the users of social networks simply starting to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored term to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is ban@@ ished from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new policy of Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was banned the li@@ king , posting and sharing of content for 24 hours because the post &quot; did not meet the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their views against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author wrote his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism are bad in the country .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believed that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , such as the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asking for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it seems as if they started this without local context or technical support and have banned words like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ as cur@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied posts .
if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a great deal of revenue , that would be great .
Chrom@@ ebooks &apos;s automatic cens@@ orship has caused a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le amongst users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech , to see if their posts are taken off the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of fac@@ ebook posts that didn &apos;t include hate speech but were still removed :
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kal@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , then heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists , who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence , have increased .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should additionally heat the violence in the Myanmar commun@@ es , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for its failure to control the hat@@ ching hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese sides .
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to examine and learn from them more in context than on code concentrating initiatives .
in Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago concludes with the nursery
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law bann@@ ing this practice so that the age of marriage is now 18 .
before this change of the marriage network , some members held Hin@@ du and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 there was a great public out@@ cry . at that time , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups in the country , said that the state should not interfere since age did not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner of the UN Convention on Children &apos;s Rights , the under@@ age is defined as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every man under the age of 18 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who had already been married to 15 in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the statistical central office of the country confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 young girls under 19 were married from 1997 to 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements intended to abol@@ ish laws for children &apos;s marriage followed at the bottom and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this result .
nevertheless , everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition provided for tensions in this actually un@@ complicated case , and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the draft law in general .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the draft law against the children &apos;s marriage was decided - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who ab@@ stained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him the law .
now only the president of the country must agree and let the law be announced .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators posted a status update on Facebook , which once again posted Les@@ lie @-@ An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one against it .
having previously decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of the social media users were thrilled , because the laws of child@@ birth had finally been changed .
Lov@@ ell Francis , a member of the ministry of ministry in the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk that disgu@@ ised the core of the matter , but you know what ? the children &apos;s marriage in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are now illegal , and that is worth almost any price .
while Abel Jackson thought it took long enough to complete the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was happy that the day had finally come :
public status update on Facebook from L@@ ara qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , Excel @-@ related news !
the law of marriage has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for this - 0 against it ! ! ! &quot;
the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group who was quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted :
the age of marriage in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now amounts to 18 years , regardless of their religious affili@@ ation .
the design for the change of the marriage network was decided today , on June 9 , 2017 .
in the House of Represent@@ atives there are 41 dep@@ u@@ ties and 35 were present at the vote .
all the dep@@ u@@ ties who were opposed have voted in favour of the law .
the children &apos;s marriage is legally no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... )
many thanks to all the activists who have challenged him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our dep@@ u@@ ties .
however , a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organization of the country .
months ago , Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take judicial steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems to be able to fulfill his promise .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most social media users wished that the debate on the subject would be different .
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
dear Sat , if we , instead of talking about it in general , in a way that can only evo@@ ke panic and disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure , instead of talking about the problem that the state , our daughters in front of it , are being ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are opposed to them , &quot; would you be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to legal action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where child marriage is legal or still the norm , even though there are laws that prohi@@ bit it .

by mirr@@ oring web pages , Turkish users can view Wikipedia contents
the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A Copyright law in the United States , internationally obsc@@ ured .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for more than a month Turkey has now closed the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
day after day , it becomes clear how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series defend themselves against blocking .
although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to using b@@ yp@@ assing tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the world &apos;s third @-@ largest VPN presence ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking Article from Wikipedia since 2008 , as described recently in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act ( 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
in China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , there are now several mirrors ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and are frequently updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform cleared all the Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentr@@ alized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( so calcul@@ ator computer connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
however , the content is accessible despite legal prohibition .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after listening to the news ( via Wikipedia ) , we all started to take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . so there is the possibility to read the contents in a decentr@@ alized and distributed way .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia contents even if they cannot reach www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org .
IP@@ FS also indicated that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cr@@ isti@@ an Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ z@@ pedi@@ .org , an irr@@ or@@ page of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar error messages when in the respective country Wikipedia is blocked .

it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a mirror .
you can access another URL that is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server re@@ direc@@ ts the request to the correct Wikipedia page so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia himself if they are locked in Turkey .
for this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .

and his hom@@ etown , next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ rate situation helps in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ re ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida &apos;s lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that a le@@ op@@ ard would be on the bank of the Rap@@ ti River .
the river Kur@@ fÃ¼r@@ sten@@ damm is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the le@@ op@@ ard was and I immediately started to kin@@ dle pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition of N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and wants to deep@@ en understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he should know it , for he was standing face to face with tig@@ ers :
a tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep in sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
bed@@ time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness when suddenly the king of the book appeared . he sat down immediately , we see us and he star@@ es at me through the sc@@ arf @-@ trees ! !
&quot; &quot; &quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I click for conservation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his passion for fo@@ stering N@@ ept@@ une nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and usually lived in a tent to make recordings of Ot@@ ters at Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation .
please take a look at some of these photos below .

this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version was once again published as part of a content @-@ sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women avoid speaking with the greatest care , the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead they use a pron@@ ou@@ n or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that due to social pressure they should respect the husband , as well as the fear of the consequences they should desp@@ ise the norm , keep this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted by a false judgment from the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a and expelled from her family and the village community after she had addressed a married couple with names .
the tradition of having their wives also not on the name is also common among men . however , they have far fewer re@@ mitt@@ ances to be feared if at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel as well as house@@ wives , joined a unique club and became the main theme of the city quickly .
it is a place only for them alone , where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , it is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign run by the Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers community and is committed to the exploitation of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to detect practices such as children &apos;s marriage and exile from HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS infected persons , and direc@@ ts those clubs .
it reports how these clubs create a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them amb@@ ass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion was about women who do not call their hus@@ bands by their name .
she chose this topic because she wanted to open up the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem that women can easily identify with .
not to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands , is a custom that they have all been du@@ ti@@ fully maintained and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is considered as a dec@@ eit@@ ful woman , as a woman without morality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about it until this discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try out at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said that I should call him by his name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini started their first discussion lu@@ b with this self @-@ confidence in their luggage .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
then they all said , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can name us as they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they told their hus@@ bands &quot; names , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women could never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
a woman was so shy that she only hid in front of herself during the whole exercise ; another decided to leave all the touched fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in adren@@ aline rush about having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands by their name .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member chose to do it during dinner in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law soli@@ di@@ fied her , she got sc@@ ared and said it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rou@@ gh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation art@@ ete in force .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ ced red dot on the forehead that indicates the sp@@ ouses :
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would wear the zin@@ ced red dot , if he did it too .
he laugh@@ ed only and I stopped wearing it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the other women have not stopped completely , but think that they are now in a better position to choose for themselves , not to wear it on some days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and objectives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make an excursion at every disc@@ us club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their birth@@ days with cake for the first time in their life ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so hon@@ estly about some things , such as our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say certain things loud , no matter how small they are .
in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected with the clothes .
some women in the group have only wore sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most , that &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ es@@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a trousers ; they didn &apos;t dare .
after much dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code , the moral associated with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled their own pair of tas ( upper shirts ) into a discussion panel so that the women could wear them .
next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will manage it .
on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since their first discussion lu@@ b , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things start rolling slowly :
so far , we have only done small steps .
some women tried it a few times , but then again stopped telling the name of their husband .
some , including me , still do it , but only when they are alone and no other family members are there .
only one or two women continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now carry Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini declares :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am it too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commemor@@ ative day
the Beat@@ les during their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
on June 29th of this year , the H@@ ash@@ tag ( The Beat@@ les Memorial Day ) was on display in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans shared memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit to the Beat@@ les in Japan in 1966 is regarded as a turning point in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who exclusively inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 , noticed in 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just barely five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese spin through .
it became clear to the people here that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; told Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
good morning ! today is the Beat@@ les memorial day in Japan .
also today songs are sung by the Beat@@ les in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English lessons at Japanese middle schools .
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll supposedly represents John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
and as it is for fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the well @-@ known places connected with the band .
if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places you absolutely need to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Matthew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( New York Memorial )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( From the link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be qu@@ ir@@ ky enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
exactly today in 1966 the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the film K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
we did the same last year .
and of course some companies also use the fan community from the market , such as this R@@ amen Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen !
and what could this be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how the day will run today .

bald @-@ headed men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Moz@@ ambique
the police of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia warned the people that bald men could be target of attacks in Moz@@ ambique .

a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald people for organ@@ ics , presumably for dis@@ believing purposes , troubles the police of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambique . the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was found be@@ headed and part of the organs were removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used .
there are local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a bald man could bring gold or bring wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia of the BBC declared .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Moz@@ ambique .
another group , the goal of exec@@ utions for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the UN 2016 to carry out a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
attention to bald men who travel to Moz@@ ambique with bald men in Moz@@ ambique are the target of ritual attacks , warned the Muslim police after the latest assass@@ ination of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Moz@@ ambique , said that the local police already follows the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ Ä@@ bal@@ a , province of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia , for presumably super@@ sti@@ tious rituals , has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , this draw the police of the Republic of Moz@@ ambique in consideration ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a belief existed , according to which the victims in the head might have power generating the riches .
in recent days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country .
Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the Chron@@ icle of the poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa on Facebook , indicating that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty facing Moz@@ ambique :
I M@@ Ã@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ MAN WIT@@ HO@@ UT A country in which people would have shame to go on the street , attracted them from the shots of a portrait shooting in which the teachers would be ashamed to pursue sex against good notes and others would not hurt or even take their lives to earn their bread , a land in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald @-@ headed for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes or &quot; black magic . &quot;
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some missed the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humor .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambique and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the head of the district of Mor@@ Ä@@ bal@@ a , Pedro S@@ ange , and the police spokes@@ man Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald @-@ headed :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moz@@ ambi@@ can authorities are very worried about the assass@@ ination of bald people . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in November 2015 , Ms N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i told Ms N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i that she had been contacted by people who out@@ lived themselves as an insi@@ der of the Assad government .
they reported that their husband had been sentenced to death , but gave no further information .

free Bass@@ el : citizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized due to liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion , &quot; having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o demanding democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ us as &quot; an internal affair , &quot; and a spokes@@ man tells that he considers it &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
however , China still continues to appeal to the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to permit him treatment abroad .
while some countries have critici@@ zed the harsh treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the issue .
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
united nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure in order to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad .
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about the release of Li@@ us .
the relationship between China and Norway came to a stand@@ still after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon exports to China since exports were largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his award in Oslo .
because of his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately release Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us , as she announced in a statement on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family members .
they should meet and receive all the visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told him that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; want him to have the possibility of treatment abroad in so far as it can help him in his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced on 27 June that the news agency asks the Chinese authorities to release not only Li@@ u but also to liber@@ ate his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US embassy called for an angry response from China , with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared that China should offer the couple the following :
protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice , based on the Chinese Constitution and the legal system as well as international obligations .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also introduced a resolution in Congress to press the Chinese government on imposing Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I urge China to un@@ condition@@ ally release Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o so that he can embar@@ k on proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany and Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hopes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets all the medical support he needs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on July 7 and 8 at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing of the Reu@@ ters news agency that China had great concerns whether the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada in the United Kingdom
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um urged China to provide Li@@ u with appropriate medical care and to give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u &apos;s lawyer told AF@@ P earlier that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always watched the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , and contact him .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells us :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to release advoc@@ ates for the exercise of these rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
France in France
France &apos;s foreign ministry in a statement on 29 June urged China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there will be no further information whether France will eventually accept it .
Taiwan , Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of land@@ lords in Taiwan called on China on 27 June to release Li@@ u and show a greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectu@@ ally Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very worried about Li@@ u in a statement on June 28 and admitted that many asked him to pray for the well being of Li@@ u .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Doma@@ ine Public
is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised as an independent state on an international level .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city .
this remark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association , the Minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party because they compared Singapore with other countries .
he supported that Singapore should be considered a city .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people commit a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turn logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to defend the existing author@@ itarian practice of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices , to create this precious land , one hears that we are ultimately no country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar that it had the impression of fle@@ eing from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which the political system of Singapore could not compete with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of that , it inevitably appeared un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are run permanently by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once one reaches the core of the subject , the good old ly@@ re emerges from author@@ itarian rulers , preten@@ ding to be democr@@ ats , abandon the twisted logic , as it fits better to their power .
in the end , the answers given in the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam have been given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judicial system , and our political system .
he posed appropriate questions with non @-@ responses of a rational manner .
Rachel Z@@ eng requests Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to elu@@ ci@@ date his opinion , as she did not understand this conclusion .
personally I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the effort to clarify this point , provided that he was paid high enough to be part of the government of Singapore .
by announ@@ cing his comments on the blog , he pointed out the critics that one should start reading the entire address of the conference so that one could better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections were so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not a country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who , as the leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard what awaits me - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes it is properly associated and aware of what he def@@ ends .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K review destro@@ ys the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; believe a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian advoc@@ ate ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , on which country are the sovereign rights of the city Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
since he plays an important role within the cabinet , statements made by Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapore do their military service , do they only defend their city but not their country ?
who does our prime minister have to pay back ?
what is the value of our rosa badge ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; Journey of a Dec@@ ade &quot; adds to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore , and has always been a city :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not said what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence appears to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
no one ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country , above all &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should speak more about the defence of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
their answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series , with rum@@ ors exposed over certain parts of the world and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series is from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question I asked most in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been living in Japan since 1994 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions .
my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice Ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans perhaps cook in anger when they are held for Americans , but it doesn &apos;t bo@@ ther me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that Canadi@@ ans distinguish us from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans attach a Canadian flag to their back@@ pack when they travel .
all dear Canadi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand , ... .
so it was already when I started travelling through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we clearly say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excuse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if you were confused with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
first of all : being a &quot; nice &quot; means basically to be sp@@ ying - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle yet tra@@ gically incomplete figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤n@@ ger ) .
if Canada really is a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing that you can encounter .
being harmless means to be un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and not to earn any attention .
this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from the things that are happening around you .
I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of the Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of only our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t talk often about the fence with the neighbours .
we lack the warm , open friendliness , which I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau then entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot;
music video of a pop band par@@ odi@@ zing Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
a pop band , famous in Thailand , has published a music video that par@@ odi@@ aks the jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 and , despite its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new song &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ el Girl ) of the band Tattoo Ink describes a young man who tells the rules his girlfriend does . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although not specifically political , the music video is indirectly related to the ongoing military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video for the song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the video uploaded to Facebook was 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and got 8,@@ 800 likes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it relates to the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these videos of the videos that relate to some of the political topics that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; possibly refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army an absolute decision @-@ making power over important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious programme of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change of settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people considered by the Jun@@ ta as a critic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was also established in the army that over@@ sees online content and prosec@@ uted individuals who have been accused of le@@ ver@@ aging the monarchy .
Thailand deplo@@ ys a strict protection against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ esty &quot; ( Maj@@ esty &apos;s insul@@ t ) .
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later , there was a coup of the army .
one of the problems the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that buying is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van , before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists sit in jail because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy .
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the song showed members of the band that im@@ itated the &quot; Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by Put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life continues in the ruins of the gh@@ ost cities in Eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war society only re@@ covers very slowly in East @-@ West @-@ Asia , above all in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has now passed over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ an war officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still highly visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the coal basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Eur@@ asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together on Soviet sites in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , most of the Russians and rab@@ bits live in the area .
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
during the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district has been 16@@ ,000 people after it has barely risen over a decade .
in 1989 , about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey buildings of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ ch@@ uk@@ ow@@ kas , symboli@@ ze the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings have fallen into decay and are rarely inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elderly man .
he starts talking and it is difficult for him to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still un@@ ambig@@ uous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens that all served the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded magni@@ fic@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have since left the district .
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha about fifty inhabitants live .
approximately 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas , which still host one or two families , can be seen on the balconies , where the washing is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden us to photograph us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultiv@@ ating agricultural products for home use ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable farming .
it &apos;s difficult to get over the rounds .
the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages during the winter .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we &apos;ll build zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about ten years ago an elderly woman called Gal@@ ina ( or A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite her el@@ dest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left before Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will stay forever in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ ina &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells us that she and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are , we visit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we can &apos;t do it all the time - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ asha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the floor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we &apos;ll build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five children in her house for a while .
Nat@@ asha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she remembered the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia simply broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ k@@ hum@@ i ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take a while , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha holds about $ 9 child money for each child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house , where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chi@@ ckens .
she says that at first it was a very sc@@ ary situation when many people left the village after the war .
but in the course of time it lost its anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no fear of the dark street or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , however , it has rather to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right for them .
I remember every day how the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our conversation is drawing to an end , a little boy passes over to us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
as they run , some of them throw stones on the ruined buildings .
these ruins are a part of their childhood , which ensure un@@ obj@@ ectivity in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it differently .

&quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hosts migrants on their long journey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez deri@@ ves a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and is published here with friendly permission .
on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city centre .
it is run by a 5@@ 9@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a cor@@ als @-@ pink bridal frame and gold @-@ colored ear @-@ rings in ted@@ dy bear form .
it is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2.@@ 50 dollars per night , guests can sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants arrive here .
sometimes , Mr@@ s Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez says , people come in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they start crying : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on cardboard boxes .
she does not want to refuse anybody .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , she bu@@ ys them drugs that they can &apos;t pay , she mass@@ aging them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived a short time ago .
I asked him if m@@ um Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mr@@ s Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a mou@@ sta@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it fits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , hoping to get to Boston where she will find her husband and the three children .
they have lived in Brazil , but for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States , it is normal to make a first stop in South America and then move north@@ wards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he says that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans are often travelling together and that Afri@@ cans speak already on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mr@@ s Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et had previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker at the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy got weaker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest of Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr@@ s Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells that her guests often send her text messages when they have gone to greet them or to tell her about the course of her trip .
she explains that her Christian faith is the pro@@ pul@@ sion of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to make chicken like Ghana .
wife Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city , a blind alley leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family incorporated immigrants in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on ceilings on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela declares that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing .
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people can help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his workplace .
the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula arrive from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©@@ n@@ dez tells me that he has fled from people in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to black@@ mail money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for accommodation and an unknown , a single educ@@ ator , offered him a roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next step is to take .
back in the house of Mama Africa is everything again full of guests .
in the ais@@ les travellers should quietly consult their phones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , most of them from Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away .
she looks like a proud grand@@ ma in her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair @-@ fle@@ cks she has made a female , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly , while she pre@@ aches her to me .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
a check point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang by Twitter users .
residents of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their phones .
on 10 July , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a phone alert in which it instruc@@ ts the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preventing access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but k@@ Ã²@@ n@@ ans the authorities could use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture as they , shortly after they had installed the app , exchanged news with a private We@@ Chat group .
the police reported that the app would identify and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , ebooks and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network .
this min@@ ors app is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person .
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while reporting on digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focuses on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the East and South , reality is very often dark for those who live in remote , displaced ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , authorities often arrange extreme en@@ grav@@ ings and surveillance measures , as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs .
Twitter @-@ based media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; ( &quot; Made in Germany &quot; ) , the cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where police officers in@@ discrimin@@ ately checked the inhabitants whether they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile alert required people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected in a check@@ point with a device without this software , they may be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced the people to use devices intended for older people .
this is a form of imprisonment by the rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images from mainland China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Image from mainland China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description which highlights the fact that the software can record the password request of a Windows operating system and thus gain unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computer and cell phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a response to the instructions of the city party council to minimize dis@@ semination of illegal content .
all government departments , authorities and affiliated organisations , including universities and research institutes , are obliged to follow the instructions of cy@@ ber security office when they operate their computers and communication devices .
a current Freedom House report , a US @-@ American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , the authorities issued a prescription for all residents and entrepreneurs to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; at local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist &quot; videos . however , this action viol@@ ates Ur@@ um@@ qui &apos;s personality rights and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible off@@ ences , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cries after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane portra@@ ys his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and realize that you are all alone in a place where anything important has van@@ ished .
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recognis@@ able from within as well as from the outside .
one who gives all honor to their name .
one that has broken down into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
but when reality takes you back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama , the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cries after death .
all doubts dis@@ integrate into smoke and you become aware of your existence , even when the earth moves on the axis of the Un@@ holy . it becomes clear to you that you are trapped between the walls of your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone .
they arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the Chief of the Security Service put it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he demonstrated his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest such as we@@ eds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ la@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the neighbor@@ hoods were cov@@ eted , but not my own .
for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time even if I didn &apos;t put any high demands on a city that has been plug@@ ged into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things had a little cal@@ med down after the power supply stopped in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence , shou@@ ting several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ la@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice disgu@@ sted with silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , real friends joined me ; we al@@ lied to a magnificent picture that filled my expectation fully and completely .
at such a moment , you become aware that you liber@@ ate the spirit from the lamp , but it simply does not interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the Military Security House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ amed it all the way to the Security Service office .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an was there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to talk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear how you scre@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ la@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are only brave enough to sh@@ out when we are not close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes were on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really dare to look in my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was my fol@@ ly , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my cause when I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement and his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the same with his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed proposition is up to this day in my nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture that I had been exposed for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I went through the yard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
then back through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I remember all the details before I enter the room .
otherwise they have allocated a larger cell to me this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share it with only one other prisoner , and I can sit immediately without waiting for their permission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I had to go back to an established method of communication : beating the fist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell @-@ mate was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ s@@ th@@ Ã¤@@ ft@@ ling &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation , he finally answered me .
apparently , none of the surrounding cells was a respected middle @-@ aged man , similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness , no prominent features can be seen on me , and there are no doctors here ; we are all numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all answers deny its existence .
maybe he was moved to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would leave him if I remain .
li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive away all these crow@@ s that are lab@@ elled at the fruits in my head &apos;s garden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance I still hear her scre@@ aming &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ la@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cries , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the color of destruction , until I saw the yellow light that showed us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; all@@ usion to the 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be inter@@ rog@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to protect the state security from us and prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ itors and terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tical dialect - so they played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mail and revealed the close view of their world view .
this is not a house that is not a country ; it is a curse which they call co@@ existence to turn the criminal of their clan into a hero .
I enter the inter@@ rog@@ ation room and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man , at least he seems to me like that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he cat@@ ches a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that der@@ ail him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than join this Ta@@ ge@@ di@@ ver and protest on demonstrations that will eventually come to an end anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it , not to answer .
I can &apos;t really say exactly when insul@@ ts and hits after a friendly conversation have become an ordinary means of communication .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
any voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , even though I had not done anything to deserve this punishment .
of punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; confession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the clo@@ ths .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices in your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him , and you can &apos;t hold back your cries .
my scre@@ ams didn &apos;t bo@@ ther him yet , which is why they exchanged the pipe with a cable .
at my first arrest , I wondered if the investig@@ ator had worked as a garbage collector in the past , or whether it belonged to the standard equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to present us the great invention of a giant cable from their point of view .
within a single hour three of them altern@@ ated while I was still in the row .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling and didn &apos;t find any pleasure in doing so , which is why he was next to an electrically loaded rod .
electricity f@@ lowed through my entire body , enough to supply my entire quarter .
my half naked body lying on the floor was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours , he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours passed , which happened to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhau@@ sting youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father must be fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and go , you will be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they always released me .
where do they go ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time indoors ; sometimes he s@@ lows down to his canvas , sometimes to his computer , and also to his couch .
but what you can rely is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives in the top floor of his family house , which had been owned by them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s family to flee their village in Palestine , where they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ es ( about : farmers ) .
for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist , facing the conservative majority and questioning their well @-@ established views on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ es@@ eed .
with his music , which often deals with themes such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown Am@@ man relevance , but also in cities ranging from Damascus to Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his thinking , and he can sympath@@ ize with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not openly admit it , he has a special tendency towards American foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his sympathy for those who are trying to survive in war zones has anything to do with his identity as the &quot; Palestinian refuge of the second generation &quot; - even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while in water he poured out Nes@@ cafÃ© in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; at this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a sen@@ sing hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam .
in principle , the mu@@ gs speak lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the wa@@ vy of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose first line of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when looking at the neighboring countries .
from this it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan drinking water - in order not to land in jail .
recently , the Ministry of the Interior , Jordan , cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic campaign front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contradic@@ ts the country &apos;s cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concert announcement .
the dep@@ u@@ ties and former press spokesperson for the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ eb@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert had just been cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer .
many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is a dangerous activ@@ ism which poses the proven legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; who continue to choose &quot; advoc@@ ating intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement should probably not be simply shallow rhet@@ oric , but in fact reflect a more and more clearly cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b returned to traditional gender norms by shaping his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently tra@@ m@@ pled woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those whom they should trust .
over the past few years , the number of &apos; Ehren@@ mor@@ de &apos; has been accepted in Jordan - the un@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of people of honour reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have been victims of murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way .
according to a 1954 anti @-@ crime law , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; be kept in prison for an in@@ definite period of time , &quot; and for their release , many years of bureaucratic expenditure as well as the guarantee on the part of the family is necessary for the wife to do nothing .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from issues that have long been regarded as t@@ abo@@ o in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was told politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b attacks the question of Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Lav@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song one verse repe@@ ats quite often :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which , in his words , &quot; that can get what you want &quot; - whether it is faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bians and that comments on gender equality have been cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program , Ro@@ ya , to later note that his comments were torn out of context , distorted and cens@@ ored in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but only a processed version was stre@@ amed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is openly campaig@@ ning for the Arabic LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als does not correspond to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who is still remembered today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ what , who was to work later on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can &apos;t Jord@@ ani@@ ans do that ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian news service held several former members of the government and members of the educational association , argu@@ ing that they had critic@@ ised social media comments on the problems linked to the corruption that was rooted in the country .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs believes that only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has now denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that &apos;s how it looks H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , deliber@@ ate and inner changes . it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
ultimately , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experiencing it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness by means of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and cra@@ d@@ led demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least , he hopes this .
until it is done , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue ra@@ pping and consequently also resist@@ ing .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
these large , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories about the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
it is assumed that it is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival which is usually also celebrated in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us in August . another theory states that the ban@@ quets , drums and dancing originated over more than a thousand years and come from a period when armies of the west of Japan were mar@@ ching in the northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the em@@ iss@@ ary , to the knees .
we are at Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to snap a few great seats , so we have a great view .
one can hardly imagine how big these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital city , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo , organised a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo for a long time : two fixed cars are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ ras@@ festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend its summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Sommer@@ festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ uch@@ a@@ festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high carriage was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange weapons against scissors and raz@@ ors

outside appearance and body care were seldom so important as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth out of crimin@@ ality and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the bar@@ ber .
El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to Lima &apos;s historic center - a region with a very high crime rate , where street consuming and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are com@@ mon@@ place .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend to copy the appearance and thus also the fallen hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) has led more and more normal citizens to go into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these costly hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; competition &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
experts compete against each other in order to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as you can see in the following video ( other videos on current cont@@ ests are on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive training in the hair art instead of bad advice that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only professional school in the community and the district , which we are very proud of , because we have built up this educational community out of love for the children .
Colombia : love letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters

&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Love messages to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
isn &apos;t it much more important to accommodate people who feel alien@@ ated , affection ?
this is precisely what the young Colom@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ ra@@ ga donated by the Foundation Bo@@ got@@ a and Cr@@ isti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la RÃ©@@ li@@ aciÃ³n ( letters to reconci@@ le ) , encouraging young people to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
recently , their country was the setting for a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part . after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government signed a peace treaty with the F@@ ARC guer@@ ri@@ lla movement ( German : revolutionary forces of Colombia ) , which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the signing of the peace treaty was deemed to be so significant that the Colom@@ bian President JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services .
before the Colom@@ bians , however , there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , who had lived in illegal camps for many years , were exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carried arms round the clock , must now re @-@ integrate into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , which had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now resume their ranks and support them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians would join together and help in the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ ll@@ ers to welcome them back in society .
the goal of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter - to be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters of reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an had the opportunity to speak shortly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
he explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more necessary .
he planned to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent response .
this is how the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former F@@ ARC fighters who now have their place in society and build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
so far more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ .
&apos;@@ i never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were delivered to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on March 19 .
a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the City Council of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bo@@ got@@ a travelled to the camp to transfer the letters personally .
the F@@ ARC &apos;s members acted as they did before in order to receive their leaders &quot; orders .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it is unbelievable how many different feelings can be tra@@ vers@@ ed in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; told the political student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ ll@@ ers live ) I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I reply to a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never in my life someone wrote something so beautiful , that &apos;s why I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ gged him completely and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was tired of the war , tired of being the faithful companion of this fighter for all the years , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never expected anything else from life than war . joining the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside that wa@@ its for us with open arms .
until now I have learned how to deal with weapons .
but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices , new voices
to the start , students and some of the F@@ ARC leaders gathered for a discussion .
the students were all grown up as pre @-@ war and the F@@ ARC was already in secret .
therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , its ideals , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the State affects the entire Colum@@ bian people . now that we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can help shape society more just in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a goal of this magnitude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
to hear these people who had never heard of hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I often saw as monsters and even hate people with beautiful feelings turned around by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives is hur@@ ting me .
but it comforts me that all people - even those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the Colom@@ bians were told that peace would reign after dis@@ armament .
but this is not the case .
as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people ready to resort to arms , to stand up and protest for their rights . and that is completely justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC are now putting on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - regardless of race , religion or ideology they belong - to raise themselves above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and sacrifice , as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

this is followed by the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ jam and whose first publication was published on the OC Media website .
homosexu@@ als and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers , including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with horror , activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that hangs on the LG@@ BT@@ Q community , like a women &apos;s sword , has not only come about overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has taken over the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published that deal with the deportation , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities arrested by suspi@@ cious qu@@ eer men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ former , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
since her childhood she felt she was actually a woman .
when she grew up she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had learned of the gender balance of their country@@ woman , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
from fear of her life , she eventually moved to the United States .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told someone needed my help .
it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can remove that shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents made the round through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on October 10 , 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was about to bring out a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a man &apos;s voice saying : &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I hurt nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you still honor the family , you sc@@ and@@ y ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and finally woke up in the hospital .
apparently some women had seen everything and began to scre@@ am .
the man had fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung .
OC Media : in which cases were you placed - in which of the men or that of women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out of date , there is my male name on it , but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
for this I am very grateful to him .
when I read his name for the first time in his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him for dealing with me respect@@ fully .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I received threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they asked me to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that it was all a lie .
they put absurd demands : some told me that I had to prove it by walking up without through the streets ; others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I had not changed my gender that everything was mere talk , and Phot@@ os@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people once said my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has humili@@ ated not only your family , but the whole republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother got too much and she put a rope around his neck .
fortunately , the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later a car with dark window pan@@ es and a number plate with a 95 on it stood under the window .
after it happened for the third time , I realized that there was something rotten .
my human rights activ@@ ist friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help I left the country , but then something unbelievable happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before I left Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought it without registering , without identification , without all .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage .
arrived and checked in at the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother at W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you wouldn &apos;t believe you &apos;re in security just because you left the country ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
our people already know which hotel you are in . they even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
but we don &apos;t talk about the sex equ@@ ation , that &apos;s a t@@ abo@@ o topic .
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish , I can &apos;t overcome this mental barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera I really bo@@ ther to look at the person they remember from their past - that is , my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have remained dor@@ man@@ t ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for this I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to someone who was in ar@@ gun for one and a half months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that during Ram@@ adan no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not shut out a new wave .
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
that is what I mean , they probably charge the relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end require a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced by blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are the gay men still locked in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine tells me that there are not so many .
if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives in order to face Ca@@ y@@ row &apos;s court .
as far as I know , they are held there so that they can be presented later as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but pur@@ pos@@ efully sub@@ merged in order to radi@@ cal@@ ise themselves .
OC Media : is it just a guess , or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he says that many people in this prison have disappeared after their beard grew .
there has been nothing new from them ever since .
they just took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , that person was himself when these people were taken with them .
up to now , however , they have not been presented as ban@@ dits , there have been no reports about this until now . but we suspect that such actions are possible .
why else would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and ab@@ duc@@ tions of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a bo@@ b .
I think that before 2003 I was already known throughout Gros@@ ny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 when sh@@ aria was applied , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally intended to introduce us to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately threw us back to the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had d@@ yed lashes , wore jeans and short sleeves .
the Ministry of Security of Sh@@ aria has never even har@@ med me a hair .
in front of the Russian theater in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me hit me .
it was a small place where several banks were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we were never offen@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t worry about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is often said to children when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten .
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long before Kad@@ y@@ rov stepped on the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began speaking on television about morality .
he did not talk about us per se , but primarily on women &apos;s behavior .
nevertheless , one could feel how people began to change in the city .
those who had laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before looked at you with suspicion .
during the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the republic steadily deterior@@ ating .
OC Media : what activity do you follow now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
I am currently responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a sort of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ et@@ re@@ eds , gather@@ ings , I accompanied them to the hospital and help them to get food cards .
I don &apos;t pay any cent for this .
I discovered these people myself when I lost refuge .
I am a Muslim and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear Hid@@ al@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
so nature is , it has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ echn@@ ya , who want to prophes@@ y to you with foam in front of the mouth that there are no wa@@ ils with them .
the Da@@ gest@@ ans have what the cab@@ ard@@ ins have , the Russians also have what ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live with men .
know , many think of transition to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different kinds of feeling to be precise , different attitudes of life .
for me , it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry that I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not so sad at all - I just know that I &apos;m myself now .
local groups warn of an increase of suicide in the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ ra@@ z community in Iran
the Ah@@ ra@@ z region is suffering from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last few months there has been a sharp rise in suicide .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ ra@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 pushed the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ ci@@ zi community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ ra@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had lit himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the inc@@ iner@@ ation was so strong that the doctors could do nothing .
he died shortly afterwards .
it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ ra@@ zi Centre for Human Rights told me that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have started .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers , who were hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families due to the persecution of the Iranian government and to pursue a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ v@@ ts@@ i family living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to make a living .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy assumed power and in 1925 did great efforts to termin@@ ate ethnic autonomy across Iran .
in the Ah@@ ra@@ z region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable crops for Iranian agriculture .
despite these precious resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population receives little of this wealth .
it is often a victim of untreated illnesses , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime has systematically refused the Ah@@ ra@@ zi Arabs to work systematically in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government also built a variety of dam@@ s , which diver@@ ge water from the Arab areas into the Persian areas , where the provinces Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie .
these dam@@ s have only managed to ag@@ grav@@ ate the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm @-@ industry .
the rate of unemployment among the Arab a@@ haw@@ k adolescents increased to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director for co@@ operatives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job , completed primary school , completed a secondary school 55 % and completed 45 % of a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ hi@@ Å@@ i , an Iranian ancest@@ or human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men .
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
since officials and institutions do not prefer to employ Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of the national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their home country of Ah@@ ra@@ z .
there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their affili@@ ation with the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and so be hired , since even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone speak the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing .
given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi has to endure , human rights activists kill an alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world w@@ akes up and takes note of it .
the main reason for suicide is depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I do not identify with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
detail of a photo . shot by Pix@@ ab@@ ay . released under the CC@@ 0 Creative Com@@ mons License .
the following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the website of A@@ fro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions came to expression .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
if I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women , who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - are frustr@@ ated .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even lay well thought @-@ out scientific and soci@@ etal arguments in front of me , why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all female .
for example , despite equal education , women still earn less money than men nowadays .
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms still make sure that women sooner or later encounter a glass of glass in various areas of life , and that discrimination on the grounds of sex is still moving across the many different countries and denom@@ inations .
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced that I am suffering from double and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet : when I talk to skin color , on rac@@ ism , on black women &apos;s women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been ab@@ used under racial se@@ gregation and discrimination , both in and outside the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to remain silent .
however , all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices and &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; to &quot; sing &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alized violence , there is institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist violence that we are exposed to black women in tw@@ o@@ fold ways .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of experiencing domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want all women to have equal rights to all men and all men of any skin color ; on the other hand , as a black woman , I cannot join a movement in which the white woman stands , ref@@ using to consider injusti@@ ces in her mind , which relate both to sex and to the colour of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer struggle for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere that has repeatedly and repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is an essential and marginal being in a historic sense . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join groups who also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropri@@ ation , in order to advance their ego@@ centric program .
I will no longer try to close white women the importance of overl@@ apping skin color and gender . for some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them better .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women of different backgrounds a home and distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name .
I prefer to release myself completely from femin@@ ism and to join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was called to life for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of applying for a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us .
Cl@@ or@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ anism : rec@@ la@@ iming ... ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves ) speaks of creating spaces in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped , which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists are immediately called separ@@ atism and exclusion , after reading these lines , I ask you to learn about hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement that affects the black woman .

p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
as part of a content @-@ sharing agreement , this article will be published again .
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a explaining his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation &quot; Water@@ fall Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ keepers Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a sum@@ mar@@ ises the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in one question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and published for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist based in Er@@ bil , Iraq .
the focus of her work lies on persecuted , poorly paid sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative video photography and new multimedia techniques , with whose help supp@@ ressed municipalities can tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women represents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on women &apos;s mur@@ ders in the country and in the region and show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence against Women in Paraguay &quot; by Maj@@ orca . the article is part of the series # Por@@ Ser@@ mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ ght@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected person .
a police inspec@@ tor said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had become violent to her .
since the end of their relationship some time has el@@ ap@@ sed and the police said their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
when another Mr@@ s Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed suspicion of abuse , the A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez reported nothing .
a few days later , the second woman with@@ drew her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious cycle of violence against women is difficult .
once women are informed at all , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence should contact the law enforcement authorities at all .
content 1 Stri@@ kes and Statisti@@ cal 2 In@@ visible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ments and a legal system that has nothing under 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , poor implementation impacts and statistics
it is difficult to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a social science research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are different information and reports that do not even show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
however , the numbers available are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , there were 9@@ 600 ads on domestic violence at the District At@@ tor@@ ney &apos;s Office . 70 % of them were violence against women .
86 % of the ads added to the police came from women .
there were more than 5,000 ads due to domestic violence in the courts of peace . here , too , 86 % of women &apos;s advertisements came .
in the advertisements , 40 % of women claimed that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
however , these statistics do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister Ana Bai@@ ardi , only a few of these crimes are actually indicated . &quot; to any woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on every woman ref@@ unded for physical abuse , two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since murder in Paraguay is not an individual criminal off@@ ence , the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners each year .
by August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of murder in the country .
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , every ten days in Paraguay a woman dies due to violence by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system that does nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the name of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want it , but then she did .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and not together with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red the psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognis@@ able :
I never thought I would be a victim of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that it only happens to women who are too sub@@ mis@@ sive , because they let themselves be deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana uses social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing her name , she wrote contributions on Facebook where she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people answered their contributions , including Carlos himself . he rhet@@ or@@ ically asked if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his conduct was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had so long been dropped by Carlos and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment had at least some complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria San@@ tos , who does not come from Paraguay , fought with the authorities in Paraguay for nearly eight years to prove that her former partner was mi@@ stre@@ ating her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ o te Cre@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; network ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) that consists of women , all of whom are victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victoria case , everything started with psychological abuse .
her aff@@ lu@@ ent partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Victoria &apos;s ads with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , she received no support .
it led a trial against its former partner who developed into an un@@ man@@ a@@ geable j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal battle between Paraguay and her home country , mainly about money , power and the influence of its former partner .
Paragu@@ ays Law : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the indication of abuse is a way of resist@@ ances and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also faces major problems in the application of the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament that was known as # for the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ Lin@@ e@@ Wen@@ iger ) are part of a Twitter campaign supporting Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law makes it possible to declare Fem@@ izi@@ d an independent criminal account and to punish har@@ sh@@ er as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
in this way , the legislative text was changed in a number of points in order to convince the dep@@ u@@ ties for the law , which feared that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , which are currently banned in Paraguay , will be punished with up to five years in prison .
the original bill fores@@ een that the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) costs that the victims of violence must bear in the present case , if they just want to refund an adver@@ t and wish to obtain a safe place of accommodation to the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective unless the legislature provides sufficient funds for it :
in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of inter @-@ human relations .
a re@@ thinking has to take place here , so that violence can no longer be seen as a normal thing .
whoever is silent in the face of these facts , is complic@@ it and contributes to the fact that the perpetr@@ ators are going to get away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must reimbur@@ se for such a long time until mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law had been modified . among other things , a passage was made that the partners called in cases of domestic violence to reconci@@ le .
opinions on the changes go apart .
the section relating to reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence , &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is regarded as a great set@@ back .

independent media in Oman one year after a newspaper ban continues to attack attacks
&quot; this website was closed on the basis of a decision by the Minister of Information &quot; is to be read on the homepage of the forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n .
more than a year ago , the Brazilian authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for its reporting on corruption in the sul@@ t@@ ant .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison where he serves a year @-@ old prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and tried , but later released .
Oman has been governed since 1970 by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after completing his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat .
since then , in addition to his role as the only sul@@ tan , he has held the main offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sul@@ t@@ ans &apos; reign is marked by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular domestic secret services , civil liber@@ ties , including freedom of the press , restric@@ ting human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists , in@@ timi@@ dating and det@@ ained .
the authorities systematically limit humanitarian and legitimate activities in the area of human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its inc@@ eption in 2007 , corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) was reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested after an article entitled &quot; High @-@ Level Political Parties to the Justice &quot; was published in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 .
in the report , government officials were accused of putting pressure on the Supreme Court of Oman to raise a ruling in an inheritance case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind the hands of justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo source : Facebook page of Az@@ am@@ n
on 3 August 2016 Zah@@ er al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , member of the editorial committee , was charged by the ISS against the special department and arrested by the security forces upon his arrival .
on August 9 , 2016 , K@@ ISS held the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j who acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; publication and distribution of the newspaper on any road , including online , was banned from August 9 , 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in Mas@@ kat took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convic@@ ted of dis@@ ruption of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; the under@@ mining of the Pres@@ ent of the State . &quot;
in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a ban on the publication of the public and the slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of prison sentences and fin@@ es in the amount of 3,000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . furthermore , a one year ban on professional prohibition against the two journalists was imposed .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of 1000 ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network for the dis@@ semination of material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a security deposit of 5000 om@@ anian ri@@ al ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) was set and he was released from custody on 22 August 2016 .
the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for one year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 , following his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j remains in prison where he will serve his imprisonment .
the Court of Appe@@ al also pointed out the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the court &apos;s decision to allow Az@@ am@@ n to resume , the newspaper still faces attacks by the Syrian government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order to extend the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the minister turned again against the decision of the Appe@@ als Court to re@@ pay the publication of the newspaper .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists in the newspaper are not the only cases in which Oman has recently viol@@ ated press freedom .
further injuries include the closure of the web site of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ ling and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the country &apos;s first independent online newspaper , to stop its operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Indian authorities are still not ready to stop the extensive violation of press freedom .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Brazilian authorities to :
1 . to release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that its journalists can pursue their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4. to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman can exercise their right human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including legal har@@ ass@@ ment .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ governmental and non @-@ governmental organization supporting human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in adjacent states by promoting freedom of expression and association , and the right to gather , support and provide protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture taken with his agreement
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not even mentioned in the media . this is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site : on the one hand , many medicines and vacc@@ ines are missing in the global healthcare industry , covering the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more serious consequences in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment in resear@@ ching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a big problem .
second , research carried out by African scientists themselves helps to build their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic showed first serious effects on national health .
he left Zambia for his studies in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ched the HIV virus himself before he decided to go back home to support the S@@ Ã¡@@ mi healthcare system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about the mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( disc@@ la@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the Serbian national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
I am also just starting a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
GV : what do you think is the most important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always be recipients instead of being mo@@ vers themselves .
the solutions we get are often not applicable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GM : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported in different ways .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , as funding and development opportunities are better in other countries .
GM : what is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
lab equipment is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GV : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research into space , healthcare ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly from this .
GM : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa over western countries based on your experience ?
RW : it &apos;s often the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges .
the system means that magazines are only accessible against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research .
from the US to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this contribution by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about possible solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
since the 1980s , Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding salad in the USA .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ lo@@ geous , the first plant that has been grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many types of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get .
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them further for breeding .
the patents are not only valid for individual varieties , but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves .
over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to ever more plants such as cereals or cart@@ ons . as a result of this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a millen@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mor@@ ton still breeds salad , but he needs longer , because his work is increasingly difficult due to ever @-@ increasing restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like a b@@ oul@@ der lying in a river that I have to d@@ ash around . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do it now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that these patents go too far on salads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand before the court , no one can breed a new salad , because all the features are already patented . &quot;
however , it is very careful and endeav@@ ours to not use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement growing in the United States and around the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Out@@ red@@ dish variety in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; greenhouse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space . &quot; &quot; &quot;

it is no coincidence that this name sounds more like the movement from the IT field and not from the field of plant breeding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property so that they can be used permanently for plant breeders .
as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders may commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seed cultivated by them .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open Source &quot; breeders only allow others who buy seeds to breed their own , and do not exploit them immediately - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
for the emer@@ itus professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i @-@ Board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over the seed and the opportunity to grow new plants is important for food security as well as for environmental protection .
according to him , seed plays a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would attempt to use the latter not or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement is not occupied with genetically modified plants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , corn , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over seed , &quot; he says , and takes care of the increasingly common mer@@ gers in the global agricultural industry . &quot; anyone who wants to buy good , locally and sustain@@ ably produced vegetables , as is , for example , on farmers markets , should also know that the way in which this vegetable is bred is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without the sovereignty of seed is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to continuing to make their seed available to others . in contrast , their approach is to patent seeds and plant features .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasing intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always available .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has engaged in her doctoral thesis with a genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . it found out that about a third of all the anti@@ trust tra@@ its are protected as intellectual property , which makes it difficult for plant breeders to be used either at all or difficult .
for other plants , such estimates are not yet available , but experts such as Lu@@ by suspect that mass grown plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots .
a question of view
plants are bred in such a way that they have specific desired characteristics - from those with which their taste or colour improves until such , because of which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and can withstand risks such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders continues to take up more and more patents . genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever since changing conditions are far less predictable by climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ spokesperson , C@@ arly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to , acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property threat@@ ens other breeders , as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant variety foster innovation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expi@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to come to the same result using another method .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovations , but encourages them by providing more material and expertise to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees things differently : waiting for 20 years , until a patent exp@@ ander , certainly does not promote innovation .
and if one has to wait so long to be able to breed with plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions , the struggle would have been lost .
however , the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and it should remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want farmers to make their work easier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it is impossible for us to continue using the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; overall , Mor@@ ton is bo@@ thered by the concept of patented plant features : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not really create the characteristics themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plants they form themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a secret of nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US state O@@ reg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i @-@ Board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; he who breeds a variety also breeds his own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures are required for the cultivation of mass her@@ bi@@ cides , which breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Z. B. Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , there are the majority of smaller seed companies to survive without patents - either they reject the pat@@ enting or they keep it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ ton also believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it looks like I &apos;m using my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that patented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I constantly need new material for my catalog , as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you are protected from competition for 20 years , with which you can make it quite simple in my opinion . &quot; worldwide resonance
although the USA appear to be leaders in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly across the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , implements an open @-@ source seed program . to preserve the seed of traditional varieties of crop , the Centre works with farmers and helps them breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them in coming to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and selling their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organisation Agre@@ col is working on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i obligation for breeders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( rules for breeding differ from country to country , so the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot be easily adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be patented . this refers to the current practice of the European Patent Office , which permits patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
an explanation , however , is not yet a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organisation Hi@@ v@@ os organised a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards patents of seed .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; Program for Open Source seed systems , states that the organization is currently establishing a worldwide alliance for Open Source seed systems , which should be the official launch of the official launch next year .
a combination of environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world in order to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report from aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others .
the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a diverse local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context that Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon recognize him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has largely taken care where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role in doing so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organization and blog are the latest targets of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still block content on the internet .
this time it hit the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of 5 August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents violations of human rights in Egypt and the Arab world .
in August , the Network published a statement on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities sharply critici@@ zed this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains true to its goal to defend freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , to expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world . even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals , it has never been as important as it is .
AN@@ H@@ RI is considered to be the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , for example the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the network of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era , due to alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1st human rights organisation of the wave of web sites for victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
alongside AN@@ H@@ RI , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada made use of his blog for the dis@@ semination of articles and articles that he writes in Egypt and writes non @-@ accessible websites and media .
now the blog , which he set up to circum@@ vent the Egyptian government &apos;s cens@@ orship , was even the target of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider with which also Zi@@ gi@@ adas blog is given a home , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , reporting on the student protests and recording a video of how police exercised physical violence against two students .
his articles revol@@ ve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the government &apos;s block@@ ade and reflected what this means for him :
locking the blo@@ gs is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even though the blo@@ gs of blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It has been possible for them to convey the feeling of a state of siege ; arrest , attempted murder , sum@@ mons at the National Security Council , the blo@@ gs blo@@ gs and any other website for which I worked .
2 ) They have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , although only to a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post articles in order to circum@@ vent cens@@ orship .
but now , after they have locked him and that they are sc@@ ared of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the courageous walk the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August . this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and ET@@ IS@@ A@@ LA@@ T .
af@@ te also documented the closure of providers , which enabled internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) .
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites offering V@@ P@@ N@@ s started .
such practices indicate the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking and filtering content that Egyptian users may have access .
the situation is also wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are taken behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis with which it can proceed in court to act against these acts .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants fight .

day after day , newspapers published throughout Brazil with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro murdered , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves rob@@ bing pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air sea to Rio . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the 2017 wave of violence reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio on August 16 published the editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which she announced to set up a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the newspaper stated the motives for their decision as follows :
extra will continue to report on crimes committed in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . everything that devi@@ ates from the civil@@ ised standard and what is only happening in Rio will be published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : it is not normal !
this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the paper said that this decision is not an occasion for pride but rather a sign of failure :
it is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war ruin in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security , there are 8@@ 43 areas which are controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the newspaper writes on :
we are aware that a war discourse , if distorted , can also be used to obsc@@ ure atro@@ cities of the police who only shoot and then ask questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; affect more than it benefits ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira ar@@ gues that violence is a &quot; war . &quot; this is in its opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold responsible to the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated by the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historic and smu@@ g neg@@ lect of the public sector .
to remember : the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the statistics of 2015 , Rio de Janeiro as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is wrong : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are in the north and northeast of the country according to statistics from 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the murder rates per state , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to Glob@@ o , the largest media corporation in South America , which , like Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , has been empha@@ sizing the state &apos;s security policy for years .
the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , was also part of these security policy measures .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decline in violent deaths . for a number of years , however , the U@@ PP is increasingly under fire after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor municipalities that should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles in 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio is not consistent with the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also draws serious consequences for people .
this calls for the state to use means and means that are typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; irr@@ ational bul@@ lets . &quot;
the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio .
one week later , the police cleared the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ ar@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit seller died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besi@@ eg@@ ed Syrians are learning to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the promotional video .
source : Can@@ do Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly due to the Assad regime towards loyal troops .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace organization PA@@ X and the Research Institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syrians in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b in a state of siege .
the East Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly severely affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 , demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition are assuming that the massacre of the Assad regime has been perpet@@ rated on the basis of UN investigations and other human rights organisations .
since 2013 , these rebel controlled areas outside Damascus have been besi@@ eg@@ ed by the fact that residents are dependent on locally produced or tunnels and control points .
through the years of block@@ ade , traditional food and meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and ac@@ adem@@ ics teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as how they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; life @-@ saving food source &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria and are only very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the Direct of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because it is possible to plant them in houses and bas@@ ements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organisers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , who has been fighting for this project for three years and expressed its relief that it now gains more and more popularity . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ do can be used in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ on@@ da .
it is planned to provide 125 families with knowledge of fung@@ i planting , such as Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ do by Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative is dependent on generators , which keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the shortage of fuel , locally produced plastic fuels are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of mushrooms originating from the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; before checking their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
now they have created a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed fung@@ i everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the fung@@ al breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : break of the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
spread of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee making , cardboard , etc . ) for the extraction of new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities tied to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea across the world so that our success and our fight against hunger and the siege will become visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of 2017
on 21 October several hundred people prot@@ ested in many regional capital cities in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of the fires that were ramp@@ aging in the north of Portugal .
forty @-@ two people died and around 70 were wounded as a result of the forest fires between 15 and 16 October . this led the government to call for a state shower last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
bran@@ dies were also registered in the Gali@@ cia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire out@@ breaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy occ@@ ured in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded .
according to the European forest monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas via satellite ima@@ gery , around 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can make a better picture of the gravity of the situation : there is no fire only in 4 bor@@ ou@@ ghs .

numerous videos spread on the net and show pictures that allow better insights into what happened :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people wondered why the civil protection was not able to contain the scale of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ Ã£o Sover@@ al of the Bund der farmers of Portugal declared the paper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do so anywhere : there are dozens of open roads that were surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria there would have been a similar tragedy like in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
furthermore , building permits are questioned in locations with a high fire risk .
a far reaching proposal on the Wal@@ dre@@ form , introduced by the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a sl@@ ack@@ ening of the law allowing construction activity in case the applicant had funds for self @-@ protection - that was an open back door , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ Ã£o Sor@@ val carries on in the same article in the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of readily inflamm@@ able wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , continue to spread to fires of this kind .
these problems add to the fact that the website of the civil defence of Portugal on October 15th and 16th , when citizens sought information or tried to contact their relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : it util@@ ised its own civil protection data using the application fo@@ g@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires .
the project was launched by the developer Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina in 2015 in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and , on this fat@@ eful weekend in October , was so crucial that the servers were not able to withstand the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the site had more than half a million hits .

two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups who had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan became a land of terror and despair .
right at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , was part of the Haz@@ ara ethnic group in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan last time together with his family at dinner .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Tali@@ ban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess .
the Tali@@ ban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came closer and near@@ er .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was hard and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his low reward , and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country with other refugees and tow@@ ed sacks with mortar which were heavier than himself , in order to earn his living .
back then , as today , Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran were characterized by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; he remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , on which we also worked .
there were no services and no heating . we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we did not freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without official papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and landed on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid people twice a day .
it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high twin rates . it is also true that the conditions found in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they officially submitted an application for asylum - which can still be sent for months after the asylum seek@@ er has been registered .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation depend on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street .
and so did A@@ shar@@ af .
but his innocent lif@@ eb@@ lo@@ od helped A@@ shar@@ af to liber@@ ate himself from these conditions .
after having worked for several years in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af con@@ served his entire savings in the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this worked so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &quot; success story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film was awarded the Venice City Award in 2017 , which has been awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
a great deal of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to in@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries .
in recent years , some of the companies run by Afgh@@ ans , including tailor shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his Restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of her trip to Italy through the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pa@@ dua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
but A@@ shar@@ a &apos;s goals go far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retail , and go back to the country he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where there is a risk , there are also opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I &apos;ve never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily if I know my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af also sets up plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses in the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of a successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end there is stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans along the way .
citizen report : Egypt &apos;s draft laws allow inter@@ connection of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in prison .

global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy &apos;s Ne@@ tizen Report is an international snapshot that shows challenges , victories and emerging trends in global internet rights
the Egyptian parliament has reviewed a bill that fores@@ ees that users can only use social media , such as Twitter or Facebook , only after registering with a government authority .
users should be able to use the social networks within six months after submitting the submitted statute review to the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and ID number .
those who missed this step could be sentenced to a sentence of up to six months or a penalty of penalty .
the Act , which has been applied by 60 members of Parliament , is currently preparing the legislative and constitutional Committee of Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May , another MP gave a legislative proposal to introduce har@@ sh@@ er pen@@ alties for the insul@@ t of the president or high officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the law proposition , however , such a deed would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , the legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
should the law be adopted , this may mean a sentence of up to three years imprisonment for the convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger anyway for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian polic@@ emen while demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of elected President Mohamed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting , like more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested in the same incident , four years in prison for a court hearing .
it was recently postpon@@ ed to the 20th of May because the prison authorities , according to human rights groups , failed to bring the defend@@ ant from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens to punish the death penalty due to the fact that many human rights groups agree , fake charges of inter alia arms ownership , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iz@@ a released the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged with their reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pun@@ ishments of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
inter@@ rog@@ ated Tunisi@@ an activists on scanned documents
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly inter@@ rog@@ ated with a le@@ aked action plan . said Plan comes from the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan explicitly supports a controversial draft bill that would guarantee business people and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption .
the document published on April 21 on the Na@@ wa@@ at website sheds light on how the presidential plans look to support the legislation .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia den@@ ounced the nam@@ ing of his sources , stating that Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press code ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources .
in spite of this , he was a witness in the District Court in Tunis on May 9th as a witness .
does China want to force users of social media to submit their ID ?
according to new rules of the Information Bureau of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users of social media in China need approval before they write or share news in social media .
it also indicates that the registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts believe that the elimination of anonymous comments should be achieved in conversations within the social networks . it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these rules .
Chinese network citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
then do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat ? &quot;
not in Russia !
may the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register in the Land government as an &quot; organis@@ er of information distribution . &quot;
this designation is part of a 2014 law , thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of the information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for the removal of contents and to force them on request to susp@@ end user data .
these web pages currently include websites such as V@@ kontakte and Od@@ no@@ ver@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court has blocked Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered the ban Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the data that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication said the site had been closed because it was &quot; an information source that co@@ operates with groups in order to insti@@ gate a political diff@@ am@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time Turkey completely blocks the website . it is thus , among others , China , one of the few countries in the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
great Britain may not stop need@@ ing
following this week &apos;s le@@ aked documents , Britain &apos;s government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers , which would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real @-@ time , and install the Backdoor programs that de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and secret services concerning the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population on the outside .
despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .

we , the members of the Chinese LG@@ BT@@ Q community , stand side by side with the victims of the tragedy and their families and loved ones and with all members of the worldwide LG@@ BT@@ Q community .
we are mourning together with them about the loss of so many innocent lives and condemn terrorism as well as all other forms of violence that are perpet@@ rated towards people on the basis of sexu@@ ality , gender identity and expression of their sexu@@ ality . in China , violence depends on sexu@@ ality , gender identity and expression of gender every day , such as through bul@@ lying of LG@@ BT@@ Q teenagers in schools , generally discrimin@@ atory treatment and in the application of therapies with the aim of &quot; curing &quot; gay and bis@@ exual people .
blu@@ ed , China &apos;s most popular dating app for gay , changed its charge screen , which now shows the words &quot; we stood with Orlando &quot; ( about : side by side with Orlando ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the LG@@ BT community is part of the great family of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will win this war by love , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the founder of Blu@@ ed on his ordination account . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dozens of people gathered on Monday evening in Hong Kong to commemor@@ ate the assass@@ ination attempt .
