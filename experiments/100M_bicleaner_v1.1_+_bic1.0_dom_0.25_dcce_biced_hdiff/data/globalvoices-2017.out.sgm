<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and operated his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, how he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, uncovered the murderous plot of an oil magnate, who wanted to occupy the top Federal Court with judges who were inclined to his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free after Method Man," "" "I was as if it was the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona was only exacerbated by my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said, "America is the only country I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very blackish love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then came Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how to deal with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never thinks behind the mountain, as you say so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He tells us exactly what he thinks like a former colleague, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, the people responded to his statements and voted for him in droves.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican pre-election was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever reached.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, which receives people from all over the world, a deeply devout person with whom I could talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Trumps Weltanschauung did not agree with Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who struggles for her life for the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits to the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with patience and grace to me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise counsel helped me much in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values represented by them deepened my love of America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump made his way to the nominated Republican Presidential Candidate, they offered me a hold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">It turned out, however, that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly whites, gave the presidency to a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for trump, because they shared either racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify the people, one of my friends said, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and implies an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that those voters, most of them know, voted for Trump, because they want to regain control of a country that disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say they are still important in America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commits the cruel decision to raise a man looking down with contempt upon those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "whitelash" "" "(note: white against all other ethnicities" "", "white and whiplash, which means" "" "skull trauma" "" ") as the great Van Jones described has killed exactly what America has made so great." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever faith or background one may have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country, as its president, twice elected the son of a Kenyan, whose history, as he says himself, would nowhere else be possible in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election of Donald Trumps, however, a huge part of America's white America promises this promise and says: hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this I have to think about Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"" "" "" "Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" "" "asked Mr. Khan." ""</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd answered with a loud" "" "no!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd roared.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried, and their voices became louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"would anyone, who is not like you, have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country for which his son had fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps Land, said the news.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan could not find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca together with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cateura in common?</seg>
<seg id="70">The fact that the music played in both places has not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close relationship with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, just 16 kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town which is very popular among tourists - but worlds apart from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now, La banda de MÃºsica (music bandes) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding it with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 pupils has become a central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its abuse of drugs and the gangs of gangs.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who launched a musical project and offered the youth a rare hope of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come out of school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come and play with shiny eyes and play in the bustle you learn day for day trumpets, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, woodhorn, timpani, bongos and the Conga to play.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Trash</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura - a village that is located on the top of the largest garbage dump of Asuncion in Paraguay's capital - play instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reworked instruments consisting of local solid waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under the direction of Favio ChÃ¡vez have begun to transform parts of the waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments mimic violins, violas, cellos, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums, all of which were made of rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article by the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local economist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no room to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the trash. the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a violin produced from rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra playing instruments made of recycled material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentary called" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "(Harmonic landfill ponie) records the musical performance:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of rubbish each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring performance of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra has even played music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries demonstrate how technology and team work can successfully combat illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that fights illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports on international, practised solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">Re-publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for joint use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known then that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia waters before it visited the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comes, Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to give him a permit of fishing.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly, the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything," "" "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at the time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region: it was not successful for him to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was also forced to pay $2 million in Liberia for pillage of the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries established in 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing.</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries that had then expelled the prime ministers from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and support each other where it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, director of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden why it is extremely difficult to detect. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing in regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">"" "" "" "due to the deliberate violation of existing laws, through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can damage ecosystems that have a delicate balance." ""</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail's pace, with which information circulated between individual countries, the actions happen today in real time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that one notices or experienced during a harbour inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also very attentively pursues the activities of ships when they move on the open lake using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to flag ships that fish in forbidden areas. also, suspicious cycling routes can be discovered, such as those suggesting that a ship invites his caught fish to other ships on the way.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such studies can show whether the involved vessels have a fishing license, where they were on the road and whether they have a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are opposed to illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports on the basis of this information. which means that ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then there are significant financial losses for the owner, which means illegal fishing is no longer financially worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that's what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting company committed to fight illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue, which the eight members of the HISH-i network lose each year due to the illegal fishermen who enter into East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries in which the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also the same illegal fishing fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include, among other things, actions such as sailing under false flag, fake license papers, naming of fanciful names, fish protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "they deliberately take advantage of the lack of international co-operation and make use of the weaknesses of an unseamlessly organized control system," "" "says Long." "" "in the past, a ship could fish illegally and a country could say" "" "You can't run my port." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now, the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious vessels.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used multiple fraudulent identities and it has tracked and found fleeing ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, also helps to detect the illegal ships that like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishing practices use highly sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position," "" "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fisheries data and provides technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, so that they can no longer be ordered from satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps build a system that links different levels of information. FISH-i is to help to find criminal vessels with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations really influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch together with Google and the Oceana Marine Protection Agency: a platform that provides satellite data and by which the position of each tractable ship can be displayed globally.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbors, to get a better picture of who is doing what - it simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and pool their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this at a global level." "" "" "" "Pew Charitable trusts has a similar project in which a global system allows the persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detracted criminals but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that had formerly been fished without a license and barely expected to expect consequences, now know that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i now have a 33% increase in fishing sales since fishing boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped to detect Greko 1, the inspectors found towing nets where they were banned.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "in West Africa several hundred million dollars annually disappear by illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">"" "in 2015 six countries joined together, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they are now fighting illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i." "" "security is the goal to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "" "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's latest member state Somalia was able to declare its first major triumph: in October, it launched Greko 1, a ship that was under false flag.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also penetrated into forbidden waters, which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time proof that such a special, collaborative approach to protecting the oceans really works across the world sea.

<seg id="153">Street movements in Venezuela appear to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They act as a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on President NicolÃ¡s Maduro's impeachment.</seg>
<seg id="155">This picture of MarÃ­a Alejandra Mora shows a close-up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela had rejected the proposal of the opposition to a referendum on recuperation, the Venezuelans reacted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into emptiness by leaning on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the refunds of Venezuela), both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments can be found for and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - including in the lowland area of Barinas, in the Andean Region of MÃ©rida and TÃ¡chira, in the centrally located Bundestaat, Carabobo and on the Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country continues to deteriorate, which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezuelans by an acute lack of food and medication.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw in the impeachment of the current President NicolÃ¡s Maduro the chance of a fundamental change; but ultimately, the secrecy of a new election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne DÃ­az, Contributors at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in their latest article the context of the government decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">As part of the social, political and economic crisis, where inflation and violence rates are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% for annual financial statements) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine exists, the referendum was considered the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance Mesa de la Unidad DemocrÃ¡tica or shortly MUD (approximately: round table of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined together, called for a mass rally to support the National Assembly on October 27, as well as a march to the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan seat of government, to continue blocking the referendum on recuperation.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter among other things as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is so far Venezuela: tomorrow National Assembly, Friday national civil strike and on 3 November all after Caracas to the Miraflores Palace.</seg>

<seg id="176">On Twitter images that tell of arguments are accumulating, as well as reports of oppression and abuse.</seg>
<seg id="177">Especially big waves struck the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">There the demonstrators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own testimony against the police and armed advocates of the government.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they could safely leave the cathedral, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop the police, including this woman in the Andean State TÃ¡chira:</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in TÃ¡chira do not wear coats because otherwise you could see something that many National Guards have not!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic already makes the round, which forms the scale of oppression a day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has suppressed the country.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo GÃ³mez with Luis Quijano published on 23 August 2016 on DÃ­a a DÃ­a, an Argentinean news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to take a look at the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinean city of CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano now said in the context of the great La Perla-Ribera process in the province of CÃ³rdoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, investigated crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations at La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the family secret for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time I believed that it was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not recognize that my father was a thief, a torturer and a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was gendarmerie official. during the Argentinian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was deputy commander of the intelligence department, 141 at La Perla prison.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Records recording.</seg>
<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor who was accused of kidnapping in 158 cases of torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos's son, a man who, over the years, recognized the extent of the atrocities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a federal court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows the great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started taking me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall with us. there I was friend of a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">Everyone called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are an asshole, you made yourself friends with one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Pass only that they will not kidnap you one day and I have to save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP stands for EjÃ©rcito Revolucionario del Pueblo, - Revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of the Argentinian Revolutionary Workers Party.</seg>
<seg id="223">That is why he prohibited me from going into the sports hall again. a few days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me I would become a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it was fine.</seg>
<seg id="226">At the military base, I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all sorts of documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, just everything.</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla - all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">At the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barracks, in the cars, furniture, TV, fridges - just everything possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small package wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big lump of silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen items were put off and stopped me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured there.</seg>
<seg id="238">I peered in and saw a couch being tortured on men.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they fastened that one end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who had just tied up there.</seg>

<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building, from 1 to 20 September.</seg>
<seg id="350">Editing of original photos by Joshua Levine, widely shared in social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun, which was published in KYOTO, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "" "" "how could it come to such an English translation?" ""</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>

<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto prefecture excused for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we sincerely feel that elderly people were offended by the inadequate correction (translation) on our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News dealt with the phenomenon of the "terrible" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "terrible" "" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers involved in accidents across the country is quite a cause for concern." ""</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19,460 deaths were caused by seniors in 2005, representing a 10% share.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, senior citizens created 1,803 of 11,850 accidents altogether.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the widespread distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translate, you need two important skills: passive language skills, in order to understand the basic text and to acquire active language skills in order to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators in the target language should not be in the initial language - native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English to French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their native language, which could translate translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of the translation, cost foundation or the relatively low number of native English-speaking native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who do not have foreign employees themselves, can still make translations in-house. then the Japanese worker, whose English skills are rated as the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confused and enigmatic phrases that arise by machine translation indicate that this technique cannot be replaced by any human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling imprints that often decorate t-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery, but by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards, more careful translations can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the Kyoto City will hopefully use a reputable source for their translations.</seg>
<seg id="390">Venezuela: taking protests and censorship on the Internet and television</seg>
<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "Navegar of Libertad" (Free Surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute of Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, 7 April, Venezuelan Internet users announced that they had no access to the Vivoplay online channel.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the internet appearances of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online stations also recorded recordings of the protests in Caracas organized by oppositional groups that oppose the government NicolÃ¡s Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began at the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and delegated the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author at Global Voices published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was appended and recommended the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># censorship: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that the Venezuelan Internet pages are once again locked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the page of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Tours like Vivoplay are popular with the Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been reluctant to report protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission for Telecommunications threatened them with fines and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations because the Commission saw this as a "call to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national television channels I have registered at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">It is astonishing that this is still more favourable than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfiltro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay is inaccessible due to a blocking of the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online channels. this also applies to the website where the National Assembly renders its meetings.</seg>
<seg id="405">Earlier research by the Institute of Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had revealed that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which the DNS servers answer requests of certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server responds poorly or denied the request when calling such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNA lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">In VPITV, a third blocked channel, the broadcast was discontinued on Thursday, 6 April, when the VPITV camera man Elvis Flores, who carried the protests in Caracas live, was detained.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV was on air again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it is also reported that the government regulates internet connections: this makes the Venezuelan access to multi-media coverage of the current events in the country more difficult.</seg>

<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "the one who has become something," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she became ten years old, she began to work as Criadita for the family. as Criaditas, in Paraguay the more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money transfers their underage son or her minor daughter to another more rich family. in exchange, the child gets food, an apprenticeship and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">But what is not mentioned here is that the children will have to spend countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a treaty that cannot be raised.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice called Crimean is widespread in Paraguay because of its participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for some years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Crimean - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Crimean azgo - collected testimonies, researched and denouncing them.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name things by name, because the feeling of gratitude which is inoculated by the cripadi is generally not silent.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Crimean azgo is based on a double delusion," explains Alvarnara.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family, whose daughter is in the belief that she can thus complete her education, improve her position in society and "make something out of herself," is handed over to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family who takes the girl with her and justifies its exploitation with the belief that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and maybe even starved.</seg>

<seg id="436">When Carolina MarÃ­n was hospitalized in CaaguazÃº, her body found traces of violent beatings. shortly thereafter she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">It was Criadita in the budget of the former military-member TomÃ¡s Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">MarÃ­n lived with them in their home in VaquerÃ­a, a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira hit MarÃ­n as long as she suffered lethal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later, the media reported the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela took responsibility for the death of the girl who was deeply rooted in the Paraguayan society.</seg>
<seg id="445">"" "they designated the Crimean azgo as" "" "a modern form of slavery." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that "no further Carolina" in Paraguay could give.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely used in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay, more cows are registered than children," lamented Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without documents it is much easier to unpunished unpunished children's rights.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations demanded swift investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes to court, the case of Carolina MarÃ­n could be trend-setting - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Crimean azgo comes in court.</seg>

<seg id="455">The Criaditas are not only exploited as labour forces, they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>

<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to work and began to sell sweets on the street or on the market to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita to the capital Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the home of her employers, Alvardena worked between four and six hours every day.</seg>

<seg id="506">If it fails to do so, it could bring a penalty of up to six months of imprisonment or a fine of money.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six paragraphs and curses in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice, video news and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when it is adopted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should lay down the registration. it is unclear how they should account for those who do not register considering the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>

<seg id="519">Whether his acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not, the draft "stands in line with a pro-military way of thinking in the parliament, in whose sense the control will be maximized and ensure that no deviating narration is present on the screen," says Rao of.</seg>

<seg id="525">High up in the mountains of Kurdistan in the north-east of Iraq, the animal protector Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists of the non-governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghostly Persian leopards.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subspecies of the larger family of the leopards that strike through Africa and Asia belongs to the Persian leopards (Panthera Pardus). altogether, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered because of poaching, loss and fragmentation of their habitat.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"" "as Raza shows in the video," "" "the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" "" "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem will also depend on a large predator." ""</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard in the wild is small and goes against zero. so when the team found in the video that they have a record of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in sheer delight.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a trained biologist, Raza passionately likes to show another side of her country, which is not only of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School to Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by the tsunami on March 11, 2011 and still the region is busy rebuilding.</seg>

<seg id="544">At the beginning of March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo, responsible for northeastern Japan, documented the progress achieved over the past six years in order to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple disaster" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an nuclear accident in Fukushima had sparked the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in the Prefecture of Miyagi. Miyagi prefecture was an ettish prefecture in Japan's northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami resulting from it.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring counties Fukushima and Iwate were forcibly evacuated, as the tsunami had left whole coastal towns away from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">The Fukushima prefecture still experienced a nuclear accident, and that is why 160,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows, from a local point of view, what progress has been achieved six years after to rebuild the life of the local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of those concerned themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses were completed in the Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was able to see the biggest success among the three prefectures, where 80 per cent of the planned replacement houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of these houses while Fukushima forms the final light with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">However, even six years after the disaster, evacuated from temporary accommodation (in the Netherlands, in the Caucasus juutaku), evacuated to final replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple disaster nearly 80,000 people saw themselves forced to live in temporary shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuated Fukushima evacuated in 2011 are still living in emergency shelters, while Miyagi was more successful here. more than 75 percent of the evacuated evacuees were evacuated to final homes after the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the figure here is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools, who were affected by misfortune, opened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 per cent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resumed their operation in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">"" "" "" "the tsunami and the nuclear accident have largely affected agricultural land in the three prefectures." ""</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, where only 66 per cent of the farmland can be re-used in Iwate and less than 50 per cent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farmland from Fukushima are in the "nuclear barrier zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but also here Fukushima remains far beaten back.</seg>
<seg id="567">The number of tourists in Miyagi and Iwate is again up to 90 percent at the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only show 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal dwellers, it is more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to be able to determine the overall picture, the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuates. she questioned her about the state of reconstruction and also how her empathy has changed against the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction to the article Kahoku Shimpo explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to find out more about the tsunami consciousness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents had taken steps to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of those surveyed said that there has still not been enough in catastrophes prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it is about those who had to evacuate from Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacuated people from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to witness not only the enormous earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was also a witness to the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">From 160 000 evacuated people from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">In early 2016, some more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, had been resettled in permanent replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the state of 2017 there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas, most of the evacuates still live in homes are older than 50 years old. it is well known that the efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima will have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When we meet people from other countries who speak a different language, the differences seem to be greater at first than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often sees that one connects more than it seems at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look at these global connections. in our Into the Deep podcast, we address topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone beyond language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni talks about the similarities between Greek and Turkish; Tori Hoffman explains how the love of music has overcome the lack of common language skills during a trip in rural China; Adriana Macias talks about the time she worked with people from all over the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences he collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="594">Reight: Mateus Ferreira da Silva at a widespread photograph.</seg>
<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week: last Friday, a police officer had beaten him against the head during a demonstration in GoiÃ¢nia. nationwide, millions of demonstrators took part in a protest march against austerity measures.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, studied social sciences at the Federal University of GoiÃ¡s has suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated on him on this Saturday and now transferred him to an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local image journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which rapidly spread within a few days quickly in Brazil.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures is also the face of the police officer, who attacked with a baton. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of GoiÃ¡s claimed that Sampaio had been suspended from active service until the investigation of the incident.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officer how he strikes at GoiÃ¢nia with his baton on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer was beaten by a demonstrator and landed in the intensive care unit, his face would be seen on television for six months and the whole repression would justify it.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desnealizador," a press channel by media activists from GoiÃ¢nia, shared the video recorded by Luiz da Luz on the web in which one can see how Mateus is attacked by the police officer and shortly thereafter.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, filmed from a different perspective, is also submerged in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mateus from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus, who lives in another state, Internet users now donated 10,000 Brazilian reais (approximately 2,700 euros) to cover a portion of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in GoiÃ¢nia while lying in the hospital.</seg>

<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado invites further violent attacks against activists in GoiÃ¡s:</seg>
<seg id="613">GoiÃ¡s is experiencing a wave of political violence: here the activist Guilherme Irish was killed by his father because he supported the Occupy movement in secondary schools. here, the military police of a WhatsApp group had joined a gas leak. and now we have the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who has been attacked by a policeman who has hit him with a stick.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police handover</seg>
<seg id="615">GoiÃ¡s is not the only country in Brazil where brutal police operations against demonstrators last Friday took place last Friday.</seg>
<seg id="616">At protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, police officers set up a stage for orators, rubber bullets and tear gas.</seg>
<seg id="617">The deputy Flavio Serafini, Socialist and Peaceful Party (PSOL), asked the police to refrain from violence against demonstrators via loudspeaker announcements.</seg>
<seg id="618">This includes a report in Torha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers in the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media have tucked road protests by directing the focus on another, unexpected protagonist: a window pane.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Torah de S. Paulo and Estado de S. Paulo were specifically reporting on a broken glass window in order to illustrate their front pages illustratively with a photo.</seg>
<seg id="621">On the other hand, O Globo preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason to report more about a broken window screen than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause.</seg>
<seg id="623">This must also be recognised if one is strictly against any form of damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here too, the term "vandalism" obtains an absurd, disproportionate importance, and the typical atrocities of the military police are obscured by the headlines entitled "demonstrators on confrontation with the police."</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Ãlvaro Reynoso, hundreds of sugar cane plants in all of Cuba included doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The community of Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is widely known as the Central - in Spanish Sugar Mill, notwithstanding the fact that there is no appreciable sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It was two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane mills were paralysed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After succeeding, the sugar cane industry in the region stood still, and the plant gradually lost its machinery, until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">Approximately 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resign and commute to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier's veteran, who rises every day at 4: 00 am, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which after a long period of inactive time are back in operation, because they have been preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers exactly that in MaÃ±alich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, bad management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the amount produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for calm for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are no longer a novelty.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the church already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The comminution of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane mills were technically obsolete and hardly competitive they became unbearable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the price of sugar rose again around a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugars between 15 and 16 Centavos must remain per pound, according to the 2016 Report "Agricultural Prospectors" by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agriculture and Food Organization.</seg>
<seg id="650">If current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), raw sugar export would generate around 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will surely go into history," "" "these were the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro in his speech on October 21, 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the shutdown of a total of 98 sugar cane mills, more than 65 million people received their full salary for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">When Nene, as he is known as a soldier, talks about the closure of the factory, the word he repeats most is "scam."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents were in the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first jubilee, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">These were official documents, which were distinguished only with regard to the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All of us were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve every withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was summoned and the letters became more and more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">"" "Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the abandoned factory for two years and he was one who received the letters." "" "the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation," "" "he insures." ""</seg>

<seg id="690">Recording a song from "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people from the first Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do this via hip-hop, thanks to a series of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by educator David Hodges who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then with Cree Hip-Hop-Group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop ends with the fact that the young participants fathom topics such as "cultural identity, language, conflict, love, acceptance" or whatever comes into mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspired by songs and videos in which the young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilk' Yoo in the area of the tribal area of the Kitwcalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called Highway of Tears, a street section in Westkanada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mostly not solved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motive of a video game to convey how important it is to preserve traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs have appeared in indigenous languages, although the youngsters do not always know the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagnetoostui Cree First Nation recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved received some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars hip-hop group, who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the verse is available in transcription, as is a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on my days on earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will take our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we have lost our way in life as a youth</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">They can grow and move forward as well as our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they intended for the Creator</seg>
<seg id="713">In the comments section, the reader and advocate of the Cree language will also contribute to Kevin Brousseau's contribution and add the verse in syllables (which is also published on his blog and published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers, which is exactly on the menu, are displayed near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (in the "" "" Plastic Models of the dishes "" "") of any food served in this restaurant. "" "</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether to enter the restaurant or continue.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is an entire industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo district of Kappabashi, there are many small companies producing plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic dishes are so ordinary that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend is turning them into showy cell phone accessories and other gadgets today.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the blogger itinii published a number of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sales: new plastic bed decorated phone bands, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kitschy collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few shoals fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food production is becoming increasingly complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an kaisen-don (a popular rice dish with seafood) turned into a mobile-stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo railway station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your cell:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that's just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone stands and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case ikura or Lachsrogen is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there someone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my cell phone with laughing cheats" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appetizing form in order to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, we also have rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and handybands of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Further quirky plastic dishes can be seen at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag #...</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, which devotes itself to the supply of the restaurant industry. for example, with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the infamous "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the intermingled and killed regularly only appear in statistics. however, these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle brings with them.</seg>
<seg id="750">Reporting on drug bosses such as El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, the head of the Sinaloa cartel, pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident no one looks at the bereaved or the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind every body, behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never heal.</seg>
<seg id="753">This is why the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico has launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "dealing with drug trafficking"), telling these victims a voice and telling stories about people who were involved in the battle between the law enforcement authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime makes us not only afraid of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities need to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video titled "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" (German: "how Fear Changed Life") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">One main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches for hidden graves after his son every weekend.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta RodrÃ­guez, who in only one day lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews.</seg>
<seg id="762">"" "Priests:" "" "like every Sunday, we are preparing ourselves again today for the task we have placed before and after tombs, according to the people we have loved." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="771">You are entitled to the insurance of my father, but it does not pay them out, because they require a death certificate.</seg>
<seg id="772">"" "where shall we get those?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"" "" "" "we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and leadership." ""</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this post from Taxco, in the federal state of Guerrero in Central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal, no matter in what form it appears:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been familiar with illness and sensationalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come to newspaper kiosks every day and see the front pages with pictures, which can actually only come from a textbook for criminology or from files by specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the composure.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealer) when he is big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic deeds" of the offenders when they walk through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridiculed those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the inaction of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by the fact that they were" "" "soaring up" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to convince that they will be spared from such tragedies if they do not stir and remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article "Four months blackmail in the capital district: how a family was plundered with threats." this describes how armed criminals were blackmailed from their business month by month until they destroyed not only the business but also broke their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never passes away, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We will only contact you if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want others to be arrested, as one does not know when they will deceive or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days whether weeping would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I must learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">Journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega released the article "The forgotten children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a generation drawn by violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares for the child of a missing wife and a man murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it possible to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, their parents care for them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and he says he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, roast potatoes, make tortillas warm and make "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - speakably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years earlier when he was just a few blocks from his home, seeing the bloody body of his father that had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the citizen's council for public security and government of the government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the prosecutor's office counted 3103 killings.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal PolÃ­tico launched the data journalism project Narcodata in 2015. its aim is to portray the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country over the past four decades.</seg>

<seg id="818">The Fakecheck is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rumor or exposing falsification.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the year after something has appeared for the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication, it has been misguided to portray tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of picture and event - "false description" or "wrong context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting of events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker crossed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tipping around and exploded, killing 230 people.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second-largest country had been neglected for years and devastated it. the streets of the region became dangerous paths filled with potholes that were difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank car fell victim to the victim.</seg>
<seg id="828">Official representatives described a fireball, which covered dozens of houses including a cinema close by, which was full of people who watched the FIFA World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses burned and glued corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to the unknown.</seg>
<seg id="831">"" "an image titled" "" "Das ist Nigeria" "". "by Imgur-user Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.More photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day." ""</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charred bodies that are strung on the floor while people look at it.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here history does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo has been edited several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and falsely attributed to real tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, combatants of the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Witnesses reported drastic atrocities they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one was left to count corpses," "" "said a Human Rights Watch citizen." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">The follow-up time could only be shown graphically on the basis of satellite images.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unresolved, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt of the Boko Haram to gain land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the image from the Democratic Republic of Congo appeared again, when it was wrongly presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">You are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of abortions; Africa Check has documented assignments on Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the picture was presented as evidence for mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">Even a step further, personal comments such as this example falsely relate the image of the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in order to deliver arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flashback, published by the United Nations, those who escaped were able to escape punches, rape and some dead, some through burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported about the violence against the Rohingya, Posts appeared like the following, who brought together these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news site falsely claimed that President Myanmar's Thein has said that monks and politicians have participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image of the Democratic Republic of Congo to portray this information.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and Pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two major themes or frames that go through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the assassination of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assassination of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the picture to discuss how an African life is undervalued in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is important. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe in these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are tens of people who unintentionally share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Is this mood of false and false information suggesting that actual atrocities are untrue and diminish the real horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The distribution of forcible images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that withholding images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowledging the tragedy. sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images ensitize readers and spectators and take the ability to feel empathy (for example, this study, which investigated how violent media work to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is some debate about violent portrayals in the news media, the fact is that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms in order to support the fight against fake news. they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which an image suggests something, which can actually be used detached from context or in a completely abusive way.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, any investigation of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e.g. irreplaceable) endeavours to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world, which are difficult or not at all to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">There are such words in every language: they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well-known today (such as the famous Portuguese Saudade) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish Soboresa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes a context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists cover Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird chose to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">For example, in the blog you can find words from the Vine-clap language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "" "" "vakasteglok" "" "- get your parents in recognition of what they have done for you in your younger years." ""</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsite language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - the comfort or laziness that you feel after being warmed in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds own words from his blog about:</seg>

<seg id="1002">I have already run this conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1003">People with whom I work or people who know me for years separate me - the Sahar they know - from the widespread concept of "Muslims" that has built up in their imagination.</seg>
<seg id="1004">They have mastered me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We don't all look the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves with being a Muslim, in different ways. but somehow we all are put into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">In our collective imagination, this drawer is so well constructed that as soon as Muslims like me do not fit into it, they must be excised.</seg>
<seg id="1010">To be unprincipled</seg>
<seg id="1011">I'm not stealing it alone.</seg>
<seg id="1012">This even happened to the poet, whose poetry is most sold in America: Rumi.</seg>

<seg id="1016">When Jalaluddin Rumi was as old as I am now, he was an Orthodox Muslim preacher and scholar.</seg>
<seg id="1017">Islam, the Quran and Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day he died.</seg>
<seg id="1018">But in the Western notion the religion of Rumi was deleted as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1019">This deleting makes a great part of the story of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world.</seg>
<seg id="1020">Another is in the reductionist images of Muslims, which have been colonizing western books for centuries.</seg>
<seg id="1021">This enticing image language is determined by the dark man who should be feared and the exotic woman that should be saved.</seg>

<seg id="1025">I worked in the news industry for thirteen years and I have seen these powerful, erroneous narratives dominate our newsfeeds.</seg>
<seg id="1026">This narrative overshadows the reality that has led nine Muslim women to their countries over the last three decades, while the United States could not even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1027">This narrative fails to recognise that when French, Muslim women are prevented from wearing their headscarf in public buildings and Saudi-Arab, Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body, both sides of the same coin.</seg>
<seg id="1028">"" "a powerful group exercises its" "" "control" "" "to the" "" "other" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1031">It deletes the existence of queer-Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This narrative has so deep and flawed our collective imagination that often Sikh men and children become the target of anti-timusphic attacks and harassings.</seg>
<seg id="1033">Because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them, Islamophobia is not just fear of Islam, religion, but fear of the "other."</seg>

<seg id="1035">In the news industry we do more than just telling stories based on facts.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Or on alternative facts.</seg>

<seg id="1131">Why can I tell this here at TEDx Talk 2017 in Stanford, where Edward Said, the man who showed us how wars are fought and how people were enthralled by creating the "other" in public performance, four decades ago was scientist of Stanford.</seg>
<seg id="1132">We have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of doing so deliberately and unconsciously, as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women's March because the occupation that we have a new future in which we have no president who bombed the chocolate cake as he has already broken countries and "to other made" people goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1134">Initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urban linguistic diversity</seg>
<seg id="1135">Story telling, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) initiative, telling stories in their original language is a possible response.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices recently reported on another initiative by Steven Bird, the unsurpassed blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, TLS focuses not on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of languages in large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has conducted events since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces in which inhabitants must not forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening often is linked to understanding" "" "these events instead" "" "listening to appreciate, feel, connect." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format storytellers introduce their story in their own language and then translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional story teller, their devotion and their depiction lead to the audience becoming aware of it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions when language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso that is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamus tells the tale of the rabbit and the vian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"" "after explaining the meaning of his fable, John Nyamus asked:" "" "how is it to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" "" "with a wide grin he shares his sense of inclusiveness:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organisers hope to extend this. those who are inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storyteller guided tours.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Rico calls for US re-determination of sovereign debt</seg>
<seg id="1155">With the aim of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounts to 72 million US dollars, various religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017. the March started with the South African Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went to the Plaza de ColÃ³n in the Old City of San Juan.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la AuditorÃ­a de la DeuterÃ­a de la DeuterÃ­a de la DeuterÃ­a de la DeuterÃ­a."</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of rebuilding debts also filed a petition on the official home page of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"" "" "" "the people of Puerto Ricos claim that politicians, bankers and government officials responsible for debts are responsible for their corruption." ""</seg>
<seg id="1160">"" "" "" "we call for a financial audit and a Steering Committee with no personal interest in public debts, with a fixed remuneration ensuring our working conditions, which acts in favor of the economy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are blackmailed and oppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Ricos refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not be able to reconcile with sinking retirement payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We demand immediate action.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not the country's integrated national territory - suffers from a severe financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Therefore, the so-called "Centre for New Economy," a non-governmental non-profit organization without party affiliation with a focus on socio-economic development, proposes a law on state responsibility, as an alternative to the existing state supervision.</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ricos requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">"" "" "" "measures imposed from outside will run without the participation and conviction of the citizens, to be rejected by the people." ""</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartouil, also known as Bassel safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">This year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture, which is hosted in Berlin, dedicated itself to an event of the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences based in France, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, managing director of Book Sprints, produced books completed within three to five days, read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book published last year and is available here license-free, contains a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built up and what are the real costs with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense from our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartoum, the beloved and acclaimed Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was painted from the directory of the Adra jail in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about its current state or place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book entitled Collective Remembrance gives his friends and family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have let us begin to think about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we decide for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of temporarily extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activist has been in the custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015 Bassel was transferred to an unknown place from the Adra jail, a non-military institution.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "military police" Bassel had taken on the basis of a command of the military tribunal from his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she was contacted by people on 12 November 2015 who presented himself as an insider of the Assad government and took note of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His place of residence and state remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist, and currently the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassels's cultural prototypes was more foresighted than the work he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations and here Greek-Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel could not yet know that ten years after he began with this work, the IS would put everything in place to wipe out this architecture, which not only embodies the cultural heritage of Syria but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not finish this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent all my life dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English, even when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked. he has taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other detainees how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a trial which she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together on the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and translated it from Arabic into English.</seg>

<seg id="1250">By 2016, at least 17,723 Syrians have died in custody since 2011, according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International.</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mozambique: charges of corruption-judged director after release on previous posts</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted with anger to a corruption case in which a government member returned to work in the state apparatus after half of his prison sentence where corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, arrested in 2008 and sentenced in 2010 to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants due to dispersal of 54 million Metikal (about 800,000 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from the public funds of Mozambique's airports, whose advice was Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was freed in 2016 due to good management and immediately called for his re-adjustment to the company, which took place on 19 April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement issued by the Attorney General of the Republic, which evaluated the motion, there would be no reason for Cambaza to refer back to his old post, as the company did not carry out any disciplinary proceedings after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not welcome the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">In an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, abbreviated CIP) condemned the company's decision to restore its director in an interview with Deutsche Welle:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take to note is that the firm should also initiate a disciplinary action against the repercussions.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company, however, was silent and did not cause appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the social media of Mozambique, also rejects this behaviour and considers the case as" "" "disgusting" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent guy, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to prison and half of whom had eaten.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could give paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent he has consented to be integrated into the company which he helped to inflict damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradicting!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambian and student of political science in Brazil says, the director does not say anything about morality:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he insulted him I can't believe that someone was rewarded in such a way that the state already insulted the state so massively.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza does not want to return to the state and serve the state, * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead he only served by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as though it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself became tired of this man who was summoned and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeus prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, that a thief is in prison:</seg>

<seg id="1288">Photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known Social Network took their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censored the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or" "" "in Burma" "" "as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">Over the past few years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may be associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically trigger hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even posts in which they have reviewed the use of the word have been censored for their use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with basically different meanings that have the same character sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, it is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae', 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooking Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty way to know if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">"" "the sentence" "" "ku la -" "" "(ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different." ""</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet is of the opinion that it will reduce the hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before removing all posts that are suspected of being racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "Facebook does not delete the word" "" "Kalar" "" "manually." ""</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you are writing on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What should be done instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the adjacent words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (spacers).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate speech, receive a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to anyone spreading hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game, with the users of social networks simply starting to use a new word or alternative spelling of the censored term to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banished from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new policy of Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was banned the liking, posting and sharing of content for 24 hours because the post "did not meet the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their views against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author wrote his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism are bad in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believed that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, such as the Burmese Internet community asking for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "in addition, it seems as if they started this without local context or technical support and have banned words like" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "peas curry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsified posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a great deal of revenue, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Chromebooks's automatic censorship has caused a lot of ridicule amongst users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech, to see if their posts are taken off the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of facebook posts that didn't include hate speech but were still removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "the Burmese text is" "" "I want to sit on a chair and eat peas curry and watch an Indian film." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kalar." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">"" "the post says" "" "If you are a doctor, then heal people?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists, who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence, have increased.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should additionally heat the violence in the Myanmar communes, especially in the area of Rakhine, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for its failure to control the hatching hate speech on its Burmese sides.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to examine and learn from them more in context than on code concentrating initiatives.</seg>

<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the Parliament of the country unanimously approved a law banning this practice so that the age of marriage is now 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Before this change of the marriage network, some members held Hindu and Muslim religious communities in practice, and in May 2016 there was a great public outcry. at that time, Brother Harrypersad Maharaj, the leader of the various religious groups in the country, said that the state should not interfere since age did not determine maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">"" "despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago are a contractual partner of the UN Convention on Children's Rights, the underage is defined as" "" "every man under the age of 18." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of children who had already been married to 15 in Trinidad and Tobago was 2.8 percent, and with 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the statistical central office of the country confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1300 young girls under 19 were married from 1997 to 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements intended to abolish laws for children's marriage followed at the bottom and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring about this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "a Hindu leader, for example, had no qualms about telling the critics of the children's marriage, they were supposed to take care of their own affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition provided for tensions in this actually uncomplicated case, and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the draft law in general.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the draft law against the children's marriage was decided - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent who abstained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him the law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country must agree and let the law be announced.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators posted a status update on Facebook, which once again posted Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the children's marriage was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and no one against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">Having previously decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media users were thrilled, because the laws of childbirth had finally been changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Lovell Francis, a member of the ministry of ministry in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It took too much time and unnecessary talk that disguised the core of the matter, but you know what? the children's marriage in Trinidad and Tobago are now illegal, and that is worth almost any price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson thought it took long enough to complete the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was happy that the day had finally come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public status update on Facebook from Lara quentrall- Thomas, which says:, Excel-related news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The law of marriage has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, votes - 35 for this - 0 against it!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">The Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group who was quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was, noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The age of marriage in Trinidad and Tobago now amounts to 18 years, regardless of their religious affiliation.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The design for the change of the marriage network was decided today, on June 9, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">In the House of Representatives there are 41 deputies and 35 were present at the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All the deputies who were opposed have voted in favour of the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">The children's marriage is legally no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long fight (...)</seg>
<seg id="1372">Many thanks to all the activists who have challenged him.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A thank you to our deputies.</seg>
<seg id="1375">However, a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Maharaj, the Secretary General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organization of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago, Maharaj announced his intention to take judicial steps, the law should be adopted, and he seems to be able to fulfill his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General Paris Al rawi, a proponent of the law, said it was quite legitimate when Maharaj wanted to go against the law, most social media users wished that the debate on the subject would be different.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we, instead of talking about it in general, in a way that can only evoke panic and displeasure, instead of talking about the problem that the state, our daughters in front of it, are being abused by large, hard-boiled men who are opposed to them, "would you be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But whether it comes to legal action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where child marriage is legal or still the norm, even though there are laws that prohibit it.</seg>

<seg id="1390">By mirroring web pages, Turkish users can view Wikipedia contents</seg>
<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA Copyright law in the United States, internationally obscured.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For more than a month Turkey has now closed the popular and on the crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day, it becomes clear how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech-savvy Internet users are used to using bypassing tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the world's third-largest VPN presence), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking Article from Wikipedia since 2008, as described recently in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act (5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, there are now several mirrors (pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and are frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform cleared all the Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (so calculator computer connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">However, the content is accessible despite legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After listening to the news (via Wikipedia), we all started to take snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. so there is the possibility to read the contents in a decentralized and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view at least all Wikipedia contents even if they cannot reach www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also indicated that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansizpedi.org, an irrorpage of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar error messages when in the respective country Wikipedia is blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices Member and Staff at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You can access another URL that is not the original. that what you see then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server redirects the request to the correct Wikipedia page so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia himself if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with poorly positioned motives and washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to wear a camera and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Neptune to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown, next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Neptune's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-rate situation helps in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navarre (the manager of Chitwan Gaida's lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that a leopard would be on the bank of the Rapti River.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river KurfÃ¼rstendamm is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had watched him and showed me the place on the other river side, where the leopard was and I immediately started to kindle pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition of Neptune's nature and wants to deepen understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, for he was standing face to face with tigers:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep in sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Bedtime for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness when suddenly the king of the book appeared. he sat down immediately, we see us and he stares at me through the scarf-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">"" "to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar places the logo" "" "I click for conservation" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1435">His passion for fostering Neptune nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and usually lived in a tent to make recordings of Otters at Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This article was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was once again published as part of a content-sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women avoid speaking with the greatest care, the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronoun or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that due to social pressure they should respect the husband, as well as the fear of the consequences they should despise the norm, keep this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted by a false judgment from the Indian state of Odisha and expelled from her family and the village community after she had addressed a married couple with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of having their wives also not on the name is also common among men. however, they have far fewer remittances to be feared if at all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel as well as housewives, joined a unique club and became the main theme of the city quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, it is part of the # KhelBadal campaign run by the Video Volunteers community and is committed to the exploitation of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to detect practices such as children's marriage and exile from HIV- and AIDS infected persons, and directs those clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports how these clubs create a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her discussion was about women who do not call their husbands by their name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this topic because she wanted to open up the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem that women can easily identify with.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to pronounce the name of their husbands, is a custom that they have all been dutifully maintained and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is considered as a deceitful woman, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about it until this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try out at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "" "" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said that I should call him by his name." ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started their first discussion lub with this self-confidence in their luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then they all said, "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can name us as they want, does that mean they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they told their husbands" names, "says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the breaking of a centuries-old tradition, in which married women could never pronounce the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she only hid in front of herself during the whole exercise; another decided to leave all the touched frustration against him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in adrenaline rush about having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try to name their husbands by their name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received a number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member chose to do it during dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law solidified her, she got scared and said it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Roughini said I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation artete in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinced red dot on the forehead that indicates the spouses:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would wear the zinced red dot, if he did it too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"" "" "" "the other women have not stopped completely, but think that they are now in a better position to choose for themselves, not to wear it on some days." ""</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and objectives.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make an excursion at every discus club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear something," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their birthdays with cake for the first time in their life; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, such as our identities to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things loud, no matter how small they are.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected with the clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only wore saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most, that's okay, but some wanted to wear a SalesKurta, a wide shirt over a trousers; they didn't dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code, the moral associated with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled their own pair of tas (upper shirts) into a discussion panel so that the women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will manage it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether something has changed in the five months since their first discussion lub, Rohini confirmed that things start rolling slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far, we have only done small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then again stopped telling the name of their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, still do it, but only when they are alone and no other family members are there.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two women continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now carry Zinnoberred on their forehead at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like haggling for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini declares:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1548">Screenshot of the official YouTube channel of the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1549">On June 29th of this year, the Hashtag (The Beatles Memorial Day) was on display in the Japanese Twitter trend, where many fans shared memories and shared their appreciation for the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The visit to the Beatles in Japan in 1966 is regarded as a turning point in the Japanese culture of the post-war period.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who exclusively interviewed the Beatles in London in 1964, noticed in 2016 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the first visit:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just barely five days the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to let the Japanese spin through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">It became clear to the people here that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The music of the cult band is "more than just a universal language like English," told Ryuichi Isaka, President of the retail giant Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Good morning! today is the Beatles memorial day in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Also today songs are sung by the Beatles in Japanese karaoke bars and in English lessons at Japanese middle schools.</seg>
<seg id="1558">The kitsch of the Beatles survives everything.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Today is Beatles memorial day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">We all love the Beatles in our house.</seg>
<seg id="1561">I don't know if this "Winnie the Pooh" doll supposedly represents John Lennon or not.</seg>
<seg id="1562">And as it is for fans, Japanese naturally also make pilgrimages to the well-known places connected with the band.</seg>
<seg id="1563">If you love the Beatles, these are your 5 places you absolutely need to visit.</seg>
<seg id="1564">1) Abbey Road</seg>

<seg id="1566">3) Strawberry Fields (New York Memorial)</seg>
<seg id="1567">4) Penny Lane</seg>
<seg id="1568">5) (From the link) The Beatles Story (Museum), Liverpool</seg>
<seg id="1569">Pilgrimages can sometimes not be quirky enough:</seg>
<seg id="1570">Good morning together.</seg>
<seg id="1571">Today is Beatles memorial day.</seg>
<seg id="1572">Exactly today in 1966 the Beatles came to Japan for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">The characters from the film K-On! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road.</seg>
<seg id="1574">We did the same last year.</seg>
<seg id="1575">And of course some companies also use the fan community from the market, such as this Ramen Shop (Ramen are Japanese noodles) in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Good morning, here is Mutahiro Koya Ramen!</seg>
<seg id="1577">And what could this be for a day?</seg>
<seg id="1578">"" "I will listen to" "" "Yesterday" "" "today and eat Ramen noodles at Mutaro Koya." ""</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping of bald people for organics, presumably for disbelieving purposes, troubles the police of ZambÃ©zia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometers from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was found beheaded and part of the organs were removed.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently confessed that the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi were used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There are local superstitions that the head of a bald man could bring gold or bring wealth, the police spokesman of ZambÃ©zia of the BBC declared.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of executions for obscure purposes, are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the UN 2016 to carry out a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with Albinism is common in other countries of Southern Africa, especially in neighbouring Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to fight this superstition and prejudice.</seg>

<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milange, where the killings took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Hussene Algy Adamo, student and resident of the city of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique, said that the local police already follows the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of bald-headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of MorÄbala, province of ZambÃ©zia, for presumably superstitious rituals, has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans, this draw the police of the Republic of Mozambique in consideration (PRM), which also indicates that a belief existed, according to which the victims in the head might have power generating the riches.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In recent days, three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, which was probably made recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on 8 July 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized due to liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion," having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto demanding democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Lius as "an internal affair," and a spokesman tells that he considers it "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">However, China still continues to appeal to the international community, the Nobel laureate and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or to permit him treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the harsh treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure in order to allow Liu to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway and Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brende refused to answer questions about the release of Lius.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came to a standstill after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon exports to China since exports were largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his award in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Because of his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately release Liu and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for the release of Lius, as she announced in a statement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr Lius's wife and family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should meet and receive all the visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>

<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman for the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced on 27 June that the news agency asks the Chinese authorities to release not only Liu but also to liberate his wife Liu Xia from house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "the US embassy called for an angry response from China, with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that" "" "no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley shared that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice, based on the Chinese Constitution and the legal system as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a resolution in Congress to press the Chinese government on imposing Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1661">The Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on July 7 and 8 at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing of the Reuters news agency that China had great concerns whether the vortex around Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada in the United Kingdom</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum urged China to provide Liu with appropriate medical care and to give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu's lawyer told AFP earlier that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always watched the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to talk to someone outside, including his lawyers, and contact him.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"" "" "" "Canada calls on China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and to release advocates for the exercise of these rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="1668">France in France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's foreign ministry in a statement on 29 June urged China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs, regardless of where. furthermore, his wife and his family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there will be no further information whether France will eventually accept it.</seg>

<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislator Yu Mei-nu of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectually Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very worried about Liu in a statement on June 28 and admitted that many asked him to pray for the well being of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, signed the Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised as an independent state on an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association, the Minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of Singapore's only political party because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people commit a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "turn logic" "" "in order to defend the existing authoritarian practice of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices, to create this precious land, one hears that we are ultimately no country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar that it had the impression of fleeing from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very posh: he defended an idea, according to which the political system of Singapore could not compete with other 'normal countries', in view of that, it inevitably appeared undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are run permanently by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once one reaches the core of the subject, the good old lyre emerges from authoritarian rulers, pretending to be democrats, abandon the twisted logic, as it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, the answers given in the last week of Shanmugam have been given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judicial system, and our political system.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He posed appropriate questions with non-responses of a rational manner.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng requests Shanmugam to elucidate his opinion, as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country but a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the effort to clarify this point, provided that he was paid high enough to be part of the government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By announcing his comments on the blog, he pointed out the critics that one should start reading the entire address of the conference so that one could better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore was rather a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the Singapore elections were so unequal, even if we enjoy free and just elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said that Singapore was" "" "not a country" "", "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who, as the leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard what awaits me - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes it is properly associated and aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK review destroys the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "did Mr. Shanmugam" "" "believe a mistake" "" "or was it a Freudian advocate?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only considered an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, on which country are the sovereign rights of the city Singapore go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the cabinet, statements made by Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapore do their military service, do they only defend their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who does our prime minister have to pay back?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our rosa badge?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"Journey of a Decade" adds to Bejahung, Singapore, and has always been a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"" "" "" "I have not said what I said..." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence appears to have annoyed many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>

<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series is from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question I asked most in Japan is: "are you Americans?"</seg>

<seg id="1744">Depending on what situation the conversation takes place, it is considered polite to show interest in his interlocutor by asking personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">My clarification usually follows the standard answer: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, Ice Hockey, Nature." many Canadians perhaps cook in anger when they are held for Americans, but it doesn't bother me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know, there is little that Canadians distinguish us from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians attach a Canadian flag to their backpack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All dear Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans, on the other hand,....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was already when I started travelling through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11.</seg>

<seg id="1757">"" "we clearly say very often" "" "excuse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is said to be the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not like these types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate that.</seg>

<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">First of all: being a "nice" means basically to be spying - like the good-natured, gentle yet tragically incomplete figure Ned Flanders from "The Simpsons" (which has its own Canadian DoppelgÃ¤nger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada really is a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing that you can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless means to be unobtrusive and uninteresting and not to earn any attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be a good thing if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, far away from the things that are happening around you.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of the Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of only our own affairs.</seg>
<seg id="1775">"" "what outsiders call" "" "nice" "" "is perhaps just cool courtesy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians don't talk often about the fence with the neighbours.</seg>

<seg id="1780">A pop band, famous in Thailand, has published a music video that parodiaks the junta, which took power in 2014 and, despite its promise to restore the civilian government, continues to rule the country.</seg>

<seg id="1782">Although not specifically political, the music video is indirectly related to the ongoing military rule of the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video for the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Within the first three days, the video uploaded to Facebook was 1.254 times and got 8,800 likes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video "The Dictator" in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially as it relates to the situation of the country under the Junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these videos of the videos that relate to some of the political topics that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">"" "the" "" "44 rules of the girls" "" "possibly refer to the draconian section 44 of the provisional constitution, which gives the commander-in-chief of the army an absolute decision-making power over important national issues." ""</seg>

<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was also established in the army that oversees online content and prosecuted individuals who have been accused of leveraging the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand deploys a strict protection against "Lese Majesty" (Majesty's insult).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, martial law was proclaimed in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later, there was a coup of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems the Junta continues to pursue is to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that buying is unnecessary and a waste of tax money.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video, it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van, before putting them into an internment camp, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists sit in jail because they allegedly caused "confusion" in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences, they should offend the monarchy.</seg>

<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called ghost towns in Abkhazia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">During the pre-war period more than 10,000 people lived here, today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic for Tkuarchal.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is run by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a corals-pink bridal frame and gold-colored ear-rings in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">It is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2.50 dollars per night, guests can sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no signpost to the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs RamÃ­rez says, people come in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they start crying: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year RamÃ­rez already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also slept outside on cardboard boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She does not want to refuse anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, she buys them drugs that they can't pay, she massaging them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if mum Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs RamÃ­rez.</seg>

<seg id="1924">They have lived in Brazil, but for some Africans who are on their way to the United States, it is normal to make a first stop in South America and then move northwards.</seg>
<seg id="1925">"" "the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." "" "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," "" "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">He says that the Haitians and the Africans are often travelling together and that Africans speak already on Whatsapp by Mrs RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet had previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker at the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy got weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest of Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact Mrs. RamÃ­rez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again," "" "he answers smiling." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs RamÃ­rez tells that her guests often send her text messages when they have gone to greet them or to tell her about the course of her trip.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the propulsion of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to make chicken like Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Wife RamÃ­rez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city, a blind alley leads to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family incorporated immigrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on ceilings on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela declares that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">"" "there are places where people can help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his workplace.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula arrive from Central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that he has fled from people in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to blackmail money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for accommodation and an unknown, a single educator, offered him a roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next step is to take.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa is everything again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the aisles travellers should quietly consult their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, most of them from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. RamÃ­rez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">She looks like a proud grandma in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair-flecks she has made a female, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>

<seg id="1960">A check point for personal communication devices in Xinjiang by Twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Residents of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10 July, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi received a phone alert in which it instructs the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the message it is said that the app" "" "preventing access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">But kÃ²nans the authorities could use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture as they, shortly after they had installed the app, exchanged news with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">The police reported that the app would identify and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, ebooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is blocking pornographic web pages, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This minors app is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While reporting on digital censorship in China mostly focuses on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the East and South, reality is very often dark for those who live in remote, displaced ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and discontent in conflict areas, authorities often arrange extreme engravings and surveillance measures, as well as routine Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">Twitter-based media outlet "Images from mainland China" ("Made in Germany"), the censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where police officers indiscriminately checked the inhabitants whether they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile alert required people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected in a checkpoint with a device without this software, they may be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people to use devices intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment by the rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"" "" "" "images from mainland China" "" "(" "" "Image from mainland China" "" ") also published a Jingwang product description which highlights the fact that the software can record the password request of a Windows operating system and thus gain unlimited access to the computer's hard drive." ""</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang, computer and cell phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang may be a response to the instructions of the city party council to minimize dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government departments, authorities and affiliated organisations, including universities and research institutes, are obliged to follow the instructions of cyber security office when they operate their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A current Freedom House report, a US-American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, the authorities issued a prescription for all residents and entrepreneurs to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards" at local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist" videos. however, this action violates Urumqui's personality rights and gives them penalties for a number of other possible offences, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he slows down to his canvas, sometimes to his computer, and also to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house, which had been owned by them since 1967; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaibs's family to flee their village in Palestine, where they lived as felahyees (about: farmers).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years now, Hdaib has been a passionate activist, facing the conservative majority and questioning their well-established views on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapeseed.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with themes such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues are not only relevant in his hometown Amman relevance, but also in cities ranging from Damascus to Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his thinking, and he can sympathize with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not openly admit it, he has a special tendency towards American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his sympathy for those who are trying to survive in war zones has anything to do with his identity as the "Palestinian refuge of the second generation" - even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine yet.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think about my own circumstances," "" "said Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so, because I am a man," "" "while in water he poured out NescafÃ© in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; at this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a sensing hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">In principle, the mugs speak lukewarm coffee and the wavy of the Kent cigarette in the nose first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when looking at the neighboring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">From this it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan drinking water - in order not to land in jail.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Ministry of the Interior, Jordan, cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic campaign front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front singer Hamed Sinno contradicts the country's cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concert announcement.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The deputies and former press spokesperson for the Islamic coalition Dima Tahebb said in an interview with CNN that the concert had just been cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is a dangerous activism which poses the proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights" who continue to choose "advocating intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement should probably not be simply shallow rhetoric, but in fact reflect a more and more clearly crystallizing reality in Jordan which clearly appears in Hdaib's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib returned to traditional gender norms by shaping his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an apparently trampled woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those whom they should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past few years, the number of 'Ehrenmorde' has been accepted in Jordan - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of people of honour reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have been victims of murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a 1954 anti-crime law, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can "be kept in prison for an indefinite period of time," and for their release, many years of bureaucratic expenditure as well as the guarantee on the part of the family is necessary for the wife to do nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs's music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from issues that have long been regarded as taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "I was told politics," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib attacks the question of Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lavla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb," the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib released a song entitled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song one verse repeats quite often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which, in his words, "that can get what you want" - whether it is faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on gender equality have been censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program, Roya, to later note that his comments were torn out of context, distorted and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but only a processed version was streamed," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib is openly campaigning for the Arabic LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance towards homosexuals does not correspond to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who is still remembered today thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuwhat, who was to work later on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can't Jordanians do that?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemite kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian news service held several former members of the government and members of the educational association, arguing that they had criticised social media comments on the problems linked to the corruption that was rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaibs believes that only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has now denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that's how it looks Hdaib - consists of slow, deliberate and inner changes. it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of" "" "experiencing it" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness by means of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and cradled democracies. at least, he hopes this.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is done, Hdaib will continue rapping and consequently also resisting.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, to which Aman belonged as a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These large, extravagant warrior dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories about the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is assumed that it is a variation of the Tanabata Festival which is usually also celebrated in many areas of Tohokus in August. another theory states that the banquets, drums and dancing originated over more than a thousand years and come from a period when armies of the west of Japan were marching in the northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the emissary, to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to snap a few great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can hardly imagine how big these parts are...</seg>

<seg id="2157">I have been looking for the Meguro Gajo for a long time: two fixed cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebrasfestival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend its summer:</seg>

<seg id="2167">Outside appearance and body care were seldom so important as in this story, as they help to keep the Peruvian youth out of criminality and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the barber.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to Lima's historic center - a region with a very high crime rate, where street consuming and illegal drug trafficking are commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend to copy the appearance and thus also the fallen hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) has led more and more normal citizens to go into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these costly hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the hairdressers "competition" Batalla de Barberos, "which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts compete against each other in order to show who can create the most eccentric looks, as you can see in the following video (other videos on current contests are on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to receive training in the hair art instead of bad advice that allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Before the school year beginning in March, the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only professional school in the community and the district, which we are very proud of, because we have built up this educational community out of love for the children.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the article" "" "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" "" "published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Isn't it much more important to accommodate people who feel alienated, affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is precisely what the young Colombian activist Leonardo PÃ¡rraga donated by the Foundation Bogota and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cartas por la RÃ©liaciÃ³n (letters to reconcile), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Recently, their country was the setting for a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part. after years of negotiations, the Colombian government signed a peace treaty with the FARC guerrilla movement (German: revolutionary forces of Colombia), which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signing of the peace treaty was deemed to be so significant that the Colombian President JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services.</seg>
<seg id="2188">Before the Colombians, however, there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters, who had lived in illegal camps for many years, were exposed to war rhetoric and carried arms round the clock, must now re-integrate into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, which had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred of guerrilla fighters, must now resume their ranks and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians would join together and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrillers to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The goal of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter - to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters of reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak shortly with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">He explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He planned to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent response.</seg>
<seg id="2198">This is how the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former FARC fighters who now have their place in society and build a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were delivered to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on March 19.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the City Council of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation Bogota travelled to the camp to transfer the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The FARC's members acted as they did before in order to receive their leaders "orders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all involved. "it is unbelievable how many different feelings can be traversed in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," told the political student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the Province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrillers live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go, because next to him on the bed was a MGL-pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "and I asked him," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he answered," "" "I reply to a letter that someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "never in my life someone wrote something so beautiful, that's why I answer it." "" "suddenly tears ran over the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat down beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of the war, tired of being the faithful companion of this fighter for all the years, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never expected anything else from life than war. joining the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from starvation. "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside that waits for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices, new voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">To the start, students and some of the FARC leaders gathered for a discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as pre-war and the FARC was already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, its ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the State affects the entire Columbian people. now that we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can help shape society more just in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a goal of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear these people who had never heard of hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I often saw as monsters and even hate people with beautiful feelings turned around by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives is hurting me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - even those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, Archbishop of the city of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians were told that peace would reign after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people ready to resort to arms, to stand up and protest for their rights. and that is completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC are now putting on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all defenders of peace - regardless of race, religion or ideology they belong - to raise themselves above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and sacrifice, as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere on the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent them to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there are no more men in Chechnya who can remove that shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos of my documents made the round through WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On October 10, 2015, I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was about to bring out a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a man's voice saying: "here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I hurt nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "then I heard a sentence, but this time on Chechnya:" "" "how long will you still honor the family, you scandy?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I did not know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and finally woke up in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had seen everything and began to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which cases were you placed - in which of the men or that of women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are out of date, there is my male name on it, but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">For this I am very grateful to him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time in his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for dealing with me respectfully.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked me to return to Chechnya to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They put absurd demands: some told me that I had to prove it by walking up without through the streets; others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Grozny and say that I had not changed my gender that everything was mere talk, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once said my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world that has humiliated not only your family, but the whole republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother got too much and she put a rope around his neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately, the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later a car with dark window panes and a number plate with a 95 on it stood under the window.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, I realized that there was something rotten.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activist friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons, I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help I left the country, but then something unbelievable happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before I left Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registering, without identification, without all.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in at the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"" "at the moment when I wanted to call my mother at WhatsApp, I got a message:" "" "you wouldn't believe you're in security just because you left the country?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know which hotel you are in. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "just to prove it to you: it is the number 115." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">But we don't talk about the sex equation, that's a taboo topic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I can't overcome this mental barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera I really bother to look at the person they remember from their past - that is, my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have remained dormant?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">"" "" "" "I spoke to someone who was in argun for one and a half months." ""</seg>
<seg id="2326">He said that during Ramadan no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not shut out a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">That is what I mean, they probably charge the relatives, these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end require a proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced by blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are the gay men still locked in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine tells me that there are not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives in order to face Cayrow's court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that they can be presented later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say," "" "If they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but purposefully submerged in order to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is it just a guess, or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people in this prison have disappeared after their beard grew.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, that person was himself when these people were taken with them.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Up to now, however, they have not been presented as bandits, there have been no reports about this until now. but we suspect that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and abductions of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think that before 2003 I was already known throughout Grosny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999 when sharia was applied, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now.</seg>

<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had dyed lashes, wore jeans and short sleeves.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of Sharia has never even harmed me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theater in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me hit me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"" "in the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," "" "Don't worry about the misfortune of another." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never hunted and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long before Kadyrov stepped on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began speaking on television about morality.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us per se, but primarily on women's behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless, one could feel how people began to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had laughed and laughed before looked at you with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">During the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the republic steadily deteriorating.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you follow now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">I am currently responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a sort of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teetreeds, gatherings, I accompanied them to the hospital and help them to get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't pay any cent for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I lost refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am a Muslim and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear Hidalab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is, it has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechnya, who want to prophesy to you with foam in front of the mouth that there are no wails with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have what the cabardins have, the Russians also have what; on the whole planet they exist - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus here.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Know, many think of transition to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different kinds of feeling to be precise, different attitudes of life.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me, it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry that I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not so sad at all - I just know that I'm myself now.</seg>

<seg id="2396">The Ahraz region is suffering from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last few months there has been a sharp rise in suicide.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 pushed the desperate situation of the Arab Ahracizi community in Iran, which is marked by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who want to work in Ahraz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had lit himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the incineration was so strong that the doctors could do nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahrazi Centre for Human Rights told me that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have started.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers, who were helpless and unable to feed their families due to the persecution of the Iranian government and to pursue a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi is suffering from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region in which a large part of the Arab Ahvtsi family living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to make a living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahraz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and in 1925 did great efforts to terminate ethnic autonomy across Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahraz region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable crops for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these precious resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population receives little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often a victim of untreated illnesses, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime has systematically refused the Ahrazi Arabs to work systematically in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a variety of dams, which diverge water from the Arab areas into the Persian areas, where the provinces Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only managed to aggravate the devastation caused by dryness, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm-industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The rate of unemployment among the Arab ahawk adolescents increased to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director for cooperatives, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis who are looking for a job, completed primary school, completed a secondary school 55% and completed 45% of a university degree.</seg>

<seg id="2422">Karim DohiÅi, an Iranian ancestor human rights activist with residence in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" in the number of suicide among young Ahwazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since officials and institutions do not prefer to employ Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at annihilating the spirit of the national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their home country of Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their affiliation with the Ahwazi and so be hired, since even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone speak the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi has to endure, human rights activists kill an alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world wakes up and takes note of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is depression.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the website of AfrofÃ©minas. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions came to expression.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">If I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women, who call themselves intersectional feminists - are frustrated.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even lay well thought-out scientific and societal arguments in front of me, why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all female.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, despite equal education, women still earn less money than men nowadays.</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still make sure that women sooner or later encounter a glass of glass in various areas of life, and that discrimination on the grounds of sex is still moving across the many different countries and denominations.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced that I am suffering from double and triple among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: when I talk to skin color, on racism, on black women's women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been abused under racial segregation and discrimination, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, all agree that women - all women - should come together to "lift up their voices and" Kumbaya, my Lord "to" sing "to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualized violence, there is institutionalized form of racist violence that we are exposed to black women in twofold ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of experiencing domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women to have equal rights to all men and all men of any skin color; on the other hand, as a black woman, I cannot join a movement in which the white woman stands, refusing to consider injustices in her mind, which relate both to sex and to the colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer struggle for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has repeatedly and repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is an essential and marginal being in a historic sense." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups who also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropriation, in order to advance their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to close white women the importance of overlapping skin color and gender. for some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to teach them better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded in order to give women of different backgrounds a home and distinguish themselves from white feminism, there is still the word "feminism" in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to release myself completely from feminism and to join the movement of Womanism, which was called to life for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of applying for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clora Hudson-Weems, author of the book Africana womanism: reclaiming... (about: Africa-Womanism: how we can defend ourselves) speaks of creating spaces in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped, which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists are immediately called separatism and exclusion, after reading these lines, I ask you to learn about hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement that affects the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can raise black women and women of other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my being as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment in which my life is neither bypassed, nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2482">A police inspector said Ada BÃ¡ez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner, who had become violent to her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship some time has elapsed and the police said their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another Mrs Balbuena showed suspicion of abuse, the Ada BÃ¡ez reported nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman withdrew her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious cycle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">Once women are informed at all, they generally do not receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence should contact the law enforcement authorities at all.</seg>

<seg id="2490">It is difficult to determine how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudios, a social science research institution in Paraguay. "there are different information and reports that do not even show the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, there were 9600 ads on domestic violence at the District Attorney's Office. 70% of them were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads added to the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5,000 ads due to domestic violence in the courts of peace. here, too, 86% of women's advertisements came.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the advertisements, 40% of women claimed that they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, these statistics do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan women's minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually indicated. "to any woman who is refunded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "on every woman refunded for physical abuse, two women who do not do this," "" "she explained at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since murder in Paraguay is not an individual criminal offence, the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners each year.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016 alone, journalists counted at least 12 cases of murder in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, every ten days in Paraguay a woman dies due to violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatment and a judicial system that does nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the name of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning she didn't want it, but then she did.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and not together with Carlos. but for two years she endured the psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognisable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that it only happens to women who are too submissive, because they let themselves be deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana uses social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming her name, she wrote contributions on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people answered their contributions, including Carlos himself. he rhetorically asked if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his conduct was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had so long been dropped by Carlos and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of mistreatment had at least some complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who does not come from Paraguay, fought with the authorities in Paraguay for nearly eight years to prove that her former partner was mistreating her.</seg>
<seg id="2517">"" "Victoria is a member of the" "" "Yo te Creo" "" "network (" "" "I believe you" "" ") that consists of women, all of whom are victims of abuse." ""</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victoria case, everything started with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her affluent partner even managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victoria's ads with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">It led a trial against its former partner who developed into an unmanageable juridical battle between Paraguay and her home country, mainly about money, power and the influence of its former partner.</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also faces major problems in the application of the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed in the Paraguayan parliament that was known as # for the hashtag # PorEllas.</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# NonLineWeniger) are part of a Twitter campaign supporting Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law makes it possible to declare Femizid an independent criminal account and to punish harsher as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">In this way, the legislative text was changed in a number of points in order to convince the deputies for the law, which feared that the way for the decriminalisation of abortions, which are currently banned in Paraguay, will be punished with up to five years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill foreseen that the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) costs that the victims of violence must bear in the present case, if they just want to refund an advert and wish to obtain a safe place of accommodation to the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective unless the legislature provides sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as part of inter-human relations.</seg>
<seg id="2536">A rethinking has to take place here, so that violence can no longer be seen as a normal thing.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Whoever is silent in the face of these facts, is complicit and contributes to the fact that the perpetrators are going to get away.</seg>
<seg id="2538">"" "" "" "we must reimburse for such a long time until mistreatment is no longer considered normal." ""</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was adopted in the Paraguayan Senate. previously, parts of the law had been modified. among other things, a passage was made that the partners called in cases of domestic violence to reconcile.</seg>
<seg id="2540">Opinions on the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section relating to reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack his victim again.</seg>
<seg id="2542">The cancellation of the words "gender," "political violence," and "sexual harassment" from parts of the law, however, is regarded as a great setback.</seg>

<seg id="2546">"this website was closed on the basis of a decision by the Minister of Information" is to be read on the homepage of the forbidden newspaper Azamn.</seg>
<seg id="2547">More than a year ago, the Brazilian authorities closed the independent Arab-speaking newspaper Azamn for its reporting on corruption in the sultant.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, continues to be in prison where he serves a year-old prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and tried, but later released.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been governed since 1970 by Sultan Qabus ibn Said, who came to power after completing his father, Said ibn Taimur, by a coup d "Ã©tat.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only sultan, he has held the main offices in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Minister of Finance, Foreign Minister, Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The Sultans' reign is marked by the persistent efforts of the security forces, in particular domestic secret services, civil liberties, including freedom of the press, restricting human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists, intimidating and detained.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities systematically limit humanitarian and legitimate activities in the area of human rights and prevent citizens, including activists, to express their views on the country's public affairs such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the newspaper Azamn, its closure and imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper in which since its inception in 2007, corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy) was reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On July 28, 2016, security forces Ibrahim Al-Maamari, editor-in-chief of Azamn, arrested after an article entitled "High-Level Political Parties to the Justice" was published in the newspaper on July 26, 2016.</seg>

<seg id="2560">On 3 August 2016 Zaher al-Abri, member of the editorial committee, was charged by the ISS against the special department and arrested by the security forces upon his arrival.</seg>
<seg id="2561">On August 9, 2016, KISS held the deputy editor-in-chief Yousef Al-Haj who acted as editor-in-chief after al-Maamaris.</seg>
<seg id="2562">The newspaper was closed indefinitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that "publication and distribution of the newspaper on any road, including online, was banned from August 9, 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2563">On 26 September 2016, the first trial in Maskat took place in the trial against Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and ordered the final closure of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both convicted of disruption of the public order, "abuse of the Internet" and "the undermining of the Present of the State."</seg>
<seg id="2566">In addition, Al-Haj was found guilty of the violation of a ban on the publication of the public and the slander.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years of prison sentences and fines in the amount of 3,000 omanic Rial (7800 US dollars). furthermore, a one year ban on professional prohibition against the two journalists was imposed.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of 1000 rial (2600 US dollars) after he was found guilty of using "an information network for the dissemination of material that could pose a threat to public order."</seg>
<seg id="2569">For Al-Abri, a security deposit of 5000 omanian rial (13,000 US dollars) was set and he was released from custody on 22 August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2570">The Appeals Court acquitted Al-Abri in a hearing on 26 December 2016, but sentenced Al-Haj to six months in prison for one year and Al-Maamari.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017, following his six-month prison sentence from the central prison in Maskat. al-Haj remains in prison where he will serve his imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Court of Appeal also pointed out the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper "Azamn."</seg>
<seg id="2573">Despite the court's decision to allow Azamn to resume, the newspaper still faces attacks by the Syrian government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January, the Minister of Information issued an order to extend the closing of "Azamn" by three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closing of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months and with which the minister turned again against the decision of the Appeals Court to repay the publication of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The ongoing closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists in the newspaper are not the only cases in which Oman has recently violated press freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2577">Further injuries include the closure of the web site of the independent magazine Mowling and the exercise of pressure on Albalad, the country's first independent online newspaper, to stop its operation.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the ongoing closure of Azamn and the arrest of journalist Al-Haj, the impression that the Indian authorities are still not ready to stop the extensive violation of press freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (GCHR) calls on the Brazilian authorities to:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. to release Yousef Al-Haj immediately and unconditionally;</seg>
<seg id="2581">2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Azamn so that its journalists can pursue their work;</seg>
<seg id="2582">3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture taken with his agreement</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not even mentioned in the media. this is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site: on the one hand, many medicines and vaccines are missing in the global healthcare industry, covering the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious consequences in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment in researching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research carried out by African scientists themselves helps to build their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ.</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, just as the AIDS epidemic showed first serious effects on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for his studies in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he researched the HIV virus himself before he decided to go back home to support the SÃ¡mi healthcare system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about the misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the Serbian national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">I am also just starting a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what do you think is the most important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always be recipients instead of being movers themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not applicable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GM: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, as funding and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GM: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What are the obstacles in your routine research work that you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Lab equipment is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on, and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special scientific training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, research into space, healthcare (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly from this.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GM: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa over western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: it's often the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system means that magazines are only accessible against payment (the so-called "Paywall"), also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the US to India: how "Open Source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This contribution by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about possible solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Since the 1980s, Frank Morton has been breeding salad in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outlogeous, the first plant that has been grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years Morton's work was limited only by his own ingenuity and the question of how many types of lettuce he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them further for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only valid for individual varieties, but also for certain properties, such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or crimped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more such patents have been applied to ever more plants such as cereals or cartons. as a result of this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton still breeds salad, but he needs longer, because his work is increasingly difficult due to ever-increasing restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it's like a boulder lying in a river that I have to dash around." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do it now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think that these patents go too far on salads." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before the court, no one can breed a new salad, because all the features are already patented. "</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and endeavours to not use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement growing in the United States and around the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">"" "astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten" "" "glasshouse" "" "of the Outreddish variety in the" "" "greenhouse" "" "of the station. there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space." ""</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds more like the movement from the IT field and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">"" "the Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for" "" "Open-Source" "" "seed) is inspired by the movement for free" "" "open source" "" "software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software." ""</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property so that they can be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders may commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seed cultivated by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it. "open Source" breeders only allow others who buy seeds to breed their own, and do not exploit them immediately - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeritus professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-Board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over the seed and the opportunity to grow new plants is important for food security as well as for environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">According to him, seed plays a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would attempt to use the latter not or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">"" "Kloppenburg stresses that the" "" "open-source" "" "movement is not occupied with genetically modified plants." ""</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, corn, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over seed," he says, and takes care of the increasingly common mergers in the global agricultural industry. "anyone who wants to buy good, locally and sustainably produced vegetables, as is, for example, on farmers markets, should also know that the way in which this vegetable is bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without the sovereignty of seed is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to continuing to make their seed available to others. in contrast, their approach is to patent seeds and plant features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasing intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always available.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her doctoral thesis with a genetic variation in carrots and their availability. it found out that about a third of all the antitrust traits are protected as intellectual property, which makes it difficult for plant breeders to be used either at all or difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, such estimates are not yet available, but experts such as Luby suspect that mass grown plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred in such a way that they have specific desired characteristics - from those with which their taste or colour improves until such, because of which they thrive in certain environments and can withstand risks such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders continues to take up more and more patents. genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever since changing conditions are far less predictable by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-spokesperson, Carly Scaduto, acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it contradicts the view that intellectual property threatens other breeders, as" "" "patents and the protection of plant variety foster innovation." "" "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same result using another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "such protection does not inhibit innovations, but encourages them by providing more material and expertise to the public." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees things differently: waiting for 20 years, until a patent expander, certainly does not promote innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if one has to wait so long to be able to breed with plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions, the struggle would have been lost.</seg>
<seg id="2669">However, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and it should remain: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">"" "" "" "we want farmers to make their work easier." ""</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it is impossible for us to continue using the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">"" "overall, Morton is bothered by the concept of patented plant features:" "" "we do not really create the characteristics themselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants they form themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">"" "a secret of nature." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state Oregon and Ossi-Board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "he who breeds a variety also breeds his own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures are required for the cultivation of mass herbicides, which breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exactly opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized enterprises (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Z. B. Monsanto are) patents, there are the majority of smaller seed companies to survive without patents - either they reject the patenting or they keep it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>

<seg id="2681">"" "Morton also believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents:" "" "it looks like I'm using my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that patented." ""</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organization and blog are the latest targets of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still block content on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it hit the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 5 August, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents violations of human rights in Egypt and the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the Network published a statement on Facebook, in which the Egyptian authorities sharply criticized this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains true to its goal to defend freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, to expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world. even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals, it has never been as important as it is.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered to be the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, for example the independent news page Mada Masr, Arab-language edition of the Huffington Post and the network of Al Jazeera, due to alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1st human rights organisation of the wave of web sites for victims. @ anhri one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Alongside ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada made use of his blog for the dissemination of articles and articles that he writes in Egypt and writes non-accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he set up to circumvent the Egyptian government's censorship, was even the target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider with which also Zigiadas blog is given a home, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, reporting on the student protests and recording a video of how police exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the government's blockade and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">Locking the blogs is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even though the blogs of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has been possible for them to convey the feeling of a state of siege; arrest, attempted murder, summons at the National Security Council, the blogs blogs and any other website for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) They have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, although only to a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post articles in order to circumvent censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after they have locked him and that they are scared of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The courageous walk the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August. this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP) including Orange, Vodafone and ETISALAT.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Afte also documented the closure of providers, which enabled internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites offering VPNs started.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practices indicate the government's intention to continue blocking and filtering content that Egyptian users may have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is also worsened by the fact that the censorship decisions are taken behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis with which it can proceed in court to act against these acts.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants fight.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day after day, newspapers published throughout Brazil with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot in school," "Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro murdered," "Thieves robbing pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and air sea to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"" "" "" "in the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the 2017 wave of violence reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years." ""</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "so the newspaper" "" "Extra" "" "published for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio on August 16 published the editorial" "" "That is not normal" "" "in which she announced to set up a new section called" "" "War in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The newspaper stated the motives for their decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes committed in every major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. everything that deviates from the civilised standard and what is only happening in Rio will be published in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: it is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four minute video shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the paper said that this decision is not an occasion for pride but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">It is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war ruin in a country that doesn't recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security, there are 843 areas which are controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper writes on:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if distorted, can also be used to obscure atrocities of the police who only shoot and then ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" affect more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira argues that violence is a "war." this is in its opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold responsible to the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated by the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historic and smug neglect of the public sector.</seg>
<seg id="2774">To remember: the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just its capital.</seg>
<seg id="2775">A march of peace in NiterÃ³i in the state of Rio de Janeiro in honor of the Murael location assassinated.</seg>

<seg id="2777">"" "according to the statistics of 2015, Rio de Janeiro as" "" "the most violent place in Brazil" "" "is wrong:" "" "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are in the north and northeast of the country according to statistics from 2015." ""</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "if we look at the murder rates per state, Rio is in place 16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">In addition to Globo, the largest media corporation in South America, which, like CecÃ­lia, has been emphasizing the state's security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">The establishment of the UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003, was also part of these security policy measures.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decline in violent deaths. for a number of years, however, the UPP is increasingly under fire after several reports of harassment and repressions against the poor municipalities that should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux cited one of his articles in 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio is not consistent with the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also draws serious consequences for people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This calls for the state to use means and means that are typical of a war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," in which a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "irrational bullets."</seg>
<seg id="2787">The fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas continue to suffer in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">One week later, the police cleared the mountain with the favela Jacarzinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: a fruit seller died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer brutal siege and blockades, mainly due to the Assad regime towards loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the Peace organization PAX and the Research Institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib in a state of siege.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The East Ghouta region is particularly severely affected, where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21, 2013, demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition are assuming that the massacre of the Assad regime has been perpetrated on the basis of UN investigations and other human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel controlled areas outside Damascus have been besieged by the fact that residents are dependent on locally produced or tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through the years of blockade, traditional food and meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">"" "as a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academics teach the inhabitants of East Ghoutas how they can plant their own mushrooms as" "" "life-saving food source" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria and are only very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Direct of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we chose the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because it is possible to plant them in houses and basements." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2814">To collect money for the initiative, the humanitarian crowdfunding platform Cando can be used in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alonda.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to provide 125 families with knowledge of fungi planting, such as Dr. Leila to Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the Constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 â¬, but will continue to collect donations to Cando by Monday, 04 September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative is dependent on generators, which keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the shortage of fuel, locally produced plastic fuels are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>

<seg id="2833">On 21 October several hundred people protested in many regional capital cities in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of the fires that were rampaging in the north of Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and around 70 were wounded as a result of the forest fires between 15 and 16 October. this led the government to call for a state shower last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Brandies were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fire outbreaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy occured in PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest monitoring system, which monitors the forest areas via satellite imagery, around 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>

<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of readily inflammable wood, like in a vicious circle, continue to spread to fires of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2855">These problems add to the fact that the website of the civil defence of Portugal on October 15th and 16th, when citizens sought information or tried to contact their relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: it utilised its own civil protection data using the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched by the developer JoÃ£o Pina in 2015 in order to simplify the work of the fire brigade and, on this fateful weekend in October, was so crucial that the servers were not able to withstand the onslaught of 400,000 users who followed the fires: the site had more than half a million hits.</seg>

<seg id="2875">Right at that time, Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy, was part of the Hazara ethnic group in the province of Ghazni in central Afghanistan last time together with his family at dinner.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even though his mother did not say that at that time, she knew that she would not see her son for a long time - maybe even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">At dawn, the boy should break.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tractors.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat, dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara suddenly felt defenceless.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, came closer and nearer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was hard and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his low reward, and went to Iran. once again he found himself in a foreign country with other refugees and towed sacks with mortar which were heavier than himself, in order to earn his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, as today, Afghan refugees in Iran were characterized by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," he remembered in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site, on which we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we did not freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without official papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered shipwreck and landed on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid people twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high twin rates. it is also true that the conditions found in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in more than 3000" "" "special reception centres" "". "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they officially submitted an application for asylum - which can still be sent for months after the asylum seeker has been registered.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation depend on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">And so did Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his innocent lifeblood helped Asharaf to liberate himself from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After having worked for several years in the construction industry for several years, Asharaf conserved his entire savings in the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This worked so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis "success story is now the theme of the documentary" Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy "(German:" behind Venetian Luxury - a Hazara in Italy ") by director Amin Wahidi.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">A great deal of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to inofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some of the companies run by Afghans, including tailor shops, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his Restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of her trip to Italy through the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">But Ashara's goals go far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retail, and go back to the country he forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are also opportunities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2922">I've never forgotten my country and I can't live happily if I know my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and have the same opportunities as everyone else." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">"" "Asharaf also sets up plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques." "" "they can sell their crop surpluses in the market and improve their financial situation," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end there is stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf has made this journey himself. now he wants to help other Afghans along the way.</seg>

<seg id="2929">He reported about the evacuation of the camp Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo, protesting against the overthrow of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>

<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacy's Netizen Report is an international snapshot that shows challenges, victories and emerging trends in global internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament has reviewed a bill that foresees that users can only use social media, such as Twitter or Facebook, only after registering with a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users should be able to use the social networks within six months after submitting the submitted statute review to the authority's website, stating their full name and ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who missed this step could be sentenced to a sentence of up to six months or a penalty of penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The Act, which has been applied by 60 members of Parliament, is currently preparing the legislative and constitutional Committee of Parliament and shall be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "in May, another MP gave a legislative proposal to introduce harsher penalties for the insult of the president or high officials." ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the law proposition, however, such a deed would be punished with prison and fines, the legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">Should the law be adopted, this may mean a sentence of up to three years imprisonment for the convicted.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"" "" "" "in addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger anyway for many years." ""</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian policemen while demonstrating violence against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of elected President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan was waiting, like more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested in the same incident, four years in prison for a court hearing.</seg>
<seg id="2942">It was recently postponed to the 20th of May because the prison authorities, according to human rights groups, failed to bring the defendant from prison to the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan threatens to punish the death penalty due to the fact that many human rights groups agree, fake charges of inter alia arms ownership, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a Criminal Court in Giza released the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were charged with their reporting on the pro-Morsi seat block on Raba'a Al-Adawiya Square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The court also reduced the punishments of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the previous incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Interrogated Tunisian activists on scanned documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was mainly interrogated with a leaked action plan. said Plan comes from the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan explicitly supports a controversial draft bill that would guarantee business people and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on April 21 on the Nawaat website sheds light on how the presidential plans look to support the legislation.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia denounced the naming of his sources, stating that Article 11 of the Tunisian press code assures journalists the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In spite of this, he was a witness in the District Court in Tunis on May 9th as a witness.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force users of social media to submit their ID?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to new rules of the Information Bureau of the People's Republic of China, users of social media in China need approval before they write or share news in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">It also indicates that the registration with the full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts believe that the elimination of anonymous comments should be achieved in conversations within the social networks. it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these rules.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese network citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only selectively in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Then do we see ourselves in "WeChat?"</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">May the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">According to Roskomnadzor, WeChat failed to register in the Land government as an "organiser of information distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a 2014 law, thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that organize the "publication of the information." the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for the removal of contents and to force them on request to suspend user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These web pages currently include websites such as Vkontakte and Odnoverniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), image Board 2.ch.hk, email service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court has blocked Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ordered the ban Wikipedias in Turkey, after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English-language articles, the data that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">The Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communication said the site had been closed because it was "an information source that cooperates with groups in order to instigate a political diffamation campaign against Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time Turkey completely blocks the website. it is thus, among others, China, one of the few countries in the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Great Britain may not stop needing</seg>
<seg id="2968">Following this week's leaked documents, Britain's government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers, which would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real-time, and install the Backdoor programs that decrypt data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunications companies and secret services concerning the proposal, but has left other technology companies and the civilian population on the outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation continues until May 19. reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
