that &apos;s James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times repor@@ ter .
long before anyone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that the N@@ SA has illeg@@ ally listened to tel@@ eph@@ ones from Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a disa@@ strous US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally handed out designs for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years , the government has been investigating Ris@@ en and called upon him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern of judging W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and spy on journalists .
according to the First Constitutional amend@@ ment , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave ones they reveal .
so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many courageous repor@@ ters had already done before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en was at risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
all of a sudden , although years have indicated that it is essential in their case , the demands of the government on Ris@@ en have been dropped .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the repor@@ ters and sources can always hide less .
instead of failing and ris@@ king to make statements , this could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have secretly proc@@ ured his phone notes ,
just like his email data , financial and bank information , his credit arrival , and even passenger reference with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence they used to den@@ ounce Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers and Ris@@ ens source .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all US governments in front of it .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower going to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we therefore put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional amend@@ ment because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as government technology allows to circum@@ vent the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can use technologies to better protect their sources .
and they can do that from the moment they contact , rather than in hin@@ d@@ sight , in the witness stand .
today there is communication software that didn &apos;t exist yet , as Ris@@ en had written his book , and it &apos;s much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such technology is Secure@@ Code , an open source trans@@ mitt@@ ance system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now further developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation .
instead of sending an email , go to a news website , like the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send information , just as with any usual contact form .
they are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government cannot provide more information secretly , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset .
Secure@@ Code , however , is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze all of us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility to show mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , &quot; &quot; &quot;
or the next environmental worker who will alert us to the inf@@ ested waters of F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall Street insi@@ der that warns us of the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to commit crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that rich and mighty &#93; &#91; vast sums of money have hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens &#93; . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; This week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents from the Panama @-@ based law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers come to firms like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s Prime Minister has res@@ ig@@ ned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has mail@@ boxes in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is said that a track of $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ lists .
now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who wait nerv@@ ously for the next release , and on the next revealed documents .
now that sounds like the plot of an agent writer or John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham &apos;s novel .
it seems to we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should that happen to us ?
but the truth is : when the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and this applies to all of us .
for my organisation , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
in the whole world , media and leading politicians , how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and disgu@@ ise their assets - something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people seem to be very conf@@ using this whole world and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ yo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures .
it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what it is .
I also find it interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the USA .
probably because there have been no prominent Americans in these expos@@ ures to this sc@@ andal .
now it &apos;s not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but due to the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US .
in fact , in some US states less information is needed to give less information in order to form a company than to get a library card .
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed che@@ aters to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here with Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really shocked us that all except one of our investig@@ ators made suggestions on how to transfer his money .
none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was given money to anybody . however , it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as individual cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s not about a single leader politi@@ cian , wrapped up in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works through corruption , tax avoid@@ ance , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and in order to do so , we have to change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it may sound very clou@@ dy as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist I see that things have started to change .
over the past few years , we have seen more transparency as regards the owners of companies .
the issue met political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU has gr@@ asp@@ ed in central registers on a national level , who really is behind firms in Europe and who controls them .
one of the uncomfortable facts is that the US lag@@ ged behind .
representatives of both parties submitted a draft bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the United States and globally .
for us with Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need executives in the economy to stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and are committed to ending this kind of transparency by law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together , we can finally end the in@@ transparency which now allows this kind of tax avoid@@ ance , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story I almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
one day after finishing my design studies , I made an end @-@ to @-@ day sale .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my clothes .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me enthusi@@ astically how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are you sleeping tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what do I do now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small boot !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; u@@ h , as please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the blanket and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what did I rock in there ?
a stranger sleeping in my living room .
what if he &apos;s mad ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I got out of bed , embarrass@@ ed at the toes to the door , and shut my bedroom door .
but he wasn &apos;t crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art he bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it changed my perspective completely .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
having people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress with me .
let us take a time leap , two years later ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate dra@@ gs off and the rent is increased . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can make it turn fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could make something to it . our apartment became a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , plus a mattress and each morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded such &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham om@@ el@@ ettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we said good@@ bye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed at us .
had we just discovered that at the same time we could find new friends and pay our rent ?
things came rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if we could make a business concept from it .
this is how we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people post images from their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors are closed when a visit is over .
via the Internet , they can then invite wild people to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the missi@@ le to fire .
but they did not .
no one who is still very con@@ sol@@ ed would invest in a shop that allows foreigners to sleep in homes of other people .
why ?
because as children we all learned that foreigners are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you are contempl@@ ating the things that you can do well . we were able to design .
at the Academy of Arts we had learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before .
can design do something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of what degree of trust we asp@@ ire .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone in your hands .
now I &apos;d like you to unlock your mobile phone .
put your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left room@@ mate .
this soft touch of panic that you feel now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is even more personal than your mobile is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , kitchen , toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked cell phone of a stranger in his hands ?
most people feel the responsibility .
so even most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason can our company exist .
just like that , who actually has Al Gor@@ es mobile ?
could you please declare on Twitter that he is can@@ did@@ ac@@ ed for the office of the President ?
you can return the cell phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a small detail of this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had just presented himself with his name ; if he had told where he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you would have 150 convi@@ ctions , all say : &quot; he can hold out really well @-@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile ?
a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust .
in the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to give negative jud@@ gements .
in the end , we decided to wait until both host and guest had given up their convi@@ ctions before placing them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how similar they are in terms of age and residence .
not surprisingly , we trust people most that are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it becomes exciting to add a person &apos;s call -- in our case through assessments .
if you have less than three convi@@ ctions , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation ad@@ mits com@@ mon@@ alities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you value from yourself .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one tells too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimum degree of openness , such as &quot; Great works of art in your home ! I &apos;m going on holiday with my family . &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text box to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudi@@ ces towards strangers .
what we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take advantage of our offer .
you can see three things .
first of all : incredibly good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
thir@@ dly , a demand that had not been met beforehand .
for us , the business is going very well .
of course there are times when everything is not running smoothly .
there were guests who did not allow parties to celebrate parties or homes devast@@ ated .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I was at the front line when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think about it .
the disappointment that we hear in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a problem .
for men are familiar with one another .
if trust works , wonderful things can occur .
one of our guests spent holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals .
Ja@@ vier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels that save lives even though they don &apos;t know one at all .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books past .
you can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , not every stay does not exp@@ ire .
but these relations behind pure money transaction are exactly what one wants to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled across this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it is an economic trade here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but to call it simply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not just the case . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people put a part of themselves open , and that changes everything .
if you travel these days , you can compare it with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if at any place you visited , a group of residents would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one at a pub drive neighborhood of which you have never heard of it ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star cook ?
nowadays , flats are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments from the ground to the other ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of shared participation ?
I imagine cities that enable us to society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isol@@ ation@@ ism .
this project has already started in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul . many parking spaces that belonged to the government ,
were now offered to residents . students who were looking for a place to stay ,
were medi@@ ated to people whose children had moved out . incub@@ ator programs were launched ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be guests in 191 countries .
the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught us .
we didn &apos;t re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
there was also hospitality in advance .
there were similar websites before us .
so why did our work just work ?
apart from happiness and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find this amazing ,
down@@ right overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da drives past me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this big influence , I wonder what we can use for design in the near future .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washing , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people that look like me .
a study found that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that most Americans would not know Muslims .
people probably don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber riders .
for those who have never met a Muslim , it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a w@@ ann@@ abe @-@ fitness @-@ fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga , because , baby , I wasn &apos;t born that way .
I have decided to do so .
when I was 17 , I decided to ou@@ ten myself .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear my hat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you op@@ press yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a declaration of independence for me , in contrast to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt myself to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not just accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;@@ an .
I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted , and finally believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was trust and slow dedication , deep@@ ening with every reading of the Qur &apos;@@ an .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
have you ever felt that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I got married and started , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot;
then came that horrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking news . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people j@@ umped out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical error ?
my shock quickly turned into ou@@ trage .
why should one do such a thing ?
I switched to the television channel and heard : &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; Middle Eastern origin ... &quot; , ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
it has not only been attacked by my country , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others turned into a suspect .
on the same day , we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember how I felt -- when we were silent -- as deep as it went to my seat , and I was the first time I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim .
we went to our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
and then , I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said , &quot; Be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Sta@@ y in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; Do not be sam@@ pled . &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it was Friday the same week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard about attacks on Muslims or people who were held for Muslims , dra@@ gging and beating free .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought we should stay at home .
but something didn &apos;t feel right .
because the people who attacked this land have attacked our land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have rep@@ u@@ di@@ ated the anger of the people to the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was angry too .
it is not easy to constantly explain oneself .
I have nothing to ask , I love questions .
these are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today , we can actually hear people say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and include mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
it only raises the question : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are fu@@ tile because the question is wrong .
like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumour in the body of the US , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympic gods .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
maybe a few parking spaces will be released , but don &apos;t stop terror .
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to a more toler@@ ant view of people of other fai@@ ths and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington D.@@ C. area recently told me : people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques .
they are ra@@ dic@@ alized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
during the ra@@ dic@@ alization process , one has noticed that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their congregation , even from their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ stress group can make a bra@@ in@@ washing that leads to the terrorists who are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or rejected by faith .
if we want to prevent radi@@ cal@@ isation , we must stop people from going to the mos@@ que .
some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS bases its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
when Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imag@@ inations if one recognis@@ es them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology based on their &quot; holy book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if you look at them , they don &apos;t do what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into the scriptures .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she had planned to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every minister with whom she spoke brought them to silence and told her that their anger , their sense of injustice in the world , would only bring them into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that had made sense to their fur@@ y , it was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised her a solution .
this ima@@ m recre@@ ated the connection with God and their church .
instead of acc@@ using them of their anger , he showed their constructive approach to real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que , she kept trying to join the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect each other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour use of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an author@@ itarian government system , conformity , and prejudi@@ ce .
a study shows : when people submit messages that have been reported to be negative about Muslims , they are more likely to receive military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
when you look at when the sen@@ timent goes up against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two periods of elections .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can indeed be a tool for the manipulation of the public to hollow out the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first but the toxic air of fear har@@ ms us all .
when as@@ signing collective guilt it is not only about having to explain oneself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .
De@@ h was a sports@@ man .
he was at the Faculty of D@@ enti@@ stry , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when has my brother become such an accomplished young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting in the afternoon .
he fired eight times on De@@ a@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism may not only be im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or did we stay safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us by fear , or one in which we can freely ex@@ ert our religion .
we chose the mos@@ que .
with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we ro@@ uted sil@@ ently , with high pressure at the mos@@ que .
I took him out , drew my shoes , went into the hall of prayer , and what I saw let me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assemblies were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had preferred courage and compassion for panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
are you going to be safe ?
or will you join those who mean : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what do you say to those who might say that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a ment@@ or with drau@@ ght , working in a noble think tank , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I am totally normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as allowed .
when one looks at the Muslims around the world , and I did the largest ever study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
if people like an exception appear to rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for ba@@ star@@ ds is about to become a billi@@ on@@ ary business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones .
before air parcel service penet@@ rated into our social awareness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six @-@ metre high tower of 1 500 bricks in front of the audience .
by connecting , air units achieve high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test of spaces .
you can also build self @-@ winding structures .
they have learned to bear loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to transc@@ end the limits of possibility in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to function autonom@@ ously , it is necessary to know collectively , where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine the calculations on board what the machine should do .
external commands are available at the highest level e. g . &quot; start &quot; and &quot; land . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called stern star@@ ters ,
an aircraft that tries to hit two flies with a flap .
like other runners , it is efficient in advance flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations .
in contrast to most starter @-@ runners , it can ho@@ ver , and thus has great advantages in start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the aircraft no matter what location the optimal position is reg@@ ained and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions which penetrate to the core of the matter .
one such question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you .
decades ago trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled aircraft that had only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying worked with just one .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechanically most simple remote @-@ operated flight device . it was invented recently .
it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross @-@ ru@@ dder , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it &apos;s simple , inside the interior , a lot happens so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in the room .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear @-@ star@@ ters . to bring it to flying , I have to throw it right .
the lik@@ el@@ ihood of throwing it right when I watch it is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in pleas@@ ant@@ ness , this machine is here , the coach with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this out@@ flow ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
as a result , it receives the extraordinary ability ,
move in the room in all directions , no matter what direction it is turned , or even as it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some are imagin@@ able in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let &apos;s look at it .
when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate two prop@@ eller aircraft .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
when you assemble them , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , if something goes wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller goes off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further , albeit restra@@ ined .
we will now demonstrate this by rendering one half f@@ light@@ less .
the last demonstration examined synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took commercial micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ governed . that &apos;s why there is no upper limit .
hopefully , these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the especially safe machine on the back wants to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology .
for guys like us , wages are in development and creative act .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular fashion .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes revol@@ ved around each other in a very far away gal@@ axy ; they converted the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second .
for this brief moment , they brigh@@ tened more brigh@@ tly than all the stars along with all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the whole universe known .
it was a very big boy .
their energy , however , did not set them free in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the whole energy was handed over into space @-@ time @-@ structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us arrange the events in a timely manner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 1.3 billion years ago , a number of cel@@ ot lives were created on Earth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then the earth has produced some things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God is at us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group decided particularly brave -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- to build a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are formed by col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most of them considered them crazy .
but enough people recognized it as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea .
after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work , they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves @-@ observ@@ atory .
in the following period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be considerably increased , which greatly improved the recognition capacity .
that is why it is now called Advanced Lig@@ o .
in the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was started for a final test run in order to clarify some minor , stub@@ born problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , just a few days after the start of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ro@@ amed through the earth through the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the farewell from my sick father .
basically these were the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : that &apos;s my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes for 23 years and her through observ@@ atories as lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ?
a wave of gravity is a ri@@ pp@@ le in the structure of space and time .
when moving the shaft , the space and its contents are stretched in one direction and into the other .
for illustr@@ ative purposes , lec@@ turers often perform a really alpine dance in courses on the theory of rel@@ ativity .
&quot; stretch and st@@ ow , stretch and st@@ ow . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and squee@@ zed at the meeting of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this means 20 zer@@ os after comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . that &apos;s why the Lig@@ o employees declared it crazy .
with a five kilometre long laser detector , and that &apos;s already absurd , that length should be measured on less than one thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nucle@@ us . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne released this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite practical , because so you can create an image or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you .
sounds are different in tones .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually , impossible to produce a picture of things that can mean you a lot :
your child &apos;s face approximately .
instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume in order to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now is Alice talking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob is breaking them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; du@@ mmer Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
with them we cannot make simple images of objects in space .
but by paying attention to changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies lie in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe speak .
the gravity to listen can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with what my colleague Scott has been working for quite a long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just wrap : w@@ up@@ p !
turn the two bodies fast , you hear the same p@@ ant@@ y with an additional key change . you can get the wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed in the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ des noise &#93; No one who knows what to listen to , recognizes this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rotate approximately as quickly as the bars of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s briefly consider what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ves one hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we have heard it .
in this there is the permanent meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to resear@@ ching the universe as it has never been possible before .
on this road we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
we can &apos;t see much in space -- practically or basically -- not .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ c stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ as .
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about the universe .
but the exciting physical processes happen in the nucle@@ us that lies hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through as these are op@@ ak .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penetrate the iron , as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them , because the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own after@@ glow .
with gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and probably the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that there exist in all things that we have never seen , which we will never see and of which we have no idea at all . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt , which we had not expected .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , such as Lig@@ o watches , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are , so to speak , the sour bones for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different perspective on the happ@@ enings in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately how we came out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and cir@@ cling of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried out an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be on TV live ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I was afraid of , my fear brush@@ ed away .
my fear of talking speeches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed my life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was a definite yes that deeply changed my life , on an unexpected kind . it began with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three unbelievable daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , names all the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I need milk for my um@@ bili@@ cal cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this yes was the beginning
from then on , I swear to play with them whenever you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I am not perfect , but I am very tired .
it has a magic effect on me , my children , our family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play with my children saved my career . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I am thinking of things , awaken you to life .
a dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
a dream job .
I created television . I produced television .
I am making television , in great style .
in this TV season I am responsible for bringing 70 hours of program into the world .
four television programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows simultaneously are in production .
each shipment provides hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode , every nine days , four shows , four television programs , 70 hours of television , four television programs , 70 hours of TV , three programmes simultaneously in production , at the same time four , 16 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series are run one after the other on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series in 256 regions run in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts I have created myself and not only produced , so still on top . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around camp fire and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire that are burning around the world .
do you know who is doing that ?
no one , therefore I am a Titan .
a dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with that .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you that all of you who work so hard , whether you run a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a budget , take me seriously when I talk about work , so that you understand that I &apos;m not just playing around on the computer and f@@ antasi@@ es , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it &apos;s not about dreams in a dream job .
it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m en@@ gros@@ sed in the work , there &apos;s no other feeling .
my work always creates a land out of nowhere .
it is as if I set up troops as if I painted on a canvas .
as soon as you see a high sound , deliver a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible . and the best thing about it is the sum .
there is such a change in me when work is going well .
a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz li@@ stens like a busy street , I could drive on it forever .
many people accept when I explain to them the sums that I talk about writing that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t get me wrong , that &apos;s what she does .
but the sum -- when I began to work and work with the TV production , when I began to work and work , to create , create and work together , I discovered this thing , this sums , this energy . the tot@@ als !
the sum is more than writing .
the sum is action and activity . the sum is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the h@@ um is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz , then you won &apos;t be able to do anything other than your size .
the feeling of not being able to do otherwise than to strive for size , no matter what price .
this is called the sum .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it &apos;s a genius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it &apos;s the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I just know that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I just know that I love the tot@@ als .
I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
in order to make it clear : the more I become , the more broad@@ casts , the more episodes , the more work there are , the more things the more I write , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound , the sum , the sum , the sum .
I like this bu@@ zz . I love the h@@ um .
I need the sums . I am the sum .
am I only this sum ?
and then the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
revised , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burnt out .
the sum was hal@@ ted .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mo@@ m is a single working title .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um won &apos;t be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the bu@@ zz@@ ing ceased .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of the engine was silent .
I didn &apos;t love my work anymore . the engine was off .
the sum did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ anic work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing to deleg@@ ate , a Titan sleeps not , does not give up , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no h@@ um .
in me was silence .
four television programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four television programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
all I did .
I was the sum and the sum I was .
so what do you do if what you are doing , the work that you love suddenly fade away ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Look , stupid author @-@ titanium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do it , you do it , you love what you are doing , you love being a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , one loves to be a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives you the bu@@ zz if you know the tot@@ als when the h@@ um stops , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern state wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no , when two things become clear to me :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and second , she did not call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she does not call anybody &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did that happen ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hate it when I am Titan and ro@@ b my bu@@ zz , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot;
there is nothing special about this .
we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding , because my pain and my panic , in the lon@@ el@@ iness and the lack of the sum , I can do nothing except fitting out .
I am focused .
I am silent .
the land I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high tone - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it &apos;s all about letting go , or whatever the girl is releasing in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something inside me solves .
a mental door enters and an energy shift comes in .
and that does not immediately , but it happens it happens .
I feel it .
the sum is slowly coming back .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the sum , but a sum .
and now I feel like I know a magic secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sum , the sums of work , the titanium dioxide , that &apos;s just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself by means of broad@@ casts and television hours and how functioning my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is .
the sum is not a force and it is not work @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz is dependent on love .
the sum is the stream that comes from the z@@ est of life .
the real bu@@ zz is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real sum ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words to me , because what God told me I am a titanium ?
it &apos;s just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a permanent rule , so that I can free myself from any blame as a work@@ ah@@ olic .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the sum again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
I don &apos;t like to play in such a way as to work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer working at work than at home .
this admission is painful , because what kind of person is better to be than home ?
well , yes , I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is not one of them .
we fly around in the garden , before and forth , back and forth .
we do small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
I feel overwhel@@ m@@ ingly stiff , absent and confused .
I always take my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
my children show me how to live , and the sum of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why did we ever stop playing ?
you can also do it ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you think me is na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you are right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and you know why ? you &apos;re not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or bis@@ cuit will replace me .
and talking to my teen@@ age daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , more need not .
everyone can spend 15 minutes on the track , even on a bad day !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile phone , no linen , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are getting ready .
but there are 15 minutes in it !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is important to feel the h@@ um , to have a place for his peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; around the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and keep it out .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I win . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is just about anything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more .
15 minutes a bit , why not allow yourself in 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working does not work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the h@@ um , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sum , the sum is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my sum .
the sum of life .
the sum of love .
the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part of it . and I am so grateful for that .
it &apos;s snow@@ ing to me that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , who plays a trip to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and to more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clearer is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sums . the land I create , the marathon , which I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high sound , the sums , the sums , the other , the right sums : the sums of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , consistent , bare and new feeling of being alive within me spreads .
the more I feel this sum , the more I know who I am .
I am a writer . I am thinking of things , I stir you to life .
that is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a bit dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and to more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have every day to do with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to another after a heavy stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low capacity for self @-@ healing .
after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor trying to improve the nerve functions by means of various surgical techniques .
they have heard of one of the best known , &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; in doing so , an electrode is im@@ planted deep in the brain to influence the neur@@ ons circu@@ it@@ ry in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function is improved .
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease , which suffered from violent trem@@ ors and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation however does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help , the brain can help itself .
history started 15 years ago .
at the time I was a senior physician and worked night and night in the emergency room .
often I supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ mas .
they have to imagine that the brain sw@@ ells and increases the cran@@ ial pressure in skull @-@ brain trau@@ mas .
in order to save life , it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull .
for this you sometimes have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
being able to grow cells from a piece of tissue is comparable to very small children who are taken out of their families .
proper nutrition , temperature , humidity and environments must be found in order to thri@@ ve .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts it was Jean @-@ François .
he saw that under his micro@@ scope .
that was a great surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can turn into any cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operating room .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they divide themselves very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they par@@ ted slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed long to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the fet@@ us stage , they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay ?
we don &apos;t know that .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain because we find it in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
this is not so certain .
one thing , however , is clear -- we received our stem cells from these cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non @-@ language area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did by Jean @-@ François .
and then color them in color to be able to follow them in the brain .
in the last step , we re @-@ imported it at the point of view of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we have re @-@ reim@@ plant@@ ation these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we have re @-@ reim@@ plant@@ ated the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler , we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario we imported the cells into a healthy brain and we observed that after a few weeks they completely disappeared as if they had been removed again , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added an injury and re @-@ imported exactly the same cells and now the cells remained - they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you can see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells which have been re @-@ imported .
the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells that we color in vitro , in culture .
of course we couldn &apos;t stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from brain injury ?
so we trained apes with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take feed pellets from a tray .
they made it very good .
when they reached a stable level of skill , we injured the motor skills area in the motor cor@@ tex .
as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand .
just as it would happen in humans , they recovered spontaneously to some degree , just like after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover at some degree , just like the monkeys .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached his level of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left side they see the monkey , who recovered spontaneously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance prior to the injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
look now , when we re @-@ her@@ al@@ ded the re @-@ reim@@ plant@@ ations : the same monkey , two months after the plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze it and use it later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to implant it in humans .
I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno Giuss@@ ani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials on humans .
Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results , you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authorities allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment .
after that , it is necessary to apply this to a multi@@ center study .
you first have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a great mistake to consider it a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to look at it as an imm@@ utable fact .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved dou@@ bt@@ lessly that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and an impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
democracy is in fact van@@ ishing with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistak@@ ably made clear to me as finance minister in the Euro Group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece .
at that moment , I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my ad@@ orable friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro Group are mistaken , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ ant democracy .
for without democracy our societies are mur@@ der@@ ers , our future glo@@ omy and our great new technologies wasted .
on the topic of waste , I would like to point out to you an interesting contradiction which currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin summit parad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt , which casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the mountain of debt ,
but few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unused cash , which belongs to the wealthy depos@@ itors and corporations , but they are too sc@@ ared to invest there where it would be productive and income , with which one could pay the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs , such as &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past three months , US , England and the euro@@ zone have spent 3.8 billion US dollars , in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , railway tracks , equipment and so on and so on and so on .
3.4 billion US dollars will sound after a lot of money , until you compare it with the $ 5.1 billion that were at the same time lying around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did absolutely nothing to infl@@ ate the stock markets and put up real estate prices .
thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks that are not offset by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low total economic demand , which , as in an endless loop , enhances the pes@@ si@@ mis@@ m of the investors , in which they do not invest .
un@@ intentionally bring about the circumstances that cause the body to kill him .
this is my hair with capitalism --
his exceedingly lav@@ ish art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to further develop human talents and to finance particularly all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies which are decisive for the salvation of the earth .
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue , what do we mean under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government .
of course , the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy included too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy on the basis of these exclu@@ sions .
the decisive factor in the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it involved the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which they granted them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal weight wei@@ ghting in matters of state concerns .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian Democracy did not last long --
like a candle that shines brigh@@ tly , it is quickly burned out .
however , today &apos;s liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies have not roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a statute for rulers .
for liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- that is , the world of the corporations -- became a democratic zone .
in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and the economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two takes place , by gradually sub@@ stit@@ uting the policy and escap@@ ing it .
do you wonder why the politicians are no longer as they were before ?
it is not on a degeneration of their DNA .
it is because nowadays it is possible to be in the government and still not in power because the power of politics has mig@@ rated to the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
if you think about it , it &apos;s like a herd of pre@@ dat@@ ors that have so sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals from which it feeds , that they end up star@@ ving at the end .
similarly , it is with the economy that has can@@ ni@@ bal@@ ized politics so far that it har@@ ms itself by the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of corporations grows , political goods are depreci@@ ated , the ine@@ quality rises , the macro@@ economic demand falls , and the managing directors of the corporations are frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism markets the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the wa@@ sting of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind .
if that is true , it is obvious that we have to bring the politics and the economy back together , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; keeps control , as in ancient Athens , except for the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it didn &apos;t look very well .
the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the labor@@ ing poor regain a position just as in ancient Athens without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
but there is a solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers with automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation lets the twin peaks become higher , the waste more sub@@ lime , and the social conflicts deeper , just as I believe -- in countries like China will come .
so we must resh@@ ape the economy and re@@ unite the spheres of economics and politics , and make sure that we democr@@ ati@@ se the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; like a documentary .
the question therefore is not whether capitalism will survive the technical conqu@@ ests that it has brought forth --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; matrix , &quot; or by something that resembles the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines are used in the exploration of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Athens &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long conversations the meaning of life .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
so what would it be like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples .
in the company : please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while working and where your capital follows you from one job to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one currently works -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company .
then all income comes from capital and from redemption and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ taken .
no distinction between those belonging to companies , but they do not work in it , and employees who work there , but which the company does not belong to . no more exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no to@@ wering twin peaks .
in the sphere of global political economy , please briefly point out that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a mutual fund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed at the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time one did not have the technical means to implement it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , we have them , especially against the background of a re@@ unified politics and economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world I describe to you is at the same time the secretary in which she pre@@ fers privileged people , and Mar@@ xi@@ an because it will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , globally Key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all else , it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or are we going to sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide politically together .
it is in our hands and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Giuss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
in your biography you describe yourself as a liberal Marxist .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and the economy is ... Do we not do this , technological development will produce such a massive drop in macro@@ economic demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers referred to as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the earth to the next as we are currently experiencing it will dest@@ abili@@ ze not only our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant ,
just like Ha@@ ye@@ k , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and so I am totally mad .
BG : actually , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you are not confused , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said that . BG : in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner by the or@@ ators you have said very clearly what you think of the West &apos;s view in China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of a democracy .
as I said in my speech , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it is playing -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone .
in a sense , when I may say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically regarded .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was especially scep@@ tical about democratic development .
what one can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
to blame China now to do what the West has done itself in the 19th century smells immen@@ sely after hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I sen@@ sed that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later to the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone ,
not only Greece but the Eurozone ,
namely saying good@@ bye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency and the permanent den@@ ial that a massive fault line went through the Eurozone and continues to thre@@ aten the development of the whole European Union .
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which , by the way , was the first suggestion that revealed this den@@ ial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the Euro Group , have also chosen the den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the Soviet Union &apos;s experience --
if you try to keep an economic system that is not viable , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , you might be able to delay it for a while , but when the change occurs it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you anticipate ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes during your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Ernst ...
if there is a minister of finance , or any minister who , after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , claims he has made no mistake , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extending the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the side of the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but that did not exist .
they just wanted to bring our government down , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the distor@@ tions running through the euro@@ zone .
they did not want to admit that they had been carrying out a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika , who imposed this policy on us , admitted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive sound of talks , you seem to be still pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive .
for if it does not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not have disa@@ strous consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it appears to me , it will also be det@@ ri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope you &apos;re wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being at TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
of Roy Price , most of them have never heard before , although he is likely to be responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy did three years ago .
Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studios ,
the Amazon TV production company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a hed@@ geho@@ g and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Films , TV , Techni@@ cs , Tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought branch .
there are so many TV shows that Roy can &apos;t select any one .
he must find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are on the right side of this curve .
this graph is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows will receive this review .
if your show is valued with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Break@@ ing Bad &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; your brain asks : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy Price does not worry about getting on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to sign &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he gets more thoughts about the middle training , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t inspire .
so he has to make sure that he really is on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes such a thing , so Roy Price does not want to risk anything .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows by evaluating eight candidates , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online where they can watch them for free .
and if Amazon gives out for free , you don &apos;t have to use it properly ?
millions of spectators watch these episodes .
however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows .
you are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you can record when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you skip or look again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and get the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they did this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good .
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,@@ 4 and Alpha House hits 7.5 -- so something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always on the look@@ out to find this super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different .
instead of organizing a competition , he and his team looked at the available data on the Net@@ fli@@ x Viewer , so the reviews they give the shows , the course of which shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the spectators : what shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has hit a hit with it , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this turn . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
one has two very competitive , data @-@ sealed companies .
they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this about ?
because logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , then you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
you optimize it through very powerful computers .
what you can expect is good television , right ?
if data analysis does not work , then this is somewhat frigh@@ tening , because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond TV .
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software . come in touch , you are in prison .
if someone is in prison here in the U.S. and asks for discharge , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge takes place or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always producing the best results . it &apos;s not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the most experienced companies are wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that due to data analysis , it could predict out@@ breaks of flu , a bad way -- by analy@@ sing Google searches .
it worked wonderfully well and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the journal Nature .
it worked flaw@@ lessly , year around year , until it suddenly stopped working ,
and no one could say why .
it simply didn &apos;t work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the journal Nature .
even the most experienced firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data inf@@ lows into decisions of life -- at work , in law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very wise people use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for cancer therapy
over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dissemin@@ ated .
do you ever have to solve a complex problem , mainly two things :
first , you disman@@ tle this problem into its components so that you can analyse the items ; as a second , put the items together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help dis@@ assemble a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all own it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces to be put together again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to get a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
therefore , I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and mind , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they wouldn &apos;t have been able to do otherwise . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show such as &quot; House of Cards &quot; was not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first when they were competing for TV ideas when they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data is just a tool , and in order not to forget this , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , it was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it &apos;s also called Magic 8 Ball . it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ w or No question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will try it later with a technical demonstration .
I &apos;ve made some decisions in my life so far , I should have heard in hin@@ d@@ sight on the ball .
but , as you know , if you have the data available , you want to replace them with a bit more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not alter the basic structure .
so maybe the ball will be smar@@ ter and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this very encouraging news that despite the huge amount of data , it still pays off to make decisions , to be an expert in what you are doing and taking risks .
because in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
