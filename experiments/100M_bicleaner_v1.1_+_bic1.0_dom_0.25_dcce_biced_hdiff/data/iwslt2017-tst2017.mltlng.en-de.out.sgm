<seg id="1">That's James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA has illegally listened to telephones from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a disastrous US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally handed out designs for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government has been investigating Risen and called upon him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern of judging Whistleblower and spy on journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional amendment, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave ones they reveal.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters had already done before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen was at risk of going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">All of a sudden, although years have indicated that it is essential in their case, the demands of the government on Risen have been dropped.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, the reporters and sources can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failing and risking to make statements, this could also do his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, have secretly procured his phone notes,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his email data, financial and bank information, his credit arrival, and even passenger reference with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence they used to denounce Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistle-blowers and Risens source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments in front of it.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower going to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "we therefore put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional amendment because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on everyone." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as government technology allows to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And they can do that from the moment they contact, rather than in hindsight, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software that didn't exist yet, as Risen had written his book, and it's much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureCode, an open source transmittance system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is now further developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news website, like the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, just as with any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">They are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot provide more information secretly, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureCode, however, is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spying technologies that jeopardize all of us.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "it is important to us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snowden have a possibility to show misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower," ""</seg>
<seg id="39">Or the next environmental worker who will alert us to the infested waters of Flint. or a Wall Street insider that warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to commit crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[the "Panama Papers" revealed that rich and mighty] [vast sums of money have hidden in tax havens].] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] This week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents from the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers come to firms like Mossack Fonseca and say:" "" "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has mailboxes in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is said that a track of $2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close friend of children's days, a famous cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who wait nervously for the next release, and on the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agent writer or John-Grisham's novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to weep away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should that happen to us?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: when the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this applies to all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organisation, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In the whole world, media and leading politicians, how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and disguise their assets - something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem to be very confusing this whole world and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matryoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what it is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there have been no prominent Americans in these exposures to this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it's not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortunes in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But due to the principle that these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, in some US states less information is needed to give less information in order to form a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed cheaters to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here with Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked us that all except one of our investigators made suggestions on how to transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody was given money to anybody. however, it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">"" "" "" "it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our covert investigator." ""</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single leader politician, wrapped up in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works through corruption, tax avoidance, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And in order to do so, we have to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">It may sound very cloudy as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing had ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist I see that things have started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the past few years, we have seen more transparency as regards the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The issue met political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has grasped in central registers on a national level, who really is behind firms in Europe and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the uncomfortable facts is that the US lagged behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties submitted a draft bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how this Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the United States and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us with Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bogus companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need executives in the economy to stand up and say:" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and are committed to ending this kind of transparency by law." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "together, we can finally end the intransparency which now allows this kind of tax avoidance, corruption and money laundering." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story I almost abducted and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after finishing my design studies, I made an end-to-day sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my clothes.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me enthusiastically how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where are you sleeping tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "and I thought," "" "Oh, man!" ""</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "what do I do now?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard say," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "uh, as please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was lying in bed, I stared at the blanket and thought, "Oh man! what did I rock in there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he's mad? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I got out of bed, embarrassed at the toes to the door, and shut my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he wasn't crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he bought from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it changed my perspective completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">Having people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress with me.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let us take a time leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "" "" "I am unemployed, almost broke, my roommate drags off and the rent is increased." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can make it turn fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could make something to it. our apartment became a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, plus a mattress and each morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded such "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese-ham omelettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them throughout the city. when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I stared at us.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that at the same time we could find new friends and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if we could make a business concept from it.</seg>
<seg id="138">This is how we presented the investors: "we want to create a website where people post images from their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors are closed when a visit is over.</seg>
<seg id="139">Via the Internet, they can then invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile to fire.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they did not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still very consoled would invest in a shop that allows foreigners to sleep in homes of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that foreigners are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you are contemplating the things that you can do well. we were able to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Arts we had learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taste of what degree of trust we aspire.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone in your hands.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I'd like you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Put your unlocked mobile phone to your left roommate.</seg>
<seg id="157">This soft touch of panic that you feel now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is even more personal than your mobile is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, kitchen, toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked cell phone of a stranger in his hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most people feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So even most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just like that, who actually has Al Gores mobile?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please declare on Twitter that he is candidaced for the office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the cell phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a small detail of this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had just presented himself with his name; if he had told where he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 convictions, all say: "he can hold out really well-locked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile?</seg>
<seg id="172">A well thought-out feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to give negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both host and guest had given up their convictions before placing them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how similar they are in terms of age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Not surprisingly, we trust people most that are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It becomes exciting to add a person's call -- in our case through assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three convictions, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation admits commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you value from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you tell too little, like" "" "Hi!" "", "you don't get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "one tells too much, for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother" "" "-- -- the request is not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimum degree of openness, such as "Great works of art in your home! I'm going on holiday with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text box to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices towards strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take advantage of our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First of all: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Thirdly, a demand that had not been met beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us, the business is going very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when everything is not running smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who did not allow parties to celebrate parties or homes devastated.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I was at the front line when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that we hear in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For men are familiar with one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, wonderful things can occur.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests spent holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels that save lives even though they don't know one at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books past.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, not every stay does not expire.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind pure money transaction are exactly what one wants to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled across this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is an economic trade here.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but to call it simply" "" "rental industry" "" "is not just the case." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People put a part of themselves open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">If you travel these days, you can compare it with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at any place you visited, a group of residents would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one at a pub drive neighborhood of which you have never heard of it;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, flats are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from the ground to the other?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of shared participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that enable us to society and relationships instead of loneliness and isolationism.</seg>
<seg id="239">This project has already started in South Korea's capital Seoul. many parking spaces that belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered to residents. students who were looking for a place to stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were mediated to people whose children had moved out. incubator programs were launched,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone 785,000 people in 191 countries will be guests in 191 countries.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as it was taught us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There was also hospitality in advance.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find this amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Downright overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda drives past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this big influence, I wonder what we can use for design in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, brainwashing, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>

<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim, it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>

<seg id="277">"" "my feminist friends were horrified:" "" "why do you oppress yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, questioned, doubted, and finally believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was trust and slow dedication, deepening with every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Have you ever felt that someone perceives you, you fully understand, and yet somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">That's how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I got married and started, like all good Egyptians, my career as an engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">Later, after my marriage, I had a child, and basically lived the "Egyptian-American Dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that horrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word "breaking news."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, airplanes flew in buildings, people jumped out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical error?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into outrage.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should one do such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="299">I switched to the television channel and heard: "Muslim terrorists..."... in the name of Islam... "..." Middle Eastern origin... ",..." Jihad... "..." bombed Mecca! "</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It has not only been attacked by my country, but in the Nu the deeds of others turned into a suspect.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day, we had to drive through the Midwest of the USA to move to a new city and start the postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember how I felt -- when we were silent -- as deep as it went to my seat, and I was the first time I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We went to our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said, "Be vigilant," "Be careful," "Stay in well lit areas," "Do not be sampled."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed inside the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday the same week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"" "and again the warnings:" "" "do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="309">I looked at the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard about attacks on Muslims or people who were held for Muslims, dragging and beating free.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something didn't feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this land have attacked our land.</seg>
<seg id="315">"" "" "" "I have repudiated the anger of the people to the terrorists." ""</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was angry too.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain oneself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing to ask, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">These are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"" "today, we can actually hear people say," "" "There is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims." ""</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and include mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It only raises the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumour is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are futile because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Like all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumour in the body of the US, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympic gods.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">Maybe a few parking spaces will be released, but don't stop terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to a more tolerant view of people of other faiths and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington D.C. area recently told me: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">During the radicalization process, one has noticed that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their congregation, even from their family, so that the extremistress group can make a brainwashing that leads to the terrorists who are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or rejected by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop people from going to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS bases its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">When Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imaginations if one recognises them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku Klux Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology based on their "holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but if you look at them, they don't do what they read in their" "" "Holy Scripture" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she had planned to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. every minister with whom she spoke brought them to silence and told her that their anger, their sense of injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that had made sense to their fury, it was a main goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised her a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This imam recreated the connection with God and their church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them of their anger, he showed their constructive approach to real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, she kept trying to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect each other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour use of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian government system, conformity, and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: when people submit messages that have been reported to be negative about Muslims, they are more likely to receive military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">When you look at when the sentiment goes up against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two periods of elections.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can indeed be a tool for the manipulation of the public to hollow out the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first but the toxic air of fear harms us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">When assigning collective guilt it is not only about having to explain oneself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deh was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the Faculty of Dentistry, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was amazed and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when has my brother become such an accomplished young man?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting in the afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="376">He fired eight times on Deaah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism may not only be immoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or did we stay safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about what America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us by fear, or one in which we can freely exert our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the child's seat, we routed silently, with high pressure at the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, drew my shoes, went into the hall of prayer, and what I saw let me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the assemblies were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had preferred courage and compassion for panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Are you going to be safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who mean: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what do you say to those who might say that you are holding a TEDTalk, a mentor with draught, working in a noble think tank, so an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't be fooled. I am totally normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">When one looks at the Muslims around the world, and I did the largest ever study on Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am in no way an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people like an exception appear to rule, then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for bastards is about to become a billionary business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air parcel service penetrated into our social awareness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the Frac Centre in France built a six-metre high tower of 1 500 bricks in front of the audience.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting, air units achieve high speed and acceleration in the tightest of spaces.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-winding structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to bear loads, deal with turbulence and generally react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to transcend the limits of possibility in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to function autonomously, it is necessary to know collectively, where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine the calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands are available at the highest level e. g. "start" and "land."</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called stern starters,</seg>
<seg id="422">An aircraft that tries to hit two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other runners, it is efficient in advance flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starter-runners, it can hover, and thus has great advantages in start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence like wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind this is that the aircraft no matter what location the optimal position is regained and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions which penetrate to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled aircraft that had only two moving parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying worked with just one.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monospinner, the mechanically most simple remote-operated flight device. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and cross-rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it's simple, inside the interior, a lot happens so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear-starters. to bring it to flying, I have to throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood of throwing it right when I watch it is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the Monospinner is an exercise in pleasantness, this machine is here, the coach with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this outflow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, it receives the extraordinary ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Move in the room in all directions, no matter what direction it is turned, or even as it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some are imaginable in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at it.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate two propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you assemble them, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, if something goes wrong -- an engine or propeller goes off, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further, albeit restrained.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by rendering one half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examined synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial micro-quadcopter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in the room it is and is self-governed. that's why there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, these demonstrations will motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The especially safe machine on the back wants to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For guys like us, wages are in development and creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that it allows creative, smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular fashion.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, two black holes revolved around each other in a very far away galaxy; they converted the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this brief moment, they brightened more brightly than all the stars along with all galaxies of the whole universe known.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big boy.</seg>
<seg id="472">Their energy, however, did not set them free in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was handed over into space-time-structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events in a timely manner.</seg>
<seg id="476">"" "" "" "more than 1.3 billion years ago, a number of celot lives were created on Earth." ""</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has produced some things: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God is at us -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group decided particularly brave -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which are formed by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them considered them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized it as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, construction, conception and extremely hard work, they built the detector Ligo: the laser interferometer gravitational-waves-observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following period, the precision of Ligo could be considerably increased, which greatly improved the recognition capacity.</seg>
<seg id="483">That is why it is now called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">In the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was started for a final test run in order to clarify some minor, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, just a few days after the start of the detector, the gravitational waves roamed through the earth through the two colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically these were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: that's my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves of black holes for 23 years and her through observatories as ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational-waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A wave of gravity is a ripple in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When moving the shaft, the space and its contents are stretched in one direction and into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustrative purposes, lecturers often perform a really alpine dance in courses on the theory of relativity.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and stow, stretch and stow."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and squeezed at the meeting of the waves. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This means 20 zeros after comma, followed by a 1. that's why the Ligo employees declared it crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five kilometre long laser detector, and that's already absurd, that length should be measured on less than one thousandth of the radius of a nucleus. that's grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows:" "" "the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne released this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to say that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because so you can create an image or a map of things by perceiving the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">Sounds are different in tones.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually, impossible to produce a picture of things that can mean you a lot:</seg>
<seg id="512">Your child's face approximately.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume in order to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now is Alice talking." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"" "" "" "and Bob is breaking them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummer Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">With them we cannot make simple images of objects in space.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies lie in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe speak.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravity to listen can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with what my colleague Scott has been working for quite a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, just wrap: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two bodies fast, you hear the same panty with an additional key change. you can get the wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [Surrendes noise] No one who knows what to listen to, recognizes this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold solar mass, which rotate approximately as quickly as the bars of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's briefly consider what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolves one hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">In this there is the permanent meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a completely new way to researching the universe as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this road we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">We can't see much in space -- practically or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereic stars explode in super-novas.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes happen in the nucleus that lies hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through as these are opak.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate the iron, as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them, because the Big Bang is covered by its own afterglow.</seg>
<seg id="541">With gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And probably the most important thing: I am optimistic that there exist in all things that we have never seen, which we will never see and of which we have no idea at all. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact Ligo found things right in the first attempt, which we had not expected.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, such as Ligo watches, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are, so to speak, the sour bones for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo gives us a completely different perspective on the happenings in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately how we came out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circling of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried out an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for a year I would say" "" "Yes!" "" "I was afraid of." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">"" "no matter if it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say" "" "Yes" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be on TV live?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what I was afraid of, my fear brushed away.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear of talking speeches, my social anxiety -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes," "" "changed my life." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"" "" "" "yes," "" "changed me." ""</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a definite yes that deeply changed my life, on an unexpected kind. it began with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three unbelievable daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, names all the" "" "kittens" "", "for inexplicable reasons." ""</seg>

<seg id="571">"" "" "" "kitten, I need milk for my umbilical cup." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">From then on, I swear to play with them whenever you ask me. no matter what I'm doing or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I am not perfect, but I am very tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magic effect on me, my children, our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">"" "but it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I fully understood that the" "" "yes" "" "to play with my children saved my career." ""</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am a writer. I am thinking of things, awaken you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">A dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">A dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I created television. I produced television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I am making television, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for bringing 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four television programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows simultaneously are in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment provides hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode, every nine days, four shows, four television programs, 70 hours of television, four television programs, 70 hours of TV, three programmes simultaneously in production, at the same time four, 16 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series are run one after the other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series in 256 regions run in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts I have created myself and not only produced, so still on top. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around camp fire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire that are burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is doing that?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">A dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with that.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you that all of you who work so hard, whether you run a company, a country or a classroom, a business or a budget, take me seriously when I talk about work, so that you understand that I'm not just playing around on the computer and fantasies, and it's true when I say: I understand that it's not about dreams in a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It is all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I'm engrossed in the work, there's no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a land out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as if I set up troops as if I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As soon as you see a high sound, deliver a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible. and the best thing about it is the sum.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz listens like a busy street, I could drive on it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people accept when I explain to them the sums that I talk about writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't get me wrong, that's what she does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sum -- when I began to work and work with the TV production, when I began to work and work, to create, create and work together, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy. the totals!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sum is action and activity. the sum is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The hum is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz, then you won't be able to do anything other than your size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being able to do otherwise than to strive for size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sum.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it's a genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it's the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I just know that I'm not made for failure, and I just know that I love the totals.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">In order to make it clear: the more I become, the more broadcasts, the more episodes, the more work there are, the more things the more I write, the more I write history, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high sound, the sum, the sum, the sum.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzz. I love the hum.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzzing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overloaded, exaggerated, burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sum was halted.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mom is a single working title.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mum won't be there, but you can write my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says:" "" "kitten, I want to go to Shonda-Land." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1, when the buzzing ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzzing of the engine was silent.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my work anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sum did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as always: the same Titanic work, 15 hours-days, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing to delegate, a Titan sleeps not, does not give up, with whole heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no hum.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sum and the sum I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you are doing, the work that you love suddenly fade away?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think," "" "Look, stupid author-titanium." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do it, you do it, you love what you are doing, you love being a teacher, a banker, a mother, one loves to be a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives you the buzz if you know the totals when the hum stops, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern state waitress" "" "asks me a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I'm on the way out, late and she says," "" "Mom, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no, when two things become clear to me:</seg>
<seg id="674">"" "first, I have to say yes to everything and second, she did not call me" "" "kitten." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "she does not call anybody" "" "kitten." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">"" "" "" "I hate it when I am Titan and rob my buzz, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes." ""</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mom, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about this.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding, because my pain and my panic, in the loneliness and the lack of the sum, I can do nothing except fitting out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high tone - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it's all about letting go, or whatever the girl is releasing in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something inside me solves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door enters and an energy shift comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that does not immediately, but it happens it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sum is slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sum, but a sum.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I know a magic secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sum, the sums of work, the titanium dioxide, that's just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself by means of broadcasts and television hours and how functioning my brain is, then I forgot what the real sum is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sum is not a force and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sum is the stream that comes from the zest of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real buzz is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sum ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words to me, because what God told me I am a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="715">It's just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a permanent rule, so that I can free myself from any blame as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the sum again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">I don't like to play in such a way as to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what kind of person is better to be than home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, yes, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">"" "honestly, I call myself" "" "Titan" "" "--" ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is not one of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We fly around in the garden, before and forth, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We do small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel overwhelmingly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always take my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the sum of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why did we ever stop playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also do it! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you think me is naïve, for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You are right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And you know why? you're not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybird or biscuit will replace me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And talking to my teenage daughter for 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It is only 15 minutes, more need not.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can spend 15 minutes on the track, even on a bad day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no linen, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are getting ready.</seg>
<seg id="756">But there are 15 minutes in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my well-being, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is important to feel the hum, to have a place for his peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "around the" "" "play" "" "in general." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it out.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I fail and I win. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" is just about anything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training when I wanted to surpass myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a bit, why not allow yourself in 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzz came back in my spare time. the buzz seems to return if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the hum, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the sum, the sum is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sum.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sum of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sum of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sum of the work is part of me, but just a part of it. and I am so grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">It's snowing to me that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, who plays a trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and to more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still working. my campfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the clearer is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the land I create, the marathon, which I run, the troops, the canvases, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the other, the right sums: the sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this buzz, the more this unusual, consistent, bare and new feeling of being alive within me spreads.</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel this sum, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am a writer. I am thinking of things, I stir you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">That is part of the job, which means living his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a bit dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"" "I said" "" "Yes" "" "to less work and to more games." ""</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have every day to do with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another after a heavy stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low capacity for self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became a functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor trying to improve the nerve functions by means of various surgical techniques.</seg>
<seg id="804">They have heard of one of the best known, "deep brain stimulation." in doing so, an electrode is implanted deep in the brain to influence the neurons circuitry in such a way that the neurological function is improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease, which suffered from violent tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation however does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">History started 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was a senior physician and worked night and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I supplied patients with skull-brain traumas.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that the brain swells and increases the cranial pressure in skull-brain traumas.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save life, it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="816">For this you sometimes have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Being able to grow cells from a piece of tissue is comparable to very small children who are taken out of their families.</seg>
<seg id="822">Proper nutrition, temperature, humidity and environments must be found in order to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts it was Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are immature cells that can turn into any cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operating room.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they divide themselves very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They parted slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the fetus stage, they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain because we find it in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">This is not so certain.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing, however, is clear -- we received our stem cells from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non-language area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did by Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then color them in color to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we re-imported it at the point of view of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we have re-reimplantation these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we have re-reimplantated the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we imported the cells into a healthy brain and we observed that after a few weeks they completely disappeared as if they had been removed again, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury and re-imported exactly the same cells and now the cells remained - they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells which have been re-imported.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells that we color in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we couldn't stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained apes with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable level of skill, we injured the motor skills area in the motor cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">As a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in humans, they recovered spontaneously to some degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover at some degree, just like the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached his level of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side they see the monkey, who recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance prior to the injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Look now, when we re-heralded the re-reimplantations: the same monkey, two months after the plantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant it in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">"" "Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" "" "I know someone who can do that." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results, you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">It depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authorities allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, it is necessary to apply this to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You first have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a great mistake to consider it a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at it as an immutable fact.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved doubtlessly that it is quite possible to have a flourishing capitalism and an impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">Democracy is in fact vanishing with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistakably made clear to me as finance minister in the Euro Group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my adorable friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Euro Group are mistaken, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defenant democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy our societies are murderers, our future gloomy and our great new technologies wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the topic of waste, I would like to point out to you an interesting contradiction which currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin summit paradox" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt, which casts its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the wealthy depositors and corporations, but they are too scared to invest there where it would be productive and income, with which one could pay the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, such as "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past three months, US, England and the eurozone have spent 3.8 billion US dollars, in all the wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, railway tracks, equipment and so on and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 billion US dollars will sound after a lot of money, until you compare it with the $5.1 billion that were at the same time lying around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did absolutely nothing to inflate the stock markets and put up real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debts and unproductive capital form the twin peaks that are not offset by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low total economic demand, which, as in an endless loop, enhances the pessimism of the investors, in which they do not invest.</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally bring about the circumstances that cause the body to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hair with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His exceedingly lavish art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to further develop human talents and to finance particularly all the technologies, "green" technologies which are decisive for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue, what do we mean under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">Of course, the Athenian democracy included too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Athenian democracy on the basis of these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive factor in the Athenian democracy was and is that it involved the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which they granted them the right to political co-determination with equal weight weighting in matters of state concerns.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian Democracy did not last long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that shines brightly, it is quickly burned out.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, today's liberal democracies have not roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- that is, the world of the corporations -- became a democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In today's democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and the economy began, a relentless struggle between the two takes place, by gradually substituting the policy and escaping it.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why the politicians are no longer as they were before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not on a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because nowadays it is possible to be in the government and still not in power because the power of politics has migrated to the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it's like a herd of predators that have so sustainably decimated the animals from which it feeds, that they end up starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is with the economy that has cannibalized politics so far that it harms itself by the self-created economic crisis itself. the power of corporations grows, political goods are depreciated, the inequality rises, the macroeconomic demand falls, and the managing directors of the corporations are frightened to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism markets the "demos" of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the wasting of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we have to bring the politics and the economy back together, and it would be better if the "demos" keeps control, as in ancient Athens, except for the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it didn't look very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the laboring poor regain a position just as in ancient Athens without creating new forms of brutality and extravagance.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers with automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation lets the twin peaks become higher, the waste more sublime, and the social conflicts deeper, just as I believe -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we must reshape the economy and reunite the spheres of economics and politics, and make sure that we democratise the reunified area, otherwise we end up in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy, which makes the film "Matrix" like a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question therefore is not whether capitalism will survive the technical conquests that it has brought forth --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that in "matrix," or by something that resembles the society in "Star Trek," in which machines are used in the exploration of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athens "Agora," in long conversations the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like to have this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "matrix" -similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the company: please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while working and where your capital follows you from one job to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one currently works -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income comes from capital and from redemption and the concept of wage labour is completely overtaken.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those belonging to companies, but they do not work in it, and employees who work there, but which the company does not belong to. no more exchange between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no towering twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the sphere of global political economy, please briefly point out that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "cosmos" -- and each government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a mutual fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">"" "imagine that this fund is investing in" "" "green" "" "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare." ""</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed at the Bretton Woods Conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time one did not have the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"" "" "" "today, we have them, especially against the background of a reunified politics and economy." ""</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe to you is at the same time the secretary in which she prefers privileged people, and Marxian because it will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the dustbin of history, and Keynesian, globally Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else, it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or are we going to sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide politically together.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">In your biography you describe yourself as a liberal Marxist.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and the economy is... Do we not do this, technological development will produce such a massive drop in macroeconomic demand, which Larry Summers referred to as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from one part of the earth to the next as we are currently experiencing it will destabilize not only our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, then Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, that's why I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and so I am totally mad.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you are not confused, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said that. BG: in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner by the orators you have said very clearly what you think of the West's view in China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my speech, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it is playing -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a sense, when I may say so provocative, China is similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- that is a mistake, historically regarded.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was especially sceptical about democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What one can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">To blame China now to do what the West has done itself in the 19th century smells immensely after hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I sensed that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later to the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely saying goodbye to the complacency and the permanent denial that a massive fault line went through the Eurozone and continues to threaten the development of the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which, by the way, was the first suggestion that revealed this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the Euro Group, have also chosen the denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the Soviet Union's experience --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to keep an economic system that is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism, you might be able to delay it for a while, but when the change occurs it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you anticipate?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes during your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Ernst...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a minister of finance, or any minister who, after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, claims he has made no mistake, then it is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for extending the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the side of the lenders to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They just wanted to bring our government down, just because they didn't want to deal with the distortions running through the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that they had been carrying out a catastrophic programme in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">"" "worse than during the" "" "Great Depression" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "none of the troika's troika, who imposed this policy on us, admitted," "" "That was a colossal mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive sound of talks, you seem to be still pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is from someone who lives and loves Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if it does not survive, the released centrifugal forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">"" "" "" "this will not have disastrous consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire global economy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we allow ourselves to take the path of a post-modern 1930, after which it appears to me, it will also be detrimental to the future of Europeans and non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope you're wrong at this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you for being at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Of Roy Price, most of them have never heard before, although he is likely to be responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy did three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The Amazon TV production company.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has a hedgehog and describes himself on Twitter as" "" "Films, TV, Technics, Tacos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard-fought branch.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy can't select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are on the right side of this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This graph is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows will receive this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued with nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"" "these are shows like" "" "Breaking Bad" "", "" "" "Game of Thrones," "" "" The Wire "" "." your brain asks: "" "" where are there more of these episodes? "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "on the left, here at this end, shows like" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "" "-- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve." ""</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not worry about getting on the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to sign "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He gets more thoughts about the middle training, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he has to make sure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes such a thing, so Roy Price does not want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows by evaluating eight candidates, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online where they can watch them for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon gives out for free, you don't have to use it properly?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You can record when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you skip or look again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process them and get the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a sitcom over four Republican US senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House hits 7.5 -- so something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix. just like Roy, he is always on the lookout to find this super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a bit different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of organizing a competition, he and his team looked at the available data on the Netflix Viewer, so the reviews they give the shows, the course of which shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the spectators: what shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has hit a hit with it, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this turn. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data-sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this about?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data, for a decision you meet, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You optimize it through very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">What you can expect is good television, right?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work, then this is somewhat frightening, because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond TV.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software. come in touch, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in prison here in the U.S. and asks for discharge, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge takes place or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always producing the best results. it's not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the most experienced companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that due to data analysis, it could predict outbreaks of flu, a bad way -- by analysing Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully well and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the journal Nature.</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked flawlessly, year around year, until it suddenly stopped working,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply didn't work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the journal Nature.</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the most experienced firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data inflows into decisions of life -- at work, in law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very wise people use unimaginably many data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">Do you ever have to solve a complex problem, mainly two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, you dismantle this problem into its components so that you can analyse the items; as a second, put the items together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help disassemble a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all own it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces to be put together again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to get a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and mind, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what they wouldn't have been able to do otherwise. but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show such as "House of Cards" was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first when they were competing for TV ideas when they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "that's the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data is just a tool, and in order not to forget this, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, it was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It's also called Magic 8 Ball. it's amazing. for decisions using a Jaw or No question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will try it later with a technical demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="1132">I've made some decisions in my life so far, I should have heard in hindsight on the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, if you have the data available, you want to replace them with a bit more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not alter the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball will be smarter and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it's up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this very encouraging news that despite the huge amount of data, it still pays off to make decisions, to be an expert in what you are doing and taking risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
