Munich , 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Irish institution , where young people are to meet today .
a cryp@@ t chapel , where it is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers cultivate the former soil of peasants .
the oldest official map of Munich encourages exciting stories .
it anno@@ ys when maps are not up to date .
everybody knows this , which had to be very exciting , because the car navigation system , instead of a b@@ ypass road , showed a green meadow .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Bavarian State Government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but that &apos;s why it is very revealing .
especially when comparing them with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how towns and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Mer@@ cury since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a fli@@ ck@@ ering carpet that is not recognized as such .
detailed maps , so @-@ called ur@@ gency sheets , were incorporated into the large map of the map for towns and villages .
these were based on data from the Bavarian surv@@ ey@@ or between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria for military purposes .
even if the French troops were finally deduc@@ ted from Lun@@ é@@ ville &apos;s peace of 9 February 18@@ 01 : it was the present @-@ day neighbours who created the idea of an area @-@ wide Bayern District .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph drove the project forward , set up the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographical Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and there@@ with the Bavarian surv@@ ey@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the position sheet for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like all others on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison between former and present is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the map , i.e. 18@@ 77 , as a Munich subur@@ b .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was first named after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming in a smaller map appears with dozens of lines and numbers : hand @-@ written numbered fl@@ utes from the so @-@ called &quot; original recording &quot; from which the base tax was derived .
small par@@ c@@ els now no longer occupy farmers , but small farmers in the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 the location of the Oktober@@ fest , was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert in the 19th century .
on the other hand of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the area of the present district of Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; at the Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; or the height &quot; lying on the air &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions .
in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich district @-@ asylum &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; was born there in 18@@ 58 / 59 .
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed the institution - the psychiat@@ rist who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and , for example , ended the chain of so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he prohibited the staff from using violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients , first place had been , and later it was extended to 500 seats .
at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the &quot; Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; in hair 1905 .
since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , has been there since 2006 .
young people in Munich &apos;s Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um meet at the site of the former au@@ ric institution .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with educational establishments .
to the west lies the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential houses from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was built - in architectural reference to the original building of the asylum , which was destroyed during the Second World War with bomb attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ inger street was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the Al@@ lied bombs broke many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a big one remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t chapel from the Middle Ages were once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days the prepar@@ atory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line @-@ trip takes place .
with the sli@@ der , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
citizen &apos;s Rights group publishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of Far@@ es issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks of the State .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls for Af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to pay special attention when travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , racial @-@ based incidents occur recently throughout the state and can be noted here , &quot; said the Group &apos;s opinion .
a recently adopted Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which makes it more difficult for people to capture discrimination complaints , as well as the state &apos;s law enforcement agencies that dispro@@ portion@@ ately focus on minorities , prompted the group to issue warnings , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are hal@@ ted or killed because of their skin color , &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the US .
the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist crime against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more fuel during the trip through the state and was taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of crime .
the Council also points out a recent report by the Mis@@ sour@@ i General Secretary @-@ General Bureau , which shows that black mot@@ orists in the state are being stopped 75 percent more frequently than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be ready to bring any deposit money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the newest facts from the Hass@@ an Crime Reports program of the FB@@ I , which classi@@ fy the state with regard to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country .
the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which would make it more difficult to su@@ e a company because of housing or employment discrimination .
prior to that , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States had passed immigration laws to arrest the local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations , which will contribute to further race benefits according to the AC@@ L@@ U .
travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but recently interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
electric fence project is elementary
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fisch@@ bacher Wei@@ de@@ wit@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project is a successful project and will continue next year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U members of the Bundestag , Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac , presented an image on the spot .
representatives of the CD@@ U @-@ village association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ u@@ ties at the leg@@ land court of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann granted insight into his company , in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many k@@ itt@@ ens are provided and accommodated in five apartments .
for him , &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milch , &quot; for him , is the alternative market@@ able way for the milk of his cows , &quot; says Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
on the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively regional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as he is also B@@ L@@ H@@ V Chairman of Fis@@ her@@ bach , he called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turn@@ key project &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot generate profit@@ ably on such steep surfaces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the green area care for a lot of work , much must be processed with the brush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental farm and managed it without chemical pesticides and fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers , even if he did not conduct bio @-@ operation .
for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commune has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader funding . &quot;
at a cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported .
it is hoped that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the land could be dra@@ gged out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how to keep their business going , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of subsidies , farmers often stand in criticism
in 2013 , a total of 25 par@@ c@@ els were fenced by eleven participants .
the area of disclosure is 40 hectares , which must not be aff@@ or@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total costs of 71 500 euros , half of the leaders were promoted , a quarter was part of the municipality of Fis@@ her@@ bach .
thus the farmers remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of pasture fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great advantage is the long service life of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job without farmers and farmers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Peter White also stated : &quot; the best foods are produced here . &quot;
the Land@@ scape Conservation Gui@@ deline ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state @-@ run promotion of pasture f@@ ences .
the aim is to keep the Black Forest open .
the pre@@ condition is the presence of a conveying backdrop referred to by the L@@ PR .
moreover , the fen@@ cing area must not be min@@ pper@@ able ( incl@@ ination above 35 per cent ) and must therefore be threatened by aff@@ or@@ estation .
for the 2018 f@@ isher @-@ starter project the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build a fence of just under 16 kilometres , is currently underway .
the disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euro .
is nothing sacred anymore ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the President &apos;s proposals for dr@@ astic restrictions on legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to be fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and liberty im@@ person@@ ators would have liked him if he had done so .
but he gra@@ b@@ bed its significance , and in particular the importance that it was attributed to , as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta insi@@ sted : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world .
the poem you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is properly correct , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , and your afflicted people who desire to breathe freely , and the poor fall of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mis@@ erable waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our screens was better to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller was not involved in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate : it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words on the base after their death - knew very well that they took up a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out , classical depic@@ tion .
Lazarus has changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and exactly as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people from right wing wanted to change this for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone but rather an early neo @-@ conserv@@ atism that brings the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward .
it is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch is not supposed to illumin@@ ate the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather unusual , Lim@@ bau@@ gh came across something .
the significance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative action of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhau@@ sting , mis@@ erable but hop@@ eful people after long and often horri@@ fic trips on the deck of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue tells them the words of hope and the welcome they must hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever like to acknowledge .
their torch shall not light the way , but ign@@ ite the hatred that is their only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Scot@@ s@@ men belonged to the British team .
the performance director of the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship leader will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which will start on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland something special develops &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics has to learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chers , who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m stretch , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team captain .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest .
their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought in were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver medal winner , who will compete in the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les at their fifth World Championships , says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Scot@@ s@@ men are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best overall number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir leads along this road and last year set five British and two European records .
she will participate in the 1.500 m and the 5.000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man to watch for a great season with the British Team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world cup as the only other Scot@@ s@@ man was in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell .
the team captain states that they are &quot; enormously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases they will also be involved in med@@ als and fin@@ als .
&quot; the special thing about team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a big honor anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ate had voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots who belong to the team .
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb on po@@ di@@ ums .
as for my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world cup .
so it is really important to get this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blocking of Cri@@ tics on Facebook : do not worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the pre@@ heating of voters
the father of our country knew something bad .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the papers struck him for everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he kno@@ cked at the cri@@ tique , sure .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because in 17@@ 83 Washington said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gan &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and that &apos;s why the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union su@@ ed him at the beginning of this week .
the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is a Republi@@ can Gover@@ nor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary ho@@ ax head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict observ@@ ance of the principles .
he was also very clever to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to play his hair@@ less head for chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of people coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum called official and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans spokes@@ woman Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too simple to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people sw@@ inging online the whi@@ p .
the post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are only true people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a pastor , no troll@@ s .
they all said their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful , and not prof@@ ane .
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic faith .
attorney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not filled with water but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was pol@@ ite that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I also don &apos;t appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same subject , then they are dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the governor &apos;s staff referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call others &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is much cleaner than in previous times when one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical newspaper articles or to arrest and silence prot@@ esters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that &apos;s exactly what is happening digitally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public servant to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is accused of Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this issue was last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County has injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when she ban@@ ished a vot@@ er from her Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) received a visit to the AC@@ L@@ U due to his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of the affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters pun@@ ctu@@ ated his leadership .
and even then Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions that critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trading and shipping with Britain overwhel@@ med his ministry , according to the historical documents collected by the online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project .
but he did not silence her .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreements and dis@@ courses constitute the foundation of our nation .
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year at the Arch@@ er@@ field Links to the final round , before losing against Paul E@@ ales , is associated with the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the association founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he found this place .
he is a keen advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , even though he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels very special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I had won it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour this year after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to the action on home ground .
this event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a little more when you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again , and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am happy about the outcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer through passive smoking
in the past two decades fewer people have died due to passive smoking in lung cancer .
this results in a study by scientists of the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer deaths per year are due to passive smoking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Professor Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject since 1994 .
back then there were 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; the construction works in Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are somewhat in time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the agriturismo Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is much se@@ amounts in the underground , which is not noted in the plans .
traffic , which again and again obstruc@@ ts construction work , is a big problem for St@@ ump@@ p &apos;s construction company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of mot@@ orists on red lights and barriers is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road was closed and only the regular buses were allowed to pass through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ est@@ z and Tim Ko@@ est@@ z of St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;

poverty and death in the Indones@@ ian gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she does not use a stove .
she even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the pan@@ i@@ ai reg@@ ent@@ ance in the un@@ quiet Indones@@ ian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually lays a sweet potato - locally known as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the char@@ red tu@@ ber is removed with eager , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the lo@@ am floor - she doesn &apos;t have any furniture - where she also performs her daily work , such as washing clothes with d@@ ull water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a shel@@ tered space serves as lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of her husband &apos;s four wives , her fields were not assigned .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course it can be dangerous to work late : most of the village men are unemployed , and many drink hard , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; no one dar@@ es to run around in the village after 5@@ pm , &quot; she says .
it is a rare glimpse into daily life in the High@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occup@@ ying troops .
an existing movement that led to independence from the Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jak@@ arta government , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers .
in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea that included the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is bar@@ ren . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with a rental car .
there is no public transport .
the town with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and made of corrugated iron roofs , which were converted into different yel@@ low@@ ish tones by rust .
only very few In@@ don@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not accustomed to wear these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ ge@@ i says , and points to her bright , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright skirt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we used to have only leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst inf@@ ant mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable Gold@@ mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port reduced the value of USD 3.1 billion in gold and copper .
in addition , Papua has wood resources valued at an estimated $ 78 billion .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for Papua , ensuring that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military maintains a sti@@ fled presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid almost $ 20 million between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to one single officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pap@@ u@@ lian demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped , tor@@ tured and imprisoned by the Indones@@ ian military since 1969 .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal land in the 1970 &quot; s were geno@@ ci@@ dal according to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indones@@ ian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Will Find Out &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means in a report published by the Bris@@ ban@@ e Arch@@ dioc@@ ese from 2016 , which reports about atro@@ cities of the previous year , such as un@@ lawful kill@@ ings and torture - rape and electrical charges are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week events happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have increased since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing because Muslim economic migrants are coming from the populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ung @-@ cant@@ ines sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served .
local people are struggling to keep up here .
&quot; the migrants have started to sell chi@@ ckens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai Local who moved to the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has cost the native Papua , the mo@@ m @-@ Mama &#91; die Frauen &#93; from Papua ( her market ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indones@@ ian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the vern@@ ac@@ ular and known as the Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address the ine@@ qualities and violations of law in Papua during his campaign in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai , on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but little has changed in Papua , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we agreed to Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a freezing point only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inauguration in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was out and sang Christmas car@@ ols off a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indones@@ ian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they were supposed to switch on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers offen@@ ded their tone and later returned with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their rif@@ les , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was struck so badly that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission set fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Papua @-@ men , women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Centre to demand justice .
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting bu@@ cks and introduced the Wa@@ ita dance - continuously and a bird song in the circle - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started to sling stones on police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , a command was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it says in an official document of TI@@ ME that was not released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the im@@ pending danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
no one was in the mood to listen .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left wrist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the ver@@ and@@ ah of his colorful painted wooden house .
Kay@@ ame still does not know who fired , but says that the bul@@ let came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , his c@@ ousin , who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ ane , who only bears a name like many In@@ don@@ esi@@ ans , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood .
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot;
the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told repor@@ ters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ tan@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to the Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings came to Jak@@ arta on the following day .
three weeks ago , Jok@@ ow@@ i in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura held a passionate account in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved right away so that it won &apos;t happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2016 , Minister of Security , Wi@@ ran@@ to , said that he would set up an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historic human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries occurred a long time ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &quot; s and the beginning of the 2000 &quot; s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations , but there are processes that must be passed through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on June 5 in Jak@@ arta and said he did not have any plans to establish a complaint in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wi@@ ran@@ to , whom the UN accused of &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; demanding more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence referendum of 1999 , said that 11 cases of violations of human rights in Papua were already included , including the pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such asser@@ tions with fi@@ erc@@ ely dis@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress whatsoever , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid of being arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that the people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the corp@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indones@@ ian police shot villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s s@@ iting office .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw rocks on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indones@@ ian param@@ il@@ itary police ) started shooting and killing one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were so panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains TI@@ ME . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called upon the officers to be held ac@@ coun@@ table and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an accident for the Indones@@ ian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the tribal members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua .
many joined the &quot; Free Papua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , which claims to defend the rights of the Republic by attacking spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indones@@ ian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders came from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people have been arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in recent years and arbitr@@ arily det@@ ained under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ content .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of range .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they retain most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a only cost 10,000 Indones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Papua and the new migrants who have arrived in larger numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nab@@ ire airport .
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and aff@@ lu@@ ent migrants .
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to make their own companies competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai tribe Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
in addition , restrictions of reporting on international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although they were given the rare permit for filming .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises made by Jok@@ ow@@ is election campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s in@@ quiet eastern provinces of Papua and Western pap@@ a : visa den@@ ial and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indones@@ ian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six Pacific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sho@@ oting .
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indones@@ ian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ tha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the group &apos;s alleg@@ ations and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence for human rights cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the human right ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , locals broke their silence and urged him , &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that participated in the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the people of Papua are unlikely to vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but it is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ a@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal council .
he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , except that it lives under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is found in poor educational and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ i says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their voice to Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite threats and in@@ timi@@ dations , the families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ shot victims led a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the corp@@ se of a victim was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they know that they may never give justice to them , but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a lowered head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capturing the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers of the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 3@@ 37 @-@ metre high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that is swept through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which is accidentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch@@ el tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and scre@@ aming the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; told an occup@@ ant who named his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Dubai civil defence agencies said that the fire fighting units at 4.@@ 00 o &apos;clock local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) extingu@@ ished the fire and cooled down the building .
the government said they work on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can resur@@ rec@@ t questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of sky@@ scra@@ pers around the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damages came from facing , exterior pan@@ eling for decoration or insulation .
in the UK , the police said that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in the Gren@@ fell Tower in June , where about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : next best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through with his big Davis Cup coup at the General Meeting .
at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single only on two wins was not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City .
the five set classics , which are often very long , but also very cher@@ ished , are thus retained by the traditional competition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of the member states voted for the reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only margin@@ ally missed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will continue to work to improve the application .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not until the vote , after many contradictions , the proposal had already come before the proposal to carry out the final at a neutral place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 2018 onwards , only comparatively minor details will be : the fin@@ alists will have the host right in the first round of the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in the next round .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements for training positions etc. will be facilit@@ ated and the players will have to complete less official media appointments before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring forbidden objects to the aircraft , find a survey
a survey among flying passengers resulted in smu@@ g@@ gling more than 20 percent deliberately or un@@ intentionally prohibited items at the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , which entered the aircraft while they accidentally carried forbidden knives or other objects with blades .
less than 1 per cent claimed to have discovered that they had accidentally travelled with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey carried out at more than 1,000 people , carried out by a jet @-@ charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers rather dis@@ regard the rules .
of those surv@@ eyed admitted that they have know@@ ingly tried to fly with something prohibited by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent of millenni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , were the members of Generation X .
the most common items that were pur@@ pos@@ ely passed by T@@ SA agents were food and fluids .
more than 3 percent said to have know@@ ingly carried objects with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es also confirmed that they had deliberately brought illegal drugs into the aircraft .
the company said it asked travelers throughout the country to find out how many accidentally smu@@ g@@ gled goods by airport security and how many people had pur@@ pos@@ ely done .
it is no surprise that the people who wear the earliest smu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through safety , those who fly the most frequently .
the company , however , points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which liquids they may take with you or how much of it .
it is therefore no surprise that the bulk of the objects conf@@ is@@ cated by the T@@ SA are prohibited liquids .
for a while the people thought T@@ SA could watch books as smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers .
liquids are permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t care : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
electro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k happily shares with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
in doing so , he has so far under@@ min@@ ed that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the ever triumph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time reveal a different , less brilliant figure on the announcement of the latest quarterly balance : the number of cancell@@ ations made with the new mass market model 3 .
in the past few months , Mus@@ k has often hired more than 500@@ ,000 orders for the new car , whose delivery is just starting .
now , Mus@@ k conce@@ des : 6@@ 3,000 had already been withdrawn from the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders .
critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is purely non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the USA 1000 USD and in Great Britain 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation confirmation &quot; completely back .
at the moment 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations cancelled up in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la leader does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not on demand , but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
all models will be together - 500@@ ,000 by 2018 - one million by 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , there are currently 1800 reservations a day .
those who order a model 3 today must expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand new production lines , never tested in practice , without any major interrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if there is too much delay , the uncertainty of reservations may become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in dro@@ ves .
EPA chief P@@ ru@@ itt with@@ drew due to the hes@@ itation of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
one day after being accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Agency , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce emissions of smoke @-@ causing air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of the state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint lod@@ ged against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ als .
it is a deadline which expi@@ red on October 1 for States in order to comply with the 2015 standards for o@@ zone @-@ related o@@ zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay the observ@@ ance of a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interfer@@ ing with local decisions or interfer@@ ing with economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s At@@ tor@@ ney General of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , was a reliable opponent of strict environmental regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly gone over to block or delay the regulation of the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the most recent legal back@@ stop for the P@@ ru@@ denti@@ al regulatory roll@@ back agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ als in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces the willingness of the EPA to co @-@ operate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to comply with deadlines for implementation and then waited for being indic@@ ted by activists and others , and in an agreement to set the date for implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulating judicial proceedings and we take fri@@ dges seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that gives us serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the EPA approved that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; power to delay and all other legally available powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on solid policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive new version of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
the New York General At@@ tor@@ ney Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of States who had su@@ ed EPA in this week , said the group proposed to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g who flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schneider . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this case , New York joined California , Connec@@ ti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , O@@ reg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil O@@ zone is created when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g may cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and can contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year .
representatives of public health and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered on P@@ ru@@ denti@@ al &apos;s surprising course change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d from Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to address environmental pollution and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ our celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius &apos; Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius &apos; church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a seren@@ ade on Sunday 16th July at 4.@@ 30@@ pm .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius system is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the 6th Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and sponsors Tum@@ bling to their request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Walter Martini emphasized : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the Chapel of St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church at Tum@@ lingen and the Vo@@ g@@ tei &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the wording of the document , on the hill of Tum@@ linger , apart from the former parish church , there was also a glorious courtyard to which the church or patron saint was and not vice versa .
there were also people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , it was beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible in the village of Tum@@ lingen today , the &quot; Berg &quot; the third , the man@@ orial population centre of the village .
old maps from the time around 1600 are supporting these historical facts .
the privilege of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval period of the church .
a gentle@@ man who built a church , furnished and occupied with a pastor , remained owner of this church and could also bequ@@ e@@ ath this church .
in this connection , the right to use a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the bigger one of the two was demol@@ ished at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell sounded for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be delivered later during the Second World War in 1942 .
during the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the window pan@@ es were ham@@ mer@@ ed and the bel@@ lows were stolen .
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops were en@@ camp@@ ed near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and the church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Hil@@ arius cemetery was also the final resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche demol@@ ished .
only the church tower was left standing .
during the New Year &apos;s Eve in 18@@ 34 a storm broke through the church tower and half collap@@ sed .
in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demol@@ ished .
only the tower , which is still present today , was preserved as a witness to the 750 years of the history of the church .
today Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em maintain the Hil@@ arius system as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
as organisers , the friends and promot@@ ers invite Tum@@ bl@@ ende on Sunday 16th July , to the sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade to the old cemetery to the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
this is arranged by the com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with word contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
Dr. Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 pm .
admission is from 3 : 30 pm .
to conclude the seren@@ ade , a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organizers present fantastic views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organizers hope to receive many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius system , which is important for tum@@ ors and hearing schwei@@ ler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the friends and pat@@ rons of Tum@@ arc strongly commit themselves to home care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Martini re@@ affir@@ med . &quot; &quot; &quot;
association wants to allow approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see a legal pre@@ condition for the construction and has therefore turned to the coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take back its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is un@@ lawful .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved at all at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette , as at that time in Vier@@ sen only at the city border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal was a wind power concentration zone .
in this concentration zone construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind power utilization for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones are intended to prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saving &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city of Vier@@ sen had decided only a few days before by a change of the land @-@ protection plan a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette - which however had not authorized the district government Düsseldorf because of a mold failure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning law , the granted approval decision is un@@ lawful and therefore also to be withdrawn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break , the City Council again resolved the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is where the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding writings have entered the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them to the occasion to re @-@ examine the matter .
however , they probably do not cause the procedure to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the content of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette to construct four each 200 @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines .
already last year , the company , in which the city Vier@@ sen is indirectly involved , had lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 @-@ hect@@ are site .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ leg@@ ged households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sens City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind farm Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind turbine plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor crash together : woman dies in terrible accident
a terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was seriously injured .
two more persons were slightly injured .
the state road remained closed for hours .
according to police instructions , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch took the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her car as part of the accompanying driving with her 53 year old mother .
city and dealer plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
in September , Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a and people from the region will re@@ discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre .
the commercial club and the city administration want to take advantage of the weekend on September 8th and 9th to enti@@ ce residents to shopping in the city centre .
as the chairman of the trade association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend should sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers to what offers the own city has to offer away from the usual supermarket goods .
according to this , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , local companies should present themselves with their training places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre are supposed to invite the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action is aimed not only on inhabitants of the city and the closer region .
in preparation , advertising spots on the radio , an internet video and printed p@@ ou@@ ches that indicate the action weekend , says Christian König .
the Municip@@ ality and Industry Association co @-@ operate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the business association and the city are thus entering a further stage of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive City &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes new offers such as the first &quot; Active Day &quot; for the well @-@ appointed Sunday , with sold Sunday , talks with all the tra@@ des@@ men and hosts , in order to move them to active participation .
attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potential is to be re@@ opened or re@@ opened .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals lost sight of the city center while shopping .
in the end , everyone would have to contribute to en@@ li@@ ven the city centre - to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that partly wi@@ dened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in the spring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that the nation &apos;s third &quot; home shopping &quot; day , for the first time , took part in five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities .
apart from Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , these are Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote appreciation of local trade and increase its importance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action led by the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with his purchase behaviour can influence his own direct environment .

Tr@@ ump set after le@@ aked tran@@ scripts of phone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the boundary wall
tran@@ scripts of phone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and drivers of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January Tr@@ ump asked the Mexican president En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to stop saying that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
the US President le@@ aded him because he had publicly den@@ ounced the Wall . according to him , he said to him , &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project .
tran@@ scripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia would assume &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was im@@ par@@ ted by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he proposed a ban on the reloc@@ ation of refugees to the US .
Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ year @-@ old Ford Mer@@ cury proc@@ eeded through a group of spectators in Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men emerged with guns to block its path .
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a middle @-@ aged man in a pin@@ stri@@ ped suit - took a long train at his ci@@ gar and looked around the wind@@ shield .
inside , the occup@@ ants moved in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; the man ro@@ ared .
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ams tore down the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged by the passenger seat .
luckily this terrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , is only a reproduction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown , almost everyone in the audience sounded very real si@@ ghs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , citizens are coming back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night where two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - have been syn@@ ched by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever indic@@ ted for the murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that not one person was arrested in all these years - although we see them in our congregations , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps organisation of post@@ production . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year old con@@ gres@@ s@@ man of the State of Georgia and a lifetime of civil rights activ@@ ist .
it serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that an injustice never has been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want the end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot achieve healing and reconciliation until we obtain justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a bai@@ li@@ ff covers the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ chen on 27 July 1946 .
according to FB@@ I files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ching process .
but no one was ever indic@@ ted .
although the susp@@ ects remain free for decades , citizens &apos; rights say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the black people in Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer campaign .
approximately at the same time as the election , according to the FB@@ I , black farmers Roger Mal@@ col@@ m had a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ ors in the city had been that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore was not her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , according to the FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they removed from the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who prepared and arranged the mur@@ ders , concludes with an FB@@ I report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removed evidence and obsc@@ ured the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an election law massacre &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register and when you vote , this will happen to you . &quot;
for nearly a decade Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual review of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is vivid , gri@@ pping , and is rooted in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , many of whom want to believe that he no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and still harder to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that &apos;s the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about Lyn@@ ching because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve done through . &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest bl@@ acks - pushed into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ enes co @-@ director .
he has played the role of the boss @-@ clan member for years , but he said the role never becomes easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not that way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room the actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ col@@ m , scre@@ aming the high priest and pushing him down , fur@@ i@@ ously that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; --- he , win@@ ch away from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he rep@@ lies the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ ing at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what ? ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asked Ras@@ Alfasud . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still chu@@ ck@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think white people said &apos; n --- he &apos; said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black performers t@@ wit@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to meet the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a sense of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ie sub@@ stitutes the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time , when she says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition is violent and fast .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman clothed with a grief of sad@@ ness stands above the bodies of the actors and performs Bil@@ lie Holidays as a &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred metres behind it , a group of about four dozen viewers sp@@ ells sweat and tears from their eyes .
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many only come down the road .
they have experienced the humidity of Geor@@ gi@@ as for almost eight hours , when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the graves of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands on the same country , where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y .
when the final notes of the song end , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the corp@@ ses .
children sit on their heads , register the fake blood and the quiet body and whis@@ per one another .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little boy mur@@ m@@ urs as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , Gre@@ ene thank@@ ed the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the ly@@ n@@ ch rope and wipe out their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ zy@@ hu@@ gs two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that it is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done this for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience joined the actors for dinner .
at one table , a white couple from Atlanta chat@@ ted about the post@@ war with a black pair that they just got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words which feel the performance left .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people that look like you and do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ching is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called only police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone is holding Broo@@ ks &apos;s court at his table , eating and remember@@ ing the civil rights .
he said he had already started planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the delivery is inspiring in a way because it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dä@@ mm@@ erung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans to Bay@@ reuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf focuses on a colourful and fri@@ vol@@ ous staging of a gigantic six @-@ story setting .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) either shows a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner , including the Wall B@@ rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ in and E@@ la@@ ste &quot; logo from the GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .

the audience thanks the ensemble with a strong applause .
Fo@@ ster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and Con@@ duc@@ tor Jan@@ owski are solem@@ n@@ ly celebrated . he mo@@ dest@@ ly bows his hands to Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te .
there is a big applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual leisure clothes .
the performance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors was eag@@ erly awa@@ ited .
had he had to endure a g@@ onal whi@@ stling concert in 2013 , there was a great rejo@@ icing five years later , in which the scattered &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls went down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have been pleased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you realize that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the public has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it is also an understanding of its view .
I draw a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
Max amount works as a volunteer
they work at several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : usually in st@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture market , once a week I help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I also worked at school already in the open whole day .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it is a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ called volunteer .
how does this come about ?
amount : I made S@@ LC .
and then a degree in civil engineering , we say , successfully broken off .
I recognized for myself that it is my fal@@ seh@@ ood for me and I want to do something different to work with people .
and then I asked myself what do you do .
do a social year , there &apos;s an insight , there you can see how it is on the spot , at the focal point maybe , really .
and was it like that ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in social engineering in the winter semester .
I will study dual , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ n Her@@ ne a social worker education and study in Ham@@ m at the university of applied sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends where you make your FS@@ J .
it is possible to do it from the retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
in a different way than studying civil engineering ?
quantity : well , here it is not a matter of calculating stup@@ ken .
there are always other people in front of you who have a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee , whether a youth who has been fet@@ ched out of the family - you have to go into it individually .
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have any reservations ?
amount : I &apos;m not the type for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , a lot of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is the same .
Pear@@ son is dropping another 3,000 jobs and dropping divi@@ den@@ ds to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that it will replace another 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure the company faces .
job cuts , which General Director John Fall@@ on announced for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , in addition to his previous restructuring , where 4,000 jobs have already been lost .
Pear@@ son announced in May a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in a third cost cutting program to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid pace of digital learning .
the company , which had sold its shar@@ ehol@@ ding in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to Ber@@ tel@@ smann AG last month , said that the outlook for the financial year remains unchanged , after an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kab@@ ul con@@ voy &apos;s attack : NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in Kab@@ ul , the Afgh@@ an capital , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , distributed a NATO Declaration .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died during the incident in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district .
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan hit this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in a statement by NATO , the explosion on Thursday evening was said to have occurred when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device . &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital on the B@@ agra@@ m air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Tali@@ ban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a big concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agra@@ m .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , suicide bom@@ b@@ ings killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Tali@@ ban said they had done this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bom@@ b@@ ings in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack in the country since the US @-@ led troops in 2001 displaced the Tali@@ ban from power .
the violence under@@ scores the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering increasing the number of U.S. forces supporting military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , its policies and in particular in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA returns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to complaints
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay a regulation of the Obama administration , repe@@ aled that states are obliged to contain the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this occurred a day after 15 States accused the agency because of the step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EP@@ O announced the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ zone regulation 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday and said it shows the agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in the dialogue with and by re@@ acting to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced in June the intention of the EPA to determine the o@@ zone determination in which pollut@@ ant emissions are to be measured in a part of the country to determine where cuts need to be made to delay stric@@ ter air quality standards - in order to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to drive back a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda , which , according to Tr@@ ump , should boost economic growth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ back of Democrats and nature reserves who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the website of EPA says that inhal@@ ing air containing o@@ zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
common room wants community space
in the end , the decision was clear : in two counter@@ parts , the Municipal Council decides to set up a joint space in the future retirement home .
before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the remaining part of the land is signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it will take a while until the area belonging to the church community has been in the community , there is no planning obstacle for the project to be stem@@ med from a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common space .
one of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a surface area of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the municipal council v@@ owed that such a common room could not be seen as a meeting point only for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ ent dwelling , but openly into the congregation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ nit@@ wear café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget is sweet@@ ened by funding opportunities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is in the renovation area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the establishment of a common room would be , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the proposed proposition is that in order to signal the investor that in this respect it is impossible to throw a bil@@ l@@ board between the legs , the statement that both sem@@ it@@ rail@@ - and pul@@ p roof - which reduces the height and makes the construction of economic power - would be possible .
unnecessary , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer thinks , be this addition .
when it helps : unanim@@ ously , he passes the body .
it &apos;s not as easy as the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call points to the many own buildings with which one does not move so much forward , but now we lean on the common room from the window , she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very difficult with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is definitely talking about the common room - but absolutely against a municipal involvement .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t sub@@ vention of assets or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the purchase of the surface one does not grant a subsi@@ dy , but I get a real , dou@@ bt@@ ful counter @-@ value , is the counter @-@ speech .
Sta@@ y &apos;s proposal to ple@@ ad the proposed resolution finds three pro@@ pon@@ ents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two opposing voices at the original programme that summari@@ zes Stefan H@@ aller : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we take the decision in such a way , we make a giant leap to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision by car : cyclists are thrown on the road
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured in Gar@@ ath on Wednesday by a car and seriously injured .
as the police announced , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was travelling on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg from Hil@@ den on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg .
the senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver , driving in the same direction , gave priority to him .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder drove to the street , he obviously did not heed the on@@ coming traffic .
he joined a car with a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was transported to a hospital with a return carriage .
FC Bayern Munich must ren@@ ounce the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup does not take place without him : David Al@@ aba must leave the game against Dortmund .
with personnel care , the FC Bayern will be travelling to Dortmund for the first obligatory play of the new season .
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
personnel care at German soccer @-@ record champion Bayern München are getting bigger in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 h / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must also ren@@ ounce David Al@@ aba in du@@ el with BV@@ B .
the Italian confirmed this on Friday .
the Mun@@ ch@@ ecker Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six test games , An@@ cel@@ otti has held the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this was not good at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 58 @-@ year @-@ old , however , believes in a performance increase in the first official obligatory play of the season .
&quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a difficult and intense game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights draws the fans into their spell .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday .
in the resin from star to star hike
&quot; &quot; &quot; the nationwide first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star trail &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to emerge in the resin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is planned by the Association of Observ@@ atory Saint Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a Plan@@ etary Trail in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star trail &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accommo@@ dates the need for information of many resin visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it connects nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to place tables along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ accessible installations to five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
In@@ quiry is St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber .
the information on the boards should be supplemented by the internet .
this is why a good mobile network receipt plays a role in the selection of locations .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later , the Star@@ trail Ticket is to be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star@@ base , the viewer experiences much worth knowing , for example on the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star more lumin@@ aire than another , although it was much further away .
also , in which con@@ stellation you will find a selected star and when it is best to see .
the association has been operating the highest observ@@ atory Northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg since 2014 .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
since 2003 , at the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen , there is something similar to the planned Star@@ wer@@ g - the Plan@@ etary Trail .
starting from Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary Trail leads up to H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; off @-@ terrestrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( community of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to down@@ gra@@ ded to the d@@ warf planet - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks so to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun &apos;s exactly 75 meters distance measures 70 centimet@@ ers .
the entire distance of the planet is about four kilometres .
while the light from Sun to Plu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
thus , pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fixed star , however , would last half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko are meeting for the first time , discussing a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who should stand in a collision course in order to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the defeated World Bo@@ xing Council lightweight champion , went down the corridor to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko to the World Bo@@ xing Organisation Super Spring @-@ weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia put his right hand out and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ ma noted that a possible show@@ down would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather , &quot; rec@@ alled Gar@@ cia .
&quot; I grew up for Bron@@ x &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not that big .
I am small for 140 .
I want to come down to lightweight .
and he must move to light weight ler &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that is what the fans ask .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
climate asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that must fight Lom@@ ach@@ enko with a 135 pound debut this year to schedule next summer with Gar@@ cia a date ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their light weight title fight in the forum on September 23rd .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans asked for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said , and later openly expressed himself openly to fight with the network offering the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he considers Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday battle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko thanks the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks that the tri@@ athlon champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slowly , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the co @-@ off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact , then boxing .
both said they could feel the momentum that was built up for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the fight that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four injuries to a tire burst
in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were seriously injured in the afternoon .
after initial information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control of his vehicle shortly before the end of the market , shortly before the market square in front of the market square .
the car hur@@ led to the right into the slope , where it over@@ came and then remained on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service , the A@@ 7 was closed to the north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left passenger strip could be passed by the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; three chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes for the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , that the optimization of the defense formation in Au@@ e points scores points .
Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy with the first round of the season , with the result that the two opponents were not at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to watch out in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fort@@ una Düsseldorf &apos;s defense player . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the three chain is to be further optimized .
and a gate after a free kick won &apos;t catch the For@@ tun@@ ers any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be so that no one will stand alongside Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be better able to cope better with the three @-@ chain , than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we have just been able to build up the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann , who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we harmon@@ ize even better and we are not able to afford so many ab@@ err@@ ations in construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann travels to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can speak of a failed start after a draw , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we are at four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly be able to speak of a good season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing about this .
&quot; I only judged the start into the season after six to eight working days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled pre@@ mat@@ urely due to a thunder@@ storm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann thinks that the players from Au@@ e might be even more fresh as they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una for a promotion favorite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know so 100 % where they are at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the inner def@@ ensi@@ sts of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the guests from the Rhin@@ eland are a light favorite on Sunday in the encounter at the finally ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we swe@@ ep them away , just because we have the right to come under the first six is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance in only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games is quite positive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the second Bundes@@ liga which you have to hit from the start , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as Chief coach .
&quot; such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el wants to experience his players on Sunday in no case .
new results of Swedish asylum @-@ old application tests published
recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have undergone a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the people tested are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started the tests last year .
during the asylum procedure , they should make the estim@@ ation of age more accurate after the Swedish migration authority ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) was critici@@ zed for errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees who were minor years old .
to date , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6.@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 .
ei@@ ghty per cent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been steady in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the figures are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was assessed as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
in May the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there were 4@@ 42 cases that suggest that the investigated person was 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det under@@ took the results published in 5@@ 81 , she found out that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had frank@@ ly said that she will be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical retirement , in which x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints are made , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves the evaluation of the biological maturity of people to see whether they were sooner or later than usual through pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used .
to judge the biological age in this way is very uns@@ af@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we can &apos;t say it certainly , we shouldn &apos;t do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; generally , you can say that the risk of having a child as an adult is in@@ correctly judged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is , if the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
a seven @-@ ton@@ ne concrete section was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good in time , it works great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , head of the road and traffic department in the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April the work started at the same time on all three rehabilitation @-@ needy bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule will be kept .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , crosses the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is an arch bridge made of concrete , cla@@ d with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has meanwhile arrived in the years .
to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .
the other two bridges lead over Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now been preserved on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons weigh@@ ted so @-@ called bridge cap .
this is a border for@@ tification , which is also used as operating road .
a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday at the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is to go .
the special thing about this is that they are finished parts , a patent of the company Sch@@ ram@@ berger Company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridge caps .
special finger@@ tip @-@ feeling has required the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable where many companies are connected .
the local residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
in addition , fish and cru@@ stac@@ e@@ ans had to be f@@ ished initially .
for the bridges between the building yard and the collective trail in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light .
for the construction work on the bridge at Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance , the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully blocked .
the costs for the three bridge installations amount to 700 000 euros .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : under protest with German potato salad
it is not so common for parties to pull together , but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to reconci@@ le .
the political parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , the left ) are part of a wide alliance , which shows a peaceful flag this day , because the Af@@ D invites R@@ ond@@ ell to play a big campaign for election in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle .
and well @-@ known names start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land the top duo for the German election on September 24 , and vice @-@ chairman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ lern but demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eifel remains colourful &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally , the city picnic under the motto &quot; All on a table &quot; was planned on the well square , but now takes place on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ elle - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful picture that offers itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair of the Forum A World and one of the author@@ itative organizers , is really pleased : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great how many people have come together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and a lot of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rustic potato salad , which also the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police has ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence especially at the railway station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Nor@@ pes of the Af@@ D volcano is reported to have made an effort to get such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf lived in demand in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because there were not enough parking spaces due to the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the R@@ ond@@ elle , Hom@@ emade is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; looking at the event at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does : around 8@@ pm there is a band for entertainment at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , in the Stad@@ thalle various speakers , among them the Rheinland @-@ Pfalz Af@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe Junge .
there are about 200 people in the hall waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Vice @-@ President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch to keep their speeches .
the police presence is unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening .
the Af@@ D event takes a little more than an hour , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can shift away - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a meeting with the Wolf@@ man tro@@ mb@@ one Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the row Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ Concer@@ tos tomorrow , Sunday , at 8@@ pm in the monastery church .
together with Bulgarian Tr@@ ump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets classical German training with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have scored solo positions in European top @-@ class orchest@@ ras .
Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the solo@@ ist at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire to cross not only the borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new gown , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; unites with Bulgarian folklore , and in the play &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz player N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free play blend into a fascinating complete artwork .
this core of the program was first performed this spring with a huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously involved in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try it all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart was quite openly about bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was that of her &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately dealt with bitter@@ ness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in spite of all this , the brun@@ ette act@@ ress ass@@ ures the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was seriously in love for everyone I have been looking for . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived du@@ alism and seriously believed in it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so I &apos;ve never been confused or imp@@ eded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I never liked being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she especially suffered from it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but in the school time she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really hurt me very much .
when I was eleven the children told me that I would look like a boy .
I felt really attacked , frigh@@ tened and humili@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think to myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the public doesn &apos;t like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you to keep you in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some consider me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself from all the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
the Democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening in a rally with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you a lot of prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a trainer , I would say that it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised earlier a big announcement at the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won the West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the Democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
justice , according to For@@ bes , is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime , on Thursday evening , the Republi@@ can National Committee gave an explanation in which it said : &quot; the change of party from Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party which would prevent us from working on it to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party from above to below , and unable to find a positive , engaging message , &quot; said the R@@ NC president Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious ap@@ ology from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated it wasn &apos;t the moment for the country to be included in the sport again .
Russian athle@@ tics boss D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he was determined to combat dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes who were taken away from competitions of gold and silver med@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress approved for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence of state funded dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e to the repor@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation recognized in itself that it has experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepts the criteria for his re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle always was that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes compete in the athle@@ tics World Championships which begin on Friday in London according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for re @-@ adjustment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still insufficient and forbidden trainers are still free , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told repor@@ ters in London after a lecture at IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
funeral Act for Sol@@ di@@ ers Ab@@ und@@ ated in Mali
at a funeral service in Frit@@ z@@ lar on the north of Hessen , around 1,000 people of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
the Minister of Defence , Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) , said nothing about the un@@ solved problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she described the two opposite pilots but as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ow@@ ning their specialist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow before this highest sacrifice which they have done in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen came to life on Wednesday a week ago in Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a vi@@ gil of the Bundes@@ wehr into the frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom San Pietro .
at noon only the relatives in the church took leave .
after that , the funeral service in the circle of the family , closest friends , of representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and the politics began .
among them were H@@ esse &apos;s Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general contractor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
the relatives of the mour@@ ners lay down roses , the relatives were arm @-@ arm @-@ arm in the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Defence of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Le@@ yen described the surrounding soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sat@@ ini@@ zed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sta@@ ve @-@ captain has built the flight operations of the fighting helicopter Tiger at Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regi@@ ment .
Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regi@@ ment to which the soldiers belong , said : &quot; if this occupation could not turn away the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doubt on the UN mission in Mali , Minister of the Le@@ yen did not show : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use is dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral service the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they were buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife
the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
that shared the Royal House on Thursday .
the Danish royal couple is traditionally buried in the Ros@@ kil@@ de cathedral church .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision , and she said further in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , be still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have liked to become a king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 , he retired and also laid down the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prince Su@@ pper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equal to his wife - even not after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the spokes@@ woman of the Danish royal house , declared .
it is still unclear where the last resting place of the 83 year old will ultimately be .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he worked for the last 50 years .
born in 1965 , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ tra@@ z@@ at , the son of a French no@@ bility , met Mar@@ gre@@ the in London .
he was working on the Th@@ ames in the French embassy .
during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people were always hel@@ pless , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy duty with the Dan@@ es in his almost 50 @-@ year reign .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik vo@@ iced over the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was gay , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk h@@ ul@@ ls instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ l@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and which in this country had the reputation of being the brand of socio @-@ critical intellectu@@ als , I could not hope for len@@ i@@ ency .
I was different .
I seemed to be content with this position and not to be ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants to quickly re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of potential majority in Lower Saxony
Nieder@@ sach@@ sens Minister @-@ President Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the Land@@ tag , but he does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because on Friday he spoke for the dissolution of the parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
prior to this , the surprising res@@ ignation of a Gre@@ ens MP from their Land@@ tag fraction in Lower Saxony pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the Parliament election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ voice majority in parliament to the opposition from the CD@@ U and the F@@ DP .
the former Green MP El@@ ke T@@ westen founded her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) in 2018 .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his faction to record it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far , the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be elected regularly on the 14th of January .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether it could continue to rule without a majority in this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Stephan Wei@@ l considers it indispensable that the Land@@ tag decides as soon as possible its self resolution .
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also provides the possibility that the Land@@ tag depri@@ ves the Prime Minister of trust and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these opportunities must be checked legally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will calm@@ ly discuss all the questions if they are legally insp@@ ected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ west &apos;s step &quot; but something strange . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she described herself as a follow@@ er of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called on the dissi@@ dent dep@@ u@@ ties to restore their state mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume , of course , that it gives back its Land@@ tag mandate , which it received through the green national list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she deliberately decided not to pron@@ ounce any pron@@ unciation in the group . &quot; &quot; &quot;

SPD chan@@ cell@@ or Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transgres@@ sion of the Lower Saxony &apos;s Green Party MEP El@@ ke T@@ westen on CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Green Party dep@@ u@@ ties in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of Red @-@ Green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the Federal Social Democrats leader on Facebook on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supports Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) decision to quickly elect the Land@@ tag .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony is taking part in this dirty intri@@ gu@@ ing game and tries to turn it into political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nieder@@ sachsen &apos;s CD@@ U group leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his dep@@ u@@ ties to include El@@ ke T@@ ests in the CD@@ U .
the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused T@@ ests of fal@@ si@@ fying the result of the 2013 Parliament election with personal career prospects .
at that time , the CD@@ U was the strongest force of the SPD , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of one vote in the parliament .
Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from po@@ isons , Herr Schmidt ?
Germany discusses the inf@@ ested eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister for Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , is in an interview with the German Editor Network ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the pressure on the stamp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the Bundes@@ länder will present the latest information about the affected eggs bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
also , if , after all , what we are currently aware of , a health hazard is virtually excluded .
is Al@@ di now taking the best possible crisis response - all eggs get out of the range - because the central role of the clari@@ fier is not really noticed by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house has stopped immediately and since the announcement of the dis@@ may of Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk assessments are available to consumers .
just like the manufacturers , trade has to ensure that the products sold are transpor@@ table and harmless to health .
if the residual oil content of the eggs exceeds 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , they are not market@@ able .
however , un@@ polluted eggs can be sold and consumed .
this time not the farms are to blame .
do production companies and consumers sit in the same boat ?
according to current knowledge , the production companies do not meet any immediate blame .
on the contrary , they must expect economic damages due to the presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies .
as always , there is too little control in case of seri@@ ousness .
is there only a lack of personnel or a conclu@@ sive back@@ war@@ dness ?
it was just the official controls that have uncovered the process .
the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded from 100 percent .
it is precisely this reason that a consistent enlightenment of such events and the transfer to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where crimes can be submitted are of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made it clear that I expected a complete enlightenment from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the regular alarm system necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to only get safe and market@@ able food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a non @-@ cash insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly drunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result of the company , manufacturers , retailers and consumers get into a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
in principle , it must be clear that the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ supplying animals is not acceptable and must be stopped immediately .
this has to be done consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect from all the competent authorities that the facts will be clari@@ fied quickly and without gaps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the Fis@@ cal Rules of Football affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Mo@@ ving to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imp@@ eded output from European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s world record transfer from Barcelona to Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main , Spain .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of UEF@@ A , as the leading organisation that over@@ sees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious UEF@@ A Champions League tournament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial Fair Play rules , launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G has to prove that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without major losses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to purchase the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary which will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can certainly make money loose so that N@@ ey@@ mar is signing and bringing him to a gal@@ axy of other stars in the face of the financing of the team by the ruling family of Qatar .
associations are allowed to spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but must pay with legitimate income sources , which allow them to break even point in their activities related to football .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success , were effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ king to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentrating on the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tough@@ er matter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the current three @-@ year run @-@ off period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and although Plat@@ ini &apos;s popularity has fallen from the Pres@@ i@@ dency in 2015 , his successor , Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , continues to sc@@ are off excessive expendi@@ tures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a l@@ ump sum , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing over the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract so that the selling prices for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 brought the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of € 60 million ( $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wit their financial supervision by puff@@ ing up their revenues associated with the owners of a club .
while a cat@@ fish company could sponsor PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ship should exceed the standard market rates , UEF@@ A would not count this as a legitimate income .
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when UEF@@ A decided that the value of sponsor@@ ing the P@@ SA was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could be due to payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar World Championship amb@@ ass@@ adors will be and such a manoeu@@ vre for UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could be easy to find out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will still be more attentive to ignore any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
UEF@@ A had no preliminary talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke on the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not allowed to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than € 10 million with sales of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
accounts for the last financial year must still be published .
PS@@ G anticip@@ ates that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s arrival is a blessing for sponsor@@ ship deals , merchan@@ dising and jer@@ sey sales .
the association expects sales to rise by at least 30 percent after signing the contract .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players go and they tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos; move by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of La Liga , Ja@@ vier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state financed by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair play because there are different ways or can have different interests if a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new source supplier
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has made board chocolate for Swiss .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the sweet co @-@ operation is coming to an end : the airline will re@@ write the order . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott also confirmed a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to current planning , the airline will contract a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products are insp@@ ected every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokesperson .
some 17 million small red @-@ white packed womb plates distribute up to 14 grams per year before landing to the passengers .
Swiss Life did not want to give any information about the costs .
industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders according to &quot; Nor@@ thwest Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a manufacturer of shock @-@ gi@@ vers .
Swiss Life does not want to reveal how many applicants are in the new tender .
however , only Swiss manufacturers come into question .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the contract beyond spring 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not at@@ tain@@ able for a comment .
Swiss has been distributing chocolate tablets since 2006 on board their flights .
Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has delivered the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hu@@ g before the Swiss signed a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary .
Swiss Life introduced the possibility to place the logo at the start of cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y two and a half years ago .
the airline operates with various Swiss Cho@@ colate producers .
on long @-@ haul flights , the customers of the First Class with treats will be p@@ am@@ pered by the conf@@ is@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class the passengers scho@@ gg@@ i von Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Scho@@ ol@@ at of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i distri@@ butes also Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in Business and Economy Class .

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &apos;s , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ Gr@@ unge era ( when the pioneer David W@@ ain and Michael Show switched the sket@@ ch comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to larger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ ody and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era of permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels as if the time was scar@@ ce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; func@@ tioned surprisingly well , not just because of its absurd humour ( it contained an original story for an appealing D@@ ose vegetable spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by sti@@ cking to the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play cool kids who will grow up - nevertheless , they managed to win the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ten Years L@@ ater &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; with his adults now playing adults , is less emotional and his par@@ ody works more on the casting ration@@ ale , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90@@ s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at one point , a character through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of other things from 1991 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gracious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there &apos;s another crazy vi@@ cious plot , included in the Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ spoken impression by Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it &apos;s a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ on &apos;s sub @-@ li@@ pp@@ age of &quot; sing@@ les , &quot; whose former big man @-@ on @-@ camp Andy feels like an old cra@@ cker .
these are the moments of accidental ma@@ dness that could heat this fran@@ chise as one kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until it reaches what I consider as its logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the band premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon now re@@ members another kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War by &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its East @-@ versus @-@ West Ring @-@ I@@ con@@ ography .
the comedy with Rh@@ ys Thomas , created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka , announces to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alo@@ gues are syn@@ ced by Ch@@ anning Tart@@ um ( also an executive producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it &apos;s a brilliant idea .
but it &apos;s not much more than an idea .
there are some nice gi@@ mmi@@ cks to look at ( the police sp@@ ends the time watching chess on TV , as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent play &apos; Find out the voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ ag@@ an mask is involved - that it often plays like a single .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are six long episodes , and the comedy is not fast or often enough . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; com@@ rade det@@ ective , &quot; which was edited down to a lesser length , could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , as Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef continue to visit the American Embassy , whose Lobby is always occupied by two big men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the imagined Communist audience is that Western culture can make everything as food for a ban@@ quet .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with theirs .
strike against Dru@@ gs @-@ Ma@@ fia in the Land
the police managed to strike the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar circle , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office announced on Friday .
15 defend@@ ants were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
in addition , the officials ensured larger amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros .
in the case of time @-@ like ra@@ ids in Italy two people were arrested .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans .
the two will probably be extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
in this action , Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved .
more than 300 police officers were in action .
the Ma@@ fia &apos;s members are accused of organised drug crime , violent acts of violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating the situation against organised drug traffi@@ cking in southern Germany .
between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and investig@@ ators from Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil were in close contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
that is why the Grand Master was accompanied by four civil servants from Palermo on Wednesday morning .
in particular , Italian citizens with close relation to the Italian ma@@ fia came to the sights of the investigations .
also a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the account of the gang .
fashion lam@@ ent large gaps in the foreigners register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not show up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany has significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious wrong decisions regarding asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the Federal Government Commissioner Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise began to draw attention to large gaps in the immigration centre register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the data registered there could lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; serious wrong decisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , in an analysis present in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the data , ten million people with a foreign nationality are registered , including some 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore managed by approximately 600 immigration authorities in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the data had not been sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found &quot; by people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register anymore . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data entries can significantly slow reverse processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , in statistics on people who are liable to pay , EU citizens are also included who do not have to leave at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these false regulations , however , led to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a distorted debate on dealing with foreigners &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that is , in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy with children under 16 years of age if they have travelled from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is due to an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the paper , it is stated that the BA@@ MF will carry out such procedures &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - after Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , as the newspaper cli@@ cked on the difficult situation on the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement , it is responsible for refugees from the EU state they first reach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a migrant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the immig@@ rant country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with children of under@@ age in Italy has considerably increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy gave guarantees to the reception and accommodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments sufficiently .
other EU states would also return refugees to the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the domestic spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing group in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children are threatening un@@ lawful reception conditions and a threat to child welfare because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach already provided the blood donation service to other people .
at least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
above all Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who with his 100 donations meanwhile shared 50 litres of blood .
traditionally , at the meeting of the Municipal Council , the congregation acknow@@ le@@ dges the multiple willingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ingeni@@ ous how our body is designed for it and we pay respect to the don@@ ors who make their blood available to strangers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ lined Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the county leader of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the cann@@ ed are de@@ composed into their components . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three people could profit from a blood donation .
at the same time , corn maker reported of the actions carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 contribut@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K circle team leader . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the shift to the theatre house led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago .
previously , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Stra@@ w@@ l were among the multiple donations and were awarded for 50 donations .
half of so many book Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ o@@ thee Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter voted for ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of their life @-@ juice .
the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged since the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation over a rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it retained the interest rates on family income in the midst of a growing pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members striving for a rise in this month as the weak economic growth weakened the support for an increase .
in its quarterly inflation forecast , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and 1.6 % for 2017 and warned that the pressure on household income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in autumn .
but it sign@@ alized that in the next few years , interest increases would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation stimulated by the Bre@@ x@@ it and it said that the loan cost might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw a part of the M@@ amm@@ ut economic package published one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks as of next February , although it is expected that it will now be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , since the pressure on the real income of households continues to strain consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the interest rates it was repeated that &quot; a certain tightening of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; somewhat larger &quot; extent than the markets expected .
the markets are forec@@ asting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s downward @-@ adjusted growth forecasts for this and next year are forecast for 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the forecast in May .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations on interest increase and GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth in the third quarter is expected to be 0.3 % , although it will recover slightly at the end of the year .
the latest inflation forecast showed little enthusiasm for households , which are affected by rising inflation and minor rise increases , as the tightening gets worse at first before it gets better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that in the coming years monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ comes from in@@ comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she added that wages at the end of their three year forecast can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clearly &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also boo@@ sted by the rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak Po@@ und , which compens@@ ates for a proportion of lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes a year after lowering the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU referendum , which caused the fall of the pound .
the Bank appreci@@ ates that it will probably take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s last judgment on interest rates , the call for a rise in interest has risen , as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers demanding an increase of 0.5 % in July .
inflation decreased from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said it was expected and will attract it again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that the excess in relation to its target of 2 % is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wholly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attributable to the weak Po@@ und . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , director of Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent decline in swap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , as the credi@@ tors are looking for businesses lou@@ dly and want to end the year in a positive way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals run out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages take out , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) urged to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment in September following a fight against the High Court against the financing of the drug in the N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ exposure pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) taken before sexual intercourse , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now being delivered by the health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appe@@ al confirmed last year &apos;s ruling that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England Chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive moment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool , and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to enable the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October before being introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ p pre@@ p is a result of HIV medicines taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious diseases .
taking pre@@ p prior to intercourse means that just enough medication exists in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who question the treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and individuals with HIV @-@ positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics , suitable participants will be identified who agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gender and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation at their local participating sexu@@ ality clinic .
the program will sign £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week after an international competitive sourcing .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence on a large scale targeted , recorded and implemented .
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in addressing one of humanity &apos;s greatest health challenges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive Officer at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pre@@ p , aimed at targeted and vulnerable people , offers the possibility of modi@@ fying the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Board of Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority now is to ensure that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now that the pre@@ p test medicine has been obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , Shadow Health Minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is conducted as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV infected and that it will help us to step closer to the eradic@@ ation of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living the Great Life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced herself from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment in 2014 .
it is on the first floor of an elegant queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived in a much bigger space with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge , &quot; Jo@@ anne says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was looking for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot large apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the generous deck height optimally .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12@@ ,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the issue .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only about building a simple platform but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama .
a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us over@@ looks the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area for the mezzanine .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illumination set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater , space and light .
at both ends a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to make it work longer .
in the kitchen , the mirr@@ oring feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
by the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little bit of engineering went inside , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important , so if you push the door , it &apos;s very easy to slide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to increase the floor space while using high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not fall in love with electrical outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself by a good design and increased square meter of some standard into something completely amazing .
in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them .
brothers fighting for a 500 million US dollar real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a confrontation over one of Victori@@ as &apos;s largest real estate agents worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Tennis @-@ Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul .
Paul wanted to reti@@ re from family business since 2014 , but a sharp confrontation over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars since the family purchased a business at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood in 1973 .
this was where the West@@ co family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail shops .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
this money was invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis portfolio now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in - Paul was described as &quot; the main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about a third .
a court record states that this means that Col@@ in owns property worth $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul worth $ 17@@ 6 million .
the allocation of real estate and cash has proved to be a turning point for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the commissions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first affir@@ m@@ v@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .
the Brothers are now struggling to control the existing business - from which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but th@@ rows Paul to manage some possessions in@@ competent .
in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage stipul@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs increase in the event of hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter C@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both parties .
wife De Lu@@ tis and her de@@ ceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delic@@ at@@ ess@@ ens from the late 1950s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they took advantage of the safety to buy Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in Col@@ in &apos;s first je@@ ep @-@ shop .
Col@@ in says he started in West@@ co there when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to keep their property safe to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group of companies , with Col@@ in claims that Mark had paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars when he left the company .
both Luke and Mark are , Paul says , &quot; the terms of their financial separation have become em@@ bit@@ tered . &quot;
Col@@ in with@@ drew very much , although he was a former AF@@ L member and after a biography from Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire in 2015 , Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in responded by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case was before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and drag our family name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to meet his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , adding that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our issue will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new Chief of Staff Tr@@ um@@ ps plans to limit the media abst@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Politi@@ co reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including news media reports - hoping to hold the boss on a more consistent course .
here is a piece by Repor@@ ter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with senior executives on his first working day , he was a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House that he wanted to repair : poor information that came into the hands of the president .
Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame tears by monitoring his media diet .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s relationship with television is spann@@ ing decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the candidate Tr@@ ump was anno@@ yed due to unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were to convince , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election campaign manager Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February to Politi@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; political Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter habit under control , according to six former election campaig@@ ners , is to ensure that his personal media consumption ent@@ ails a steady praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s Twitter habit was ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know - that Tr@@ um@@ ps T@@ we@@ ets could contain even more fuel without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump did not send .
if his staff made it a few times to keep trouble from him , their efforts have been worthwhile .
but nobody has consistently been able to prevent Tr@@ ump &apos;s controversy .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , try again and again to present their own agenda by presenting dump material that possibly promotes their views from the world .
Politi@@ co - devoted entirely to this story - reported in May about the preference of the advis@@ ers to provide dou@@ bt@@ ful information to the President for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by Repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former pump officials say that Tr@@ ump , like a volcano , can react to negative press releases , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he insi@@ sts on figur@@ ing out where they come from .
this was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone mali@@ ci@@ ously filed a printed copy of an article by Got@@ news@@ .com , the website of the Internet provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; being the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was permanently ex@@ iled from Twitter because of ch@@ ic@@ anes or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced up false alleg@@ ations and rev@@ oked them in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and began asking staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
gold makers added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the paper@@ work . &quot;
how did that work out ?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ers still strive for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most sought @-@ after criminals receive mail from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the help of the population is requested and hoped .
the police all over Europe send ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous criminals in this summer ( virtual ) postcards .
since the addresses of the sought after s@@ words are not known naturally , references from the population are raised and requested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday the action that follows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advent calendar from winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experience showed that many fle@@ eting frau@@ ds were hiding at holiday destinations , it was called Euro@@ pol .
there have been 21 postcards for sought @-@ after criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 there has been the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ view , more than 2.5 million times it has been viewed .
36 of the online requests could be det@@ ained up to now , at least eleven of them due to the fact that they were published on the website .
passengers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aire series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are once again confronted with some determined travelers at the foot of the war , who negotiated a dit@@ ch drawn by the municipality to rec@@ la@@ im a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside of a prosper@@ ous road of Soli@@ hull called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire series &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters , after they were thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch dig@@ ged by the Council in order to prevent their incur@@ sions .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense facilities and squee@@ zed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have afflicted the Council of Soli@@ hull saying that it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said , &quot; They moved there on Monday evening after they were forwarded by Bentley He@@ ath where they threw rocks on the pass@@ ers @-@ by .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced into action by shame to implement it as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers stayed there in May , were moved on and are now back again .
more came yesterday evening , probably even more today . &quot;
she added : &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long brief@@ ings to protect their parks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my church tax if the Council cannot stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of the residents who didn &apos;t want to be called said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we &apos;ve just seen the last round of these travelers just to be lo@@ oted from another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesperson for Soli@@ hull said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and cooperate with the Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls Police . we take the necessary legal steps to keep them moving as fast as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this contributes to creating an image of the situation in which the court must examine when we make our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and is to be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof due to the former Ambiente Operating Society mbH on April 13 , 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and recei@@ pts by the visitor &apos;s tax .
in the autumn of 2014 , in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the county , the hotel building was offered to the District Office as a gathering place , which caused controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers from setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the Municipal Council .
but above all Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties in the house at that time .
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otel with Managing Director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star Plus Categ@@ ory under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Men &apos;s al@@ b .
they are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof have been building shell containers in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is taking place .
the floors were torn out , ceilings partly disman@@ tled , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it &apos;s actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pretty bourgeois close &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer is expressing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment .
one does not want to sit at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale inner city level , Sch@@ erer stresses .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms , wants to spread wide , explains Sch@@ erer .
both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he has already had talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , Sch@@ erer .
the noti@@ ons of the city were identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
in demand of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to define precisely .
just under one million euros , he calcul@@ ates .
the outdoor installations are also brought to the front , which is clearly visible .
in a courtyard , there is a large terrace , which will be accessible from the restaurant , which is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : us Special Issu@@ er Re@@ places Grand Jury
in the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special investig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have deployed a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
the committee recorded the work in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; calling on people familiar with the matter .
the paper evaluated the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller had expanded and intensified his investigation .
the broad@@ caster CN@@ N reported that there were already first plenary meetings in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos; oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
us secret services acc@@ use the Krem@@ lin for some time interven@@ ing in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller investigated whether there were arrangements between Tr@@ um@@ ps election campaign team and Moscow .
the investigation focused on several men who acted as advis@@ ors to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the election campaign .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller took a closer look at more and more Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s private and business environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special agent Tr@@ ump personally pulled into the center and under@@ took the accus@@ ation whether the president could possibly hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jury is to examine the present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether a charge is to be charged .
Grand Jury are therefore also called Bil@@ ls of Indi@@ ct@@ ment .
mostly they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always done behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office in order to invite persons to take part under oath .
according to CN@@ N , invitations were already issued , which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who participated in the meeting had been invited to a statement , called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. also Tr@@ um@@ ps advis@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his former boss Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were part of the discussion .
legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the introduction showed that Mu@@ eller would not in@@ timi@@ date himself in his work and that if necessary , he wanted to act quickly .
but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the charging of an indictment .
nevertheless , the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revelations , the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to represent the Russia affair as a campaign of political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the theme gives the democr@@ ats a way to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor , T@@ y Cob@@ b , stated in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .
but I usually work in secret , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House rever@@ ber@@ ates any measures that accelerated the work of the special agent in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fa@@ ire &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former FB@@ I chief , James Com@@ ey , said three times that it would not be determined against the president . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no reason to assume that something had changed , it was stated in the statement .
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
because of this re@@ design , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump had become lou@@ der , he wanted to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
Com@@ ey sat in front of a Senate committee in June , Tr@@ ump asked him to set up an investigation against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
after displaying US media , the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees .
this triggered speculation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to release .
unlike an independent special agent of the Congress such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair about the later stepped up president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired at the ur@@ ging of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
several Sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Demo@@ crat Sen@@ ators presented draft charges on Thursday , after which the special investig@@ ator could no longer be dismissed so easily .
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : giant ic@@ e@@ berg driving in Antar@@ cti@@ ca
in the west @-@ Antar@@ ctic , a giant ic@@ e@@ berg of the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin has loos@@ ened from the ice shelf .
this was announced by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institut for polar and marine research on Wednesday .
the Kol@@ oss , weighing over a tri@@ l@@ lion tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , now drives to the north and will probably need two or three years until it melted .
with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered in the past three decades .
he does not risk a danger for people .
the extent to which climate change has played a role in the demo@@ lition of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear according to research information .
in total , however , there have been a series of unusual inter@@ ferences of ice cream cones in the region for about 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fac@@ simile background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the now abor@@ ted col@@ os@@ sus was part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ven .
Sch@@ el@@ ven is floating on the sea and is fed by big glaci@@ ers .
it therefore continues to grow into the sea and falls regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ven is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
to the north of this ice @-@ ice , the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ rupt was disturbed a couple of years ago .
a complete piece of shelf is broken down there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ shelf is in danger , as the front edge has never gone as far back as currently .
in addition , the ice sheet is under tension and can fall apart , if a piece breaks off at a key point .
melting of ice shelf and ic@@ e@@ berg does not increase the sea level as it is floating on the water and squee@@ zes ice so much water as it produces after melting itself .
however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only to a small extent , the British research project writes on the observation of Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ shelf is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antar@@ cti@@ ca with almost 50,000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters .
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural phenomenon and has no direct connection to climate change , the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest withdrawal since the beginning of the recordings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists have argued that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ven will grow back or fall back in the long term and possibly coinci@@ de , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even if these scientists do not lead the departure of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , many ice cre@@ ators of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart over the past few decades .
this long cycle of Antar@@ cti@@ ca stretches towards South America .
according to the research programme British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the Antar@@ ctic Survey of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the increase in temperature contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has been around three degrees in the last 50 years and thus count among the areas where the temperature rises rapidly .
CD@@ U wants ho@@ ar@@ frost by the staff
because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vac@@ ant jobs , the CD@@ U demands from the employers &apos; association to step out to become more attractive .
just before the summer break , 41 new jobs have been linked to the administration .
more than 1100 cler@@ ks and officials are working for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now , 17 trainees have their first working day behind them .
the apprentices@@ hips at the district are apparently very sought @-@ after .
this year , some 6@@ 20 applications were recorded for awar@@ ding seats .
however , the group still lacks personnel in order to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
currently , there are still 50 un@@ occupied places in the district of M@@ ett@@ mann .
among other things , doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought .
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
according to the wishes of the parties , the administration aims to &quot; develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development . &quot;
the aim is not only to meet short @-@ term demands on skilled personnel , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented candidate shortage , it is said .
the overall concept should orient@@ ate internally and externally , highlight specific measures for lateral entran@@ ts and include a training offensive , require CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to deal with personnel problems that one did not know before .
other cities attract good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a ver@@ itable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , there is a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age .
the highest time for action , so that there are no more places to remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party .
he recently took care of a f@@ oul surprise when he publicly questioned the human resources costs and st@@ un@@ ned the rest of the parties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people want all possibilities to be checked , which enable a withdrawal from the local employers &apos; association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term , the county administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - should aim for a Hau@@ sch@@ ari@@ f , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said peoples . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the CD@@ U tries to better pay the employees and officials than it actually envis@@ ages the tari@@ ff for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are prescribed precisely at present , increases or more money only exists if you switch to a higher level that is oriented towards career years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more over the past few years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Protection Act .
last but not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , District Council Thomas Hen@@ del@@ e and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too few personnel .
Italy sharp@@ ens the tone to NGO Mig@@ rants Res@@ cue Bo@@ ots
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they must not continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister of Interior Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat of the German aid organization &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , because their team had effectively worked with yo@@ dels in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to express itself in extensive alleg@@ ations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the rescue of human life remains our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge all the accus@@ ations currently raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is assumed that its crew takes din@@ gh@@ y migrants aboard , which are supplied to them directly from traffi@@ ckers , and that the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can go off so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting occurred supposedly only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s act , whose contents were published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected to over@@ ride the authority of the Italian Co@@ ast@@ guard , the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; essential changes or obstruc@@ tions &quot; of their rescue operations .
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organization Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minn@@ iti now said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue measures in Italy had declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guards and co @-@ operation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and tri@@ als
nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berliner Wein@@ posting &quot; and two guest drivers met at Wach@@ en@@ heim in der Nord@@ pf@@ alz to enjoy Tri@@ als and places of interest for four days .
three guides were available for this purpose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the accommodation in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wach@@ en@@ heimer Tal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proved to be a good starting point for the tours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Burg@@ - und Wine Festival of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
there were view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could look far above the Pal@@ at@@ inate forest and the up@@ stream plains .
in between there were always longer asc@@ ents , rewarded for the long tri@@ als .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and to the Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st@@ markt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; again , the view point to the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flew &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the last two days many metres of altitude have been announced .
caves , rocks , towers , fort@@ resses , ruins and in@@ version huts brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed cur@@ ative br@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group had become acquainted with the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga equi@@ ps itself for E @-@ sport
will the sports stars be sitting in front of computer consoles in the future instead of hur@@ ting through wind and weather over stadium racing ?
fact : e @-@ Sport has long been a serious business , has become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tour@@ neys with high guests included .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these have also recognized the first federal government societies which are increasingly involved in this field . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg started in 2015 , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ Sport department in mid @-@ July and signed two pro@@ s for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; we hope to inspire completely new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann .
he is sure that there will be numerous clubs on this train . &quot;
next weekend , FIFA World Cup in London organis@@ es the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; in which gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven qualify .
Robin D@@ utt , too , sees great potential in the E @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football has to deal in particular with the 14 @-@ 30 @-@ year @-@ olds , so that young people can still go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian .
with prominent E @-@ athletes under contract , one could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the German flag to Asia .
what is it all about ?
in E @-@ Sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike , &quot; or the FIFA World Cup are being challenged at competitive level .
like in normal sports , le@@ agues have long since established themselves in which the pro@@ s compete against each other .
and in the Asian Games 2022 , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program .
but is it a real sport ?
for many , the idea is certainly getting used to .
also In@@ go F@@ rob@@ bing dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the German Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions which can be found in classical sport , such as increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
it also needs cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick reaction to responsi@@ veness .
professional gam@@ ers should train not only at the console but also to exercise their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ rob@@ atic also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult to perform at online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing .
the scientists highlight the high integr@@ ative effect of E @-@ sport .
the players are on the move internationally , which is like a big global family , there are no intercultural barriers .
a study by Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth of E @-@ sport .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
in three years , sales will be 130 million .
that is a little against the 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundes@@ liga .
however , e @-@ sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; writes the Del@@ o@@ itte advis@@ ors .
many countries are already on the move .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez are participating in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood Ac@@ tor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e @-@ sports bet@@ ting company Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is also a lot going on in Europe .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a teaching subject , says F@@ rob@@ atic .
in the Netherlands and France , the football @-@ premi@@ er clubs according to D@@ utt are meanwhile required to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in European comparison Germany lag behind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ chairman R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just falling into nostal@@ gia and clearing old times is no longer enough today .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but at the same time to align the company with the modern market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ zed world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t hold on to the fact that everything stays as usual with football as it always was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Car@@ ter convic@@ ted for the lyrics that Con@@ rad Roy to commit suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls for suicide .
Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months in jail behind bars and five years have been suspended on par@@ ole .
Car@@ ter was sentenced in June due to negligence by Con@@ rad Roy who took his life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his appointment .
she had been faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and eyes directed down@@ wards as she was condemned .
&quot; their actions upset Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court .
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she took no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she showed no repentance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance which they completely depl@@ ore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not figure out that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a public prosec@@ utor read a statement from Roy &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy who said that &quot; there is no day in which I do not feel the loss of my beloved son .
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try to be there for his sisters despite all my pain that we will be carrying with us for eternity . &quot;
Roy &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she would be &quot; persecuted &quot; by the knowledge that she would never take part in the marriage of her brother or be an a@@ unt for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to have this single person with whom I have been together every day since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with myself for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case appears to be a legal preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to urge others to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention after Car@@ ter &apos;s text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang on , hop on a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz told Car@@ ter &apos;s attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case by any press .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
one of the few who defended Car@@ ter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted in 2007 for murder of her British room@@ mate in Italy before being acqu@@ itted two years ago .
Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , posted a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves sympathy and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ es : learning from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ i was allowed to run as captain at the Audi Cup is not a coincidence .
FC Bayern has a big season for the European Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation does not harm .
something else was different in his seat in the cabin , that was Joshua Kim@@ i immediately , even if the additional piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made the rush to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner afterwards , after his first assignment as a Bayern captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , the console could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but Kim@@ oto was able to interpret the character of the coach .
not the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal had been chosen as a game leader in the C @-@ El@@ f , who had been com@@ promised by youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and just from the holiday .
sugar is best distributed to those you wish to keep in good spirits .
so those who have been chosen to play the heritage of L@@ ah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kim@@ es confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old worked as a mini @-@ l@@ ah@@ m over the field .
to the right rear , this is now his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did the rest .
and at all Kim@@ i worked like the one who is able to take the ru@@ dder in his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to steer the un@@ coordinated tro@@ upe .
he had a view to the whole while many others were busy with himself .
Vi@@ dal intended to re@@ play his missing fitness ( barely collap@@ sed ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus , on devil , come out of the benefits of the Asia trip ( collap@@ sed also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le with this , in their first appearance in the Bavaria jer@@ sey did not fall negative .
all this worked out well .
Sü@@ ver ran along with Kim@@ i , Ru@@ dy before the defense , both acted confi@@ dently .
the n@@ asti@@ ly occupied Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and Sü@@ ver tried a few times successfully in the construction of the game .
his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result was &quot; not as we hoped for . &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance during the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game shift , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also caught for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as unusual this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the newcom@@ ers , one looked after the game .
Ru@@ dy , for example , did not give one or two interviews in the Cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but determined six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ che said good@@ bye after a few cr@@ un@@ chy testim@@ onies at the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard an interesting phrase from Sü@@ le : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already mentioned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to win every game in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new one more .

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises bis@@ exu@@ et pace
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is shown after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V demand from a change in economic policy - and at the same time bl@@ aming the old prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Trier companies ( V@@ TU ) , states : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the desires of the economy , the Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nat@@ z sees the biggest turn@@ around in infrastructure policy : the gap between the A1 motorway between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
this year , the Ministry hopes for a planning approval process , until 2021 is expected to be building right .
the West In@@ vention of Trier , which stands in the urgent need of the federal motorway plan , also plays a role in the plans of the country .
the aim is to put the track into operation in December 2020 , says spokesperson Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
nat@@ us sees this as a sign to support regional but internationally competitive enterprises .
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) is striving for a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ Label , like von Wis@@ sing , to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of the German wine exports bag@@ ging for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , pra@@ ises the Chamber of Commerce .
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier regards an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new Master Bonus , says Managing Director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro is fores@@ een for the passed master examination and 2500 euros if graduates make themselves self @-@ sufficient within ten years of their master training .
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
according to Jan Glock@@ auer , head of the German Chamber of Commerce Trier , Jan Glock@@ auer , head of the German Chamber of Commerce , says that the planned road construction should be quick facts .
so far only 29 jobs have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to employ Wis@@ sing in the state of mobility .
the Chamber is calling for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf , vice @-@ president of the CD@@ U , refers to calculations made by the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country investing more than 20 million euros less in the maintenance of country roads in 2017 and 2018 .
in addition , Frank nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
so@@ ber@@ ing is also the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had rated grid services in an I@@ HK survey only with a score of 3.4 .
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant internet connections and break@@ downs .
former Minister for Economic Affairs , E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , is currently out of politics and still sits on the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Gre@@ ens Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where , after four months of dis@@ agreements , she cleaned up the field again .
Audi is supposed to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers see themselves faced with a counter reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi BMW announced that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
the BMW Chairman said the company believes that &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; and thus referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - forbi@@ dding or restric@@ ting diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe in order to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions regulations .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des em@@ itting diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the cost of car manufacturers to install facilities for neutr@@ alizing emissions from diesel vehicles is also increasing , making it difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of for@@ getting the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called write @-@ off devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but driven back under normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were accused of being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circum@@ vent the emissions regulations in Europe , and an inquiry concentrated on the United States has been extended .
the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could have a difficult burden on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to the win of Volkswagen .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft runs through Munich on Saturday , which has a special message .
wh@@ om@@ ever it attracts to the Is@@ ar on Saturday , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and that &apos;s not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the building department wants to clear up .
on the raft , one sees a large inf@@ low @-@ par@@ ent .
it shows a garbage mountain .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to an publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love is ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to shar@@ pen understanding for the Is@@ ar as a worthy game of wildlife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
already last summer , the raft sailed over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior .
Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll @-@ n@@ oses and the laughter against the suffering
at times Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most popular carto@@ ons dra@@ fts@@ men , the no@@ ises of his characters are his trademark .
even with 85 the Argent@@ ine@@ an is still recording and working on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ ill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist he suggested himself as a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for greeting cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , he made a breakthrough in the late 1960s : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then in &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo items ca@@ vor@@ t in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own data , he still sits on the drawing table , works daily almost ten hours .
with cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches , his funny characters continue to find much dis@@ semination worldwide .
for six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters .
the main character in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los &apos;s most popular animal in his drawings - which has a jack of thousands as a counterpart .
for the first time , his figures appear in the 3D film , which is to be projected onto the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they &apos;re saying , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
that is why he tends to rely on the TV series which , like his original drawings , is reproduced without words .
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence threatened by climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened with climate change .
la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of the conditions remin@@ ding of drought and insects that transmit diseases , which causes great head@@ aches to scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the C@@ RI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M agricultural research institute in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively je@@ op@@ ardis@@ ed because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change over the past few years , which in spring has brought much less rain and much more in autumn .
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is also a small ci@@ ch@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium , the d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ das transmit , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there is much at stake .
la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened .
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered include a better distribution of water and the slow@@ down of the evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought .
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thur@@ in@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n is celebrating its 1200 @-@ year anniversary this year .
the highlight of the festival is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival .
shop@@ keepers , guil@@ ds , traders , vag@@ ants or a detention camp should be in the city centre on these days .
the murder of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the Week@@ ly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet Wedn@@ es@@ days to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children to the office , which was the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them home .
security experts have written three words on a panel at the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies .
they ask the repor@@ ters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and abdominal feelings will suff@@ ice .
there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists suspected of being on the pay@@ roll of government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no resp@@ ite from violence , and while the bodies are accum@@ ulating throughout the country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to has taken office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are under federal protection after attacks and threats , and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year .
among the latter are their editors and their inspiration from Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder of Ja@@ vier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his many books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep , although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts , which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared themes , trauma , night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a Special Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office was established in 2010 in order to deal with the cases of journalists , it has only launched two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most of the thousands of kill@@ ings associated with drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime every year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to trial .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ comfor@@ ting and although the terrain is even more tra@@ itors .
without information about mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we mi@@ str@@ ust everybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce newspaper in the capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , presumably because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated with &quot; twelve river . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a wife and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to freely fly around in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the country &apos;s bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields , as rival fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that every day in Sin@@ alo@@ a someone or several people can be shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings who are larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; when only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , has broken the debt by not protecting his friend .
he believes two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
first of all , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Damascus Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , presum@@ ed gang@@ sters bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was not to force Val@@ dez to leave the country for his own security after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there .
in 2003 he worked as a veter@@ an repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este , when he joined five colleagues to the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the problem of intoxic@@ ants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper earned a reputation because of courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising received .
repor@@ ters loved to publish hard @-@ fitting experiments without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria Mo@@ ors Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for its reporting in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history , wherever it went .
he willingly admitted that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ I award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pu@@ vi@@ ento TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must take over the task that is to you as a journalist - either that or you &apos;re playing the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the odo@@ urs team missed Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who was able to cur@@ b like a port worker , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there at the same table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is his love for the routine his ruin ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how best to do her job and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean businesses , their secret start and landing run@@ ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things weren &apos;t allowed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
to trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it smells bad , stay away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the anger is , the editor of Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vil@@ lar@@ real said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sm@@ ell &apos;s a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the matter is happening with Ja@@ vier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other countries in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the space in which the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , suddenly no mobile phones were allowed . days earlier , Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ range area of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some repor@@ ters asked themselves whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who the governor described as un@@ trust@@ worthy .
it has been months since the repor@@ ters have gone to the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are de facto under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has put on three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former well @-@ known man , Ju@@ lio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez , in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to the state spending concentrated on the home of the governor .
and there was a group that carried out a kidn@@ apping in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , one block from the office of the prosec@@ utor .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was required when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated the political levels almost the whole century .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption .
Vil@@ lar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous incidents in this place , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped from a military attack .
just a few months earlier , readers would have considered Val@@ dez &apos;s column as the best informed source of kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we used to know what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vil@@ lar@@ real , 46 , nick@@ named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for his slender body . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources have been broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers , prot@@ esting against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists on behalf of the press .
repor@@ ter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez took a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is his .
throughout the country , journalists have become lou@@ der by writing in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on pav@@ ements and buildings .
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez goes away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying journalists and releasing them because they told the truth .
she has since asked her to be again divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surrounded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by organised crime , involved government officials and an in@@ different society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the command of politicians and security forces hiding under a blanket with organised crime .
last year , the Media W@@ äch@@ ter@@ gruppe &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; accounted for more than half of the attacks against journalists of the police and officials .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
apparently , the kill@@ ings have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as Kart@@ ell : &quot; I am here for my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones were placed next to their separate head .
some branches have voted to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava B@@ reach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the murder of its director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z public@@ ally addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page titled &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled their homeland or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who , together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City , was murdered three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , acknow@@ le@@ dges that drug traffi@@ cking frigh@@ tens him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I became a repor@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer , as suddenly all their phones were bu@@ zz@@ ing .
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with band riv@@ als and security forces near the seaside resort of Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued escal@@ ating , as promised by a number of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the cur@@ b stone edge they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on mobile phone .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens cry near - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers who kept guard to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid , they didn &apos;t show it .
under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible to the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his foot@@ steps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you only think of closing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if on the same day when Ja@@ vier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used clo@@ aking to ev@@ ade his enemies
at first glance it looks like a statue , albeit a terri@@ fying one .
researchers have now found out that the first findings of the unbelievable N@@ ash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian mountain worker were obtained so well that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well received that they could even find that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said she had had something of an &quot; troubled past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best @-@ kept din@@ osau@@ r , who has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r specimens in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier which lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the middle of the chal@@ k period .
its incredibly well @-@ preserved state has amazed scientists who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous is the best preserved fossil in its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he dig@@ ged at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine on March 21 , 2011 near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
he met something that was out of place in the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years trying to expose the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy ground @-@ mate .
after all this hard work the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you only smile a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although covered with a arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as ju@@ x@@ tap@@ osition , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed himself to ming@@ le better with his surroundings and ev@@ ade his enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million @-@ year @-@ old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has made head@@ lines in May and is now to be seen in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ en@@ ch@@ elli , according to the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to uncover it .
the amazing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
they discovered the counter sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its under@@ side .
although the counter @-@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds that of the today living animals .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ r was driven by enough pressure by eating car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution favor@@ ed the conce@@ al@@ ment of the confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the counter sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or sh@@ ing@@ les - are much smaller and vulnerable than loo@@ t , which sign@@ alizes that this no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behaviour on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es had to have been the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to examine the animal for information about his life , including his con@@ served intestinal content to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the bottom of the sea .
at this time Alber@@ ta was as warm as South Fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably far@@ ther far@@ ther inland than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin , but also retained in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as in the early cycle time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just look a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he &apos;s asleep . &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period was a time when giant ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was ch@@ ased by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons heavy monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was drow@@ ned after death in the ocean and m@@ um@@ bled in the mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he dig@@ ged at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine on March 21 , 2011 near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
according to the museum , it is the world &apos;s best ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from mu@@ zzle to hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips resting on his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were swept through the western Canada until a flooded river was floo@@ ding it into the open sea .
but the re@@ funds of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the Hau@@ cr@@ ust cover still b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured panels along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ resh@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a winning Lotto .
the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured panels that carry the skull of the animal .
his right foref@@ oot is on his side , his five fingers are spread upwards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can count the scales at his sole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in thunder@@ storms : mass ar@@ resting on A@@ 8 : many wounded
violent accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous injured , miles long St@@ aus - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) about 20 people were injured in a mass ar@@ resting on Thursday afternoon .
after the first data of the police , between the jun@@ ctions Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) were almost 30 vehicles , among them probably trucks .
at first , no data were given about the exact number of injured parties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a matter of light to moderate injuries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large bid on rescue vehicles was at the scene of the accident .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed in direction to Munich .
in the direction of travel in Munich , a ten @-@ kilometre back@@ stage was formed .
as reported by an A@@ Z repor@@ ter , there was also on the counter @-@ ride to massive obstruc@@ tions - by numerous g@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade noted the characteristics of the vehicle operators , who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive fin@@ es .
shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident took place on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : there is nothing unexpected in the train and sleeps .
or one is en@@ gros@@ sed in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ alo .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes an uns@@ af@@ e or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket inspection .
it is simply confirmed by mobile phone that you take your seat and use it to de@@ value the ticket .
a test operation is currently running on two tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the offer comes , we will expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available on many more remote routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the ticket de@@ valuation without any conductor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use them , however , some requirements have to be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - which is already the case for most passengers anyway .
you must also have purchased it via the app of the train , the DB navig@@ ator , which is anyway the most convenient type of ticket booking .
and last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like this : one gets into the train , calls his ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the test customers then show a button for the electronic de@@ valuation .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the reserved seat Y .
when the train companion arrives at the ticket inspection at Place Y , he knows that a passenger is sitting there with an already validated online ticket .
you can therefore continue to sleep , continue to work , keep silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to travel without ticket inspections by our train crew , simply check in the DB navig@@ ator itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Marketing Management Board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often travel by train knows that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket controls are among the biggest anno@@ y@@ ances .
because often you have , in any case , one of the fellow travelers does not have all the documents you need for the de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card is missing or a document that you have to show .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ d@@ ants and passenger , which leads to a bad mood in the section or large space and delays in the control of one &apos;s own ticket and the conductor will take the time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and also only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other train numbers on the same route have not yet been un@@ locked .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was shaken to its core .
only one day after she arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled over a post by someone from high school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old child and it is still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , because nobody else posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly ret@@ we@@ aned at her tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was to twe@@ eten the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed live by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretching out on the street and staying there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new to them and their community .
she placed her cell phone to return later in the evening to twe@@ ets over people on the Can@@ field Drive .
there were photos of police and people shou@@ ting , and of a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father who bore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police killed just my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman was his gun and shou@@ ted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am going to kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l to her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt ch@@ ills .
I was angry and cried . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 11@@ pm she picked up her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened over the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the subject of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from the 11th .
it is a history of survival and of the protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists in the perspective of people living in the community and filling the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel@@ l went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on with her daughter , who carried a cau@@ l@@ dron and a matching crown , the two discussed a conversation that they had &quot; over the black experience and the black state innumerable times before this morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t take it with me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a high point of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know and see it and be raised therein .
it must be well developed not only to know activ@@ ism and organization , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution , and what we need to do to free ourselves .
even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a bl@@ at@@ ant rac@@ ism , she is no different from the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp territory when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ accus@@ ation of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; my activ@@ ism was totally changed after August 9 , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association , concentrating on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organising .
it &apos;s all come . &quot;
weeks later , during an evening demonstration , Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman , Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r , wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came to Fer@@ rel@@ l : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the former co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt in@@ mates .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years following Brown &apos;s shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are presented , because I &apos;m going to be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ is &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a mes@@ si@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most open participant in the film .
as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ is &apos;s life as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , laugh@@ ing when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the de@@ human@@ ization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ ell &apos;s story repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement overall , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; and we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ mati@@ ype of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at which Fer@@ rel@@ l was selected as the heart of the film because of her identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook up this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s no coincidence , though it was at the forefront , because in a life at these jun@@ ctions as a black , gay woman stands as much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long disappeared , but the racial links between the church and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the soci@@ opoliti@@ cal atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels obliged to this memory since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have nothing to lose except our chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : TV readers to discuss about bit gallery &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bit gallery moves people , even though it is not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping mall on the southern end of the pedestrian prec@@ inct has split the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
the topic hardly leaves one cold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some say to the bit gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be real class &quot; ( Nicole Schu@@ ster ) , comes from the other side : &quot; no man needs &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) .
while the pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , from what the rest of the shops also profit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will circul@@ ate .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct marketing products offer their products .
the construction work will start at the end of the construction work .
the Gallery @-@ M@@ acher plans to integrate a market hall into the new building - Bed@@ a @-@ square with the possibility of sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sim@@ one Rooms : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been shopping in the market hall almost a week for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farm women again and again very willingly .
we also discovered the but@@ cher shop for us .
we would like that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing will settle in a market hall in the gallery will depend on the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this should not be very low for the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what is the shopping centre in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ store or supermarkets : I think that &apos;s superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are enough of them in our city .
one can see how many shop shops are vac@@ ant here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market there , it is all the more important that at least the market hall will be preserved .
after all , the product offered there is fresh , is mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive on top .
as you can see , stores in a shopping mall are only rented by larger companies , because the r@@ ents there are often not wear@@ able for a retailer .
too bad , specialty shops are almost no longer and that which is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall does not fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where should the farmers market hall go ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run if the bit gallery finally actually comes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or does it create the gh@@ ost bit gallery before selling all stores from Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that will simply not work .
and no one needs a shopping centre that is empty .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmers market instead of this gallery .
but for a farmer &apos;s market hall there is no place in Bit@@ burg thanks to the ins@@ an@@ ely many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg .
once the farmers market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are visible - white , black and brown , that almost im@@ percep@@ ti@@ bly resem@@ ble - that hang from the ceiling on cables .
the thirty portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and hair@@ cuts sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after she publi@@ ci@@ zed the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website as secret diplomatic news .
the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( a suitable simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline has united its expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ it@@ ress and ground@@ breaking dissi@@ dent , whose condem@@ nation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA extracted by Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , such as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data , a sharp , though somewhat intellectual commentary not only to the formation of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward but openly talked about identification as a woman since she was pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convic@@ ted of 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
by the prison her picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ and @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing obviously sits on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with whom she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette stu@@ b and ch@@ ewing gum by extrac@@ ting DNA from the waste to produce an image of how these people could look like .
this was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition .
she could not be photographed at that time and she could not be photographed , so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated m@@ use became an un@@ equal measure , which in the course of two years exchanged several letters .
they even created a comic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Image , &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future in which the President would convert ch@@ Ã ¢ Jud@@ gment and she would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama is actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as would be a welcome type of happy meeting .
there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , since Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender forces in order to find new twe@@ et@@ able ways to further infl@@ ame the rigid divisions that he should actually fix .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things happen for a particular reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , the basis of sex , race , sexu@@ ality , and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ th of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des following the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) how astonishing similarly , at least in organic terms , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully take with them is that our gen@@ ome does not care who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , are also to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned comic novel .
it shows Mann@@ ing how she di@@ ps with a hands @-@ free phone in the hand from the disciplinary gymn@@ as@@ tics of the United States like King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they qu@@ ell your speech , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never hold the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who sal@@ ut@@ ates Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it , then she will be greeted by the masks in the middle of the room , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ons , which inter@@ tw@@ ine like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also target @-@ oriented , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed itself with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee at Oxford University for killing
a country@@ wide human hunt is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee at Oxford University , who are looked for as susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .
on Monday for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the District Court of Cook County demonstrate .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several bites .
a common warning system published by the Chicago Police Administration says that the body was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead at the scene of the action , and det@@ ectives look at the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively searching for the susp@@ ects , officials said .
she has been a Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. cub@@ icle , the vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them was now being assessed and expelled from the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities and Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jam@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the UK police and are ready to help the U.S. investig@@ ative authorities in any conceivable way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand up .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to locate them reinforce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities are helping to find susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received an en@@ ig@@ matic hint that said something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27th .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Grand Plaza management team has published a statement to the occup@@ ants : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the victim &apos;s background and expl@@ ores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will finish the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for the re@@ inst@@ ation of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything is implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , one of the criteria listed in the list veri@@ fies that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the results of the study approved by the WA@@ DA by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren on alleged law @-@ funded dop@@ ing in the Russian sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of the matter , mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are carrying out the investigation because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programs , and we will not give something that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ ri@@ kos words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales outlet r@@ sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ nov gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the use of dop@@ ing checks in Russia as part of the D@@ oping Sk@@ and@@ als from the WA@@ DA .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the Moscow headquarters in July , WA@@ DA Director General Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli announced that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was &quot; moving in the right direction &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di doesn &apos;t sell eggs for the time being
they shared the company groups .
it was a mere precau@@ tion ; it could not be proc@@ eeded from any health impairment , it was stated in the message .
from now on , only eggs can be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been proven to have been tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ ous anti @-@ lice bites .

the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your employees at your e @-@ commerce startup , but the poll@@ s did not work .
responses were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - dec@@ eit@@ ful .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she called on people from the outside for help .
a new Human Resources Start @-@ up race is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
through the creation and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , provide special groups and demographic groups , provide employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to circum@@ vent the C @-@ suite managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T .
in addition to the snap @-@ surveys and surveys of specific teams , it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low requirements - so you can drill down why .
companies come to see that they have to remain at the top of the workplace culture so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber wrapped up in sc@@ and@@ als , since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken have been punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ LIN@@ T , this desire is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
global governance , regulation and compliance could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 according to the corporate website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent bad behavior and recognize , saw a growing interest and activity beginning this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
scent has nearly 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
U@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ cent lets companies send tailored &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surveys , collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , which enables employees to report bad behavior .
and when the main managing director is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company is found that treats its employees poorly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences from consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , Con@@ ver@@ cent has been used for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or e @-@ mail for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously .
it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees .
now , as the company Con@@ ver@@ cent uses , problems that have previously been hidden by executives in offices in cities or states - like discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair tra@@ ine@@ es@@ - can be identified and addressed faster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the Risk Management Group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment law disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to ear@@ nest ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies recognized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry going online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent provide your software as a service , and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of Venture Capital Invest@@ ors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
conver@@ gence received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising total capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itter won $ 10 million in November from B@@ ess@@ emer venture partner and brought his total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing research complex that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets like Si@@ licon Valley , high wages and interesting projects are only wag@@ ering requirements .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company , feel their voices heard and that the work you are doing is worthwhile , then they feel more oblig@@ ated to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ gence and G@@ LIN@@ T .
investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and the use of the staff , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action .
in fact , if a company asks employees after your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change doesn &apos;t come fast enough , or not at all , this can cur@@ tail dis@@ appointments and dem@@ oti@@ fy employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management firm Kot@@ ter International who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow , staff will ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Di@@ d you really hear me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate actions on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ LIN@@ T , so Er@@ ret@@ t .
and after the gathering of feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company through the speed of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , and to add a communication training to address the problems .
in the case of Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company gets new insights into its employees and hopes that in the long run this leads to better bonding of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , then you will lose companies .
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it &apos;s about 11@@ pm when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA football players conver@@ se on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some have stri@@ pped off their jer@@ sey top parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these un@@ active minutes are a lunch break .
players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final examinations after three hours of exercise before returning to the Water@@ man Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 p.m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is for the boys a real treadmill for the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer , Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday became Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three U@@ C@@ LA training sessions should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already packed schedule of the players .
the compromise gone from the two days is more than a day at which the Bru@@ ins moved the start of the camp almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as , six seasons in West@@ wood carried out practical exercises .
they are supposed to last 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the start of formal play preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said he would support N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s change of rules even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they just pushed it through , they continued to plac@@ ate , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will finish its practices once the camp is finished , which in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjoining Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class that has already been ki@@ cked with foot@@ balls that will have a safety net behind a door post , no easy task will be .
brother players are supposed to occupy the hotel this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then set up there to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces in parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
that &apos;s why I don &apos;t worry too much .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts verification in the fight against fake messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with counter@@ f@@ eit detection to fac@@ tual reviews from third parties and then display their results in the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to combat so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect potential false messages and send them to fac@@ tual reviews that may be displaying results of the fact review from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the US presidential election in 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan that social media networks should be punished if they fail to quickly eliminate h@@ asser@@ ted post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook spoke in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts @-@ review will be launched in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; in addition to the knowledge which stories of fac@@ tual audi@@ tors are challenged by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook should continue to test its feature on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; connected article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and work on other changes in its news feed to reduce false messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a Com@@ ic @-@ novel : a Castle in the History of England
in his recent past , Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970s and 1980 &apos;s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from its cozy seat in the Ir@@ ene River Valley in K@@ ent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ i@@ red Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says fal@@ sely . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to hold that letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , upcoming British artist - Isaac steering ie@@ wi@@ cz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : in 2014 he wrote &apos; Dead Man &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only responded to the thumb relief on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s his thumb impression ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell of smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself was there .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so treated with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome &apos;s greetings a little &quot; ) , this seems to be too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena pots on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ches .
he wander@@ ed through the complex and the ruins of the old castle and spoke to landscape painters , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he drank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whis@@ key &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and began to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown because the National Trust only gained full access in 2006 , when the last hei@@ ress , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the cler@@ ks just began to look after the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ cr@@ ats said , &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the period of English Emp@@ ires , maps showing who had something : &quot; you could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; Rho@@ des says , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families .
guys , let &apos;s go all the way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se in the English history on a broader base , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a rebellion which occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , Rho@@ des says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising broke out in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the two are connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ter that the Dar@@ rel@@ l family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the smu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l is portra@@ yed in the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seem to be quite a cro@@ ok , always doing debts and spending money on things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l men solved their debt crisis by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good @-@ looking boys , with a talent to wo@@ o returns . &quot;
after the end of its operation in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences
he has spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ mä@@ mä@@ ki , the site of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : more than 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle v@@ eils in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the v@@ eiling of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honne@@ f started its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau von Thursday ) .
until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team wish to keep up with Nelson Ar@@ tz &apos;s logo and the slogan .
at the end of August there will be a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers of the action have been asking for yesterday at the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they wrote on their yesterday exposed web page . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we are convinced that as a Bad Honne@@ f we know very well about the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is about more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it goes on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ inclusive promise , one that gives the city a unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , it stands in competition with other municipalities .
the city of Bad Honne@@ f pays a middle five @-@ digit amount to its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises against retirement and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first sight , a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as before , but in the minist@@ erial seat of the Prime Minister .
the five Deputy Prime Ministers , as well as the Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Minister , took part in the consultations .
thus , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in excess .
the government is dra@@ gging the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the air forces and the nav@@ y have been removed .
since the coup failed , head of state Erdo@@ gan has fired 16@@ 9 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged ties to the movement of the I@@ nex@@ il pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erdo@@ gan sees as a wi@@ re@@ pul@@ ler of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 persons who have been directly involved in the attempted put@@ sch , Ankara has been negotiating in Ankara for this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan declared the attempted coup as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gift of God &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully clean@@ se &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; discomfort in the military headquarters . &quot;
in general , there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which among other things mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the ann@@ ul@@ ment of the head@@ sc@@ arf ban for soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
the great clean@@ up of the army and the security forces goes on .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan was sent by decree another 7@@ 3@@ 95 government servants , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as though Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were formerly regarded as the actual masters of the country .
three times they put@@ ted their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan was pushing back the military power step by step , not least calling on the reform agenda of the European Union .
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan is pur@@ pos@@ efully advancing an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a particularly un@@ named officer sought asylum from persecution abroad after attempted coup attempt , the Turkish army would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if that is true , such a development could not leave NATO cold .
in any case , there is doubt in the alliance for the pur@@ ges of the Turkish army &apos;s readiness to deploy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say NATO diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the Green Card rules , President Donald Tr@@ ump said , cited by the media .
he envis@@ ages lowering legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules on obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by changing the way citizens from other countries will be issued green cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate track for rac@@ ec@@ ar shuttle
over and over again over the past few months , the future of the ticket sh@@ utt@@ les has been cont@@ ested - now it is supposed to go very fast .
at the end of the year , at the ailing track , on which the tourist train runs , is to be built .
according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work on the track is to begin in the long run in order to secure the future of the racing platform shuttle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to continue ordering and renov@@ ating the Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g route , the country is committed to this particularly important connection for tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Deputy Secretary of State Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he reduced the costs for the repair of the track to around 2.5 million euros .
this sum represents 75 percent of the country .
the contract , on which the shuttle will also be ordered from the country in the future , will be finally agreed , stated S@@ üh@@ l .
the ministry and the South Thur@@ in@@ gia rail as operators are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are tra@@ ded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years .
this is the reason why the shuttle shuttle will be ordered regular on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a popular rail link between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
over the past few months , it has been tested in the course of a pilot operation , whether the route is used by a large number of people to order it regularly in the future .
the track is also partly strong in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
just when you thought that 2017 couldn &apos;t be even more crazy , a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming .
yes indeed .
sex robots are currently a big deal .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Emer@@ itus Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and Co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start taking her ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
&quot; people make fun of it , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more often , &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey when he published his new report .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions , which are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; customize &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything from the ey@@ ec@@ row of the robot over the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it becomes even more disturbing since many robots possess the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman look progres@@ sively .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot , for example , enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ end@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ Plus Gold has a personality that is as good as possible to your personality , &quot; enth@@ uses True Compan@@ ion &apos;s website .
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day it also has its m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , be fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female properties , the all@@ u@@ sions to rape , when one goes one step to Fri@@ gi@@ d ( meaning here : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah , trouble one the most .
on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy beha@@ ved with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the website .
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just a different sex toy .
their formation and increasing sophisti@@ cation point to something dark and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .
most men , of course , will not hold any sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notes its increasing popularity , they nevertheless remain at the edge of consumer culture .
but what se@@ eps out of the boundary zones can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots emerge in a time when women &apos;s rights are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted women to be sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted .
the most dis@@ ap@@ pointing aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the intri@@ cate body and the st@@ unted eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap .
the aim behind these sex robots is to create a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as real@@ istically as technically possible ( although with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their gro@@ wers want them to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots are no real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no mediation or background history , nothing that indicates independence or anything that might distur@@ b the fantasy of total submission .
in other words , they are pleasing slaves .
or to express it in the language of 2017 : maid
Tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human mind
it has become a tru@@ ism of the Tr@@ ump era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized American elec@@ torate have also split families in small formats .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving Day , there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ choosing relatives .
we all pur@@ port@@ edly strain ourselves to burst our filter bags .
less noticed is the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps to bring families together .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lef@@ tist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone she knows , including the repub@@ li@@ can relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics , is suddenly and quite strange on the same side .
around the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it is in a further context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the dis@@ figur@@ ing effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that one day his bi@@ bs will no longer rep@@ el us .
however , there is an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alize , &quot; which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards .
I find myself falling from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ com@@ ical version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both compared to Tr@@ ump in fact seem to be a very mild off@@ ence .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans will only be spiritually healthy to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the biggest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York car park , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need a caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are qu@@ ain@@ t and the animals twist in order to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the per@@ pen@@ di@@ cular music con@@ veys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city is not just the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cot@@ tage is in fact not a Swiss cottage - the topic @-@ pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage does not count - but a large round@@ about in the north of London .
the central park car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magic experience , as here two two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ ties can go on it and have all a great time .
if I could have evaluated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required .
the poor woman in the department store was inde@@ struc@@ tible , while I tired the experience of submitting my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred to hospital with chest pain
Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for the second time .
last year , he was hospit@@ alized due to the treatment of cuts on his w@@ ri@@ sts , which he re@@ port@@ edly suffered from prison authorities in one case in his cell .
because of murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 by firing her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he had his girlfriend for a noc@@ tur@@ nal intru@@ der that hid himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal this time to the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say they are too len@@ i@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Court of Justice said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection may be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ door @-@ wat@@ chers from F@@ oot and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were dischar@@ ged into the holidays and to the secondary schools .
three of the students will attend high school , four at the secondary school .
school director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte greeted the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen on Tuesday evening .
the 29 students of the four classes , led by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , elected a young eag@@ les growing up in the poultry farm , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the lower band introduced a musical titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Der Adler in chicken erhof &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg and bred it from his chi@@ ckens .
instead of a chicken &apos;s k@@ ew , a small eagle came out .
but the hope to make a chicken from him fell , the eagle spread out on a high mountain and s@@ wore his wings .
after that the classes showed three and four in the studio of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens danced with the young go@@ dd@@ les , the cylinders carried to the bet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Eagle stands for integration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said school director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the kit@@ ten is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
she wished each quarter @-@ wat@@ cher to feel accepted in his new school .
this was followed by a thank @-@ word to the colleagues , the former school director Michael Müller , who always jumps in with instruc@@ tional pas@@ sports , and the parents &quot; representatives .
the Ken@@ yan period is over , class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher explained .
after two years of teaching , they were very reluct@@ ant to leave their students , because it had been a really great time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , they can rely on the four @-@ wat@@ ery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to conclude , all students left a song of summer and holiday time .
there was great joy with the children .
eight first @-@ class consoles have already been registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were det@@ ained for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television , announced .
on the morning of 1 August , a group of illegal refugees were arrested by the police in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released while an investigation is underway .
the State Department told B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek authorities have exac@@ erb@@ ated the control of the free camp and impose significant fin@@ es on anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose . &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the Court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what those affected now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the action ?
an overview of the most important questions and answers .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.@@ 3 million cars .
the aim is to improve the emission characteristics of cars in emissions categories Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from this .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin from the ACE Automobile Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously apply only to vehicles that have Schumann software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has ordered the Kraft@@ fahrt ( KBA ) office .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the manufacturers have announced swift implementation in the coming months , but still do not call an exact date . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler has announced that it is necessary to address each affected person .
if an inspection is due anyway , it will be carried out in its framework .
how long will the conver@@ sions go altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
this depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as we have seen , the car manufacturers do not voluntarily act on the subject of the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
it could be time @-@ consuming to make an appointment .
what do drivers do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ?
the ACE advises you to wait .
presumably foreign manufacturers would reti@@ re , according to S@@ met@@ anin .
is a massive price fall of Euro @-@ 4 cars now threatened ?
the ACE is afraid of that .
but in the regions where driving b@@ ans thre@@ aten .
so far , there is no loss of value for older diesel in rural areas .
the ACE advises to wait for sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to be political .
one of the prize winners does not want to come - in protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) receives as the first ra@@ pper one of the cov@@ eted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center .
as the cultural facility announced on Thursday , this year also singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the scholars .
the awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .
traditionally US President Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and join with his wife Mel@@ ania at the award ceremony .
the award @-@ winning Le@@ ar award , announced by progressive television series , has already announced that it will not be possible to participate in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presi@@ dency has decided to neg@@ lect the arts and human rights - even to depri@@ ve them of the means - and that burdens me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to make clear their views .
the Kennedy Center , named after the former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural facility in the US capital .
former prize winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will reti@@ re next year .
the place is already written out - but suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker has been City Buil@@ der for the past 31 years .
and the work is still a lot of fun for him , as he teaches in the press conference .
he reports about varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , it is surprising that no application has ever fulfilled the requirements profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
thus - taking notice of the regular notice periods - shall be enough time for a famili@@ ar@@ isation .
since Has@@ lach acts as a lower building law authority for the administrative community , the applicant has to show relevant degrees .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if they could no longer fill them out , then the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice .
but the proximity to the citizens is important to the city and to him , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate and good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years in ministry some important projects have accumulated , looking back at the h@@ ack@@ ers with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city li@@ vable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the building office and its staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , diverse projects are on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen station .
the bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , and the stadium renovation is still a topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter alone will book with around € 1.5 million , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my success@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
design is available for a city builder with great le@@ e@@ way .
with his own yard and gar@@ dener &apos;s yard , a lot of things can be quite flexible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the old town as an ensemble is listed as an ensemble , it is important to &quot; have an eye on what fits in &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going city architect emphasizes .
anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has a high level of responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is the builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything is running over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can count on many years of employee support and coordination : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been doing so for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been working for 15 years .
also , that his successor stays for a long time , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place . &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city .
those who want to bury Roland W@@ acker should , according to information from the city of Has@@ lach , have a completed academic degree as a diploma engineer or Bachelor with speci@@ alization in architecture and have good knowledge in the areas of building planning and building planning law .
the municipal building department is subject to civil engineering , civil engineering , civil engineering , urban property management , municipal depot and municipal gardening as well as the lower construction law office , including monument protection .
bike thrown on lines : rail track closed
according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bike on the lines of the railway track in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) .
these were so heavily damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and have been looking for them since the night hours .
near the scene of the crime a sho@@ oter sco@@ oter and a bike driver were observed by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ anno@@ is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch as AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ators , or the perpetr@@ ators , were at risk of themselves and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the train transport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the facility , as well as the delay and the costs for rail @-@ replacement transport , sponsors of the railway customers could also come to the perpetr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum would be expected , the spokes@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the southern railway track could be led without obstruc@@ tions .
just under ten passenger trains were on Friday morning , two of them were watching the long distance .
freight trains did not fall out , but they had delay .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch some 200 meters of overhead cables had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meats and chocolate may sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the incur@@ able condition affecting about 1.3 million in the United States and 300@@ ,000 in Great Britain causes stomach cra@@ mps and blo@@ ating , recurring or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , weight loss and extreme ti@@ redness .
while suffer@@ ers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products in order to relieve their symptoms , researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine .
the leading researcher , Dr Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells are pat@@ rolling in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes hiding in the food do not enter the body .
cells that are able to trigger inflammation are ev@@ ened by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
if the equilibrium leads too far towards inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
in experiments it was found that a kind of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a specific bacter@@ ium in its intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - in order to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacteria species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet toler@@ ant to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han , more toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ mi@@ lie@@ us , if the same system is also beneficial in humans .
the post@@ doctoral student Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan was investigating a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance , when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same stem that had not been separated .
it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bial growth of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced in DNA and six species of bacteria were found , which were present in mice with immune cells , but were missing in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment , so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was absent and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the Gen@@ ev@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria were working on the immune system , the researchers led Gen@@ reu@@ ter@@ i to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to im@@ mature immune cells isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied out of the liquid , it turned out to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as an inhibit@@ ory 3 lac@@ tic acid .
when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the mice &apos;s food , the number of cells increased by around 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han levels were hal@@ ved , the number of cells fell by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same tolerance @-@ promoting cells as mice , and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially , high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han levels can lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
Manchester United signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria .
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday , and impressed in the pen role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will .
however , the blues had been eliminated from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and made only 45 minutes what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho ad@@ mits he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready earlier than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va Stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this week , the Independent disclosed that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted three more new commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already done a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fantastic job &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to meet three of its four priority new commitments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have taken great trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; painted &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in Mich@@ ig@@ an in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
the radar screen was the form of a Dream@@ liner .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such commerci@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new depth stop for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turned , when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD boss , social @-@ demo@@ crat prime ministers always looked for Berlin with a certain concern before elections .
there was no fire from the party headquarters , but no head@@ wind from the Con@@ federation - that was the most important wish of the election fighters .
since Martin Schulz has led the party , this has fundamentally changed .
since then , the staff of Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus , with a growing horror , are watching events in the SPD @-@ governed provincial capitals .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with head@@ winds .
there were deep stops .
one by one .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against the coalition of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows once again : red @-@ green can simply not go@@ vern reliably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber , Germany &apos;s editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surprising fraction of a Gre@@ ens parliam@@ ent@@ arians over@@ threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the Parliament election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from the CD@@ U and the F@@ DP .
the Green Federal Executive Director Michael Kell@@ ner called on the back@@ sliding Dutch Green Party El@@ ke T@@ westen to return her mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear distortion of the choice of voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen must return her mandate immediately , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal President and Elec@@ toral Committee of the Green Party to the German Editor Network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD vot@@ er si@@ ghs when the new job of the party reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the CD@@ U without his own government majority following the over@@ step of the green dep@@ u@@ ties of El@@ ke T@@ westen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the temporary highlight of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD national associations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and no one knows what &apos;s next .
the misery began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , more not , the comrades reli@@ eved at that time .
after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
it was then - and everything got much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into a swing , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te swept the party smoothly .
the comrades were lab@@ ori@@ ously ra@@ pping in the weeks afterwards .
then , when they had just picked up new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit from Hamburg came .
and with him came the next fall .
mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD deputy , lost his ni@@ mb@@ us that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because in crisis communication it did everything wrong , what one can do wrong .
since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for its political survival .
so now Stephan Wei@@ l .
due to the VW @-@ fun@@ er@@ als and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony had already been critic@@ ised for a long time .
the survey values were added .
despite this , or perhaps precisely because of this , Wei@@ l increasingly sought to acc@@ ede to the federal government over the past few weeks .
the ambi@@ tions of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin did not remain hidden in the context of Martin Schulz .
they let him be granted because they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party .
now the exact opposite could happen .
in doing so , Wei@@ l is not guilty of the party @-@ internal purpose of the Lower Saxony region .
and Schulz does not at all .
in the meantime , comrades try to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed at the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the back@@ sliding Par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians T@@ ests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is int@@ ol@@ erable and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ westen put their own car@@ eers over the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ westen had not been elected as a direct candidate , but on the country list of the Green Party in Lower Saxony , the Lower Saxony deputy continued .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compla@@ ins of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters &apos; wil@@ le four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l as prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the SPD in Lower Saxony as the leading candidate for the German elections to the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career prospects of future CD@@ U parliam@@ ent@@ arians will fal@@ si@@ fy the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for the clari@@ fication of the background .
I want to know if there has been more or given further commitments from the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
subsi@@ dy money for center nucle@@ us III
those who want to rehabil@@ itate his home in the years can soon get support from the country .
on Wednesday , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives informed city development on Wednesday in sens@@ ations .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler gave a review of what has happened so far .
since 1991 there have been san@@ itation areas .
back then , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , previous san@@ itations are a &quot; achievement project &quot; - it is finally important to promote interior development and not only to open up new construction areas .
on April 4 , I received the information from Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Karlsruhe that there will be a rehabilitation area III .
the funding amount amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which 500 000 Euros are coming from the country , the rest of the municipality &apos;s sens@@ ations .
how is a renovation area created ?
one will continue to investigate , as Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
it also plays a role whether there is any interest in the planned area to rehabil@@ itate .
if necessary , the area boundaries could then be postpon@@ ed again .
the bridge represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal state program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which the restructuring would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , i.e. per plot , carried out .
the renovation area would then finally be set as a statute .
the licensing period for the funding has been ongoing since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
until September of this year , however , the stock@@ taking will only be carried out , within the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire .
in November or December the statute review should be carried out as far as possible so that the renovation can begin next year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently declared that each commune had to carry out the forec@@ asted cau@@ tions .
the aim is to evaluate and decide the urban conditions and to decide when to renov@@ ate and to what extent .
there will be a commemor@@ ative note in the land register for the respective property .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come back to sens@@ ations myself and get a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel stressed that the project was a key success factor for the project .
therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires that will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out by the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which it is about the structural condition and the remedi@@ ation views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and residential building &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; information about the size , parti@@ tioning and residents of a residential area can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; business sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be filled out if business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , to be aware , Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionnaire was not at the same time an application for funding .
furthermore , new building measures are not eligible for funding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler also emphasized that the distribution of funding according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - whoever comes first , first grin@@ ds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could not make &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reserve funds for later &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local nucle@@ us II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or uses a micro@@ chip to come home and car with a hand movement
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to the medical standard .
the technology resembles a cat and dog im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am wants to change the locks on houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for an additional cost of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now incorporated both at home and his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost tax@@ pa@@ yers thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a nav@@ al helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month will cost tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military figures left to TI@@ ME Magazine , up to $ 24@@ ,000 .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all over the world .
the helicopter , manufactured in Connec@@ ti@@ cut , was on display next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire engine from Wis@@ con@@ sin and a truck from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House Military Bureau required the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or cargo , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superior , the deputy commander of the aviation .
the message indicated that the helicopter arrived on the South La@@ wn on 17 July at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning and so long until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 o &apos;clock in the evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed , a second crew would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of the service hours .
the original flight crew was in the helicopter during the event , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the flight .
from the records provided by TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could hurt its destination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the command@@ ant .
&quot; sounds like you &apos;re locked up , &quot; answered the deputy commander .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and not covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but even official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an impetus for the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft , known as a Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but to demand their use only for a photo op is unusual .
Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation in February when the presidential jet was in front of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , Taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of reports compla@@ ining about the use of the presidential jet through its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is thrilled by the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 countries produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deputy Secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently perform training flights in the area around Washington and in the South La@@ wn to susp@@ end the US President at the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 carried out 58 exercise landscapes in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted during the training needs of the flight crew for the month , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said an official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; helicopter units also flew 11 hours a day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers over@@ took the burden of none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said the company had not been involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget@@ ary awards for the presi@@ dency flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ ats of the US Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour .
the unit records the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Navy Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers on the basis of estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual budget . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a 2015 RA@@ ND study , Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rates do not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract completion .
at that time , the former press spokesperson of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things that are produced in America this week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
it is of course appropriate to highlight this . &quot;
it was not clear if Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine car .
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss before kne@@ eling task
the championship leader of the second Tennis Bundes@@ liga starts at the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
the TC Blue @-@ Weiss N@@ uss will kick off tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Kiel , the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
despite the five games still flaw@@ less , the runner @-@ up of the Second Tennis League has given itself the sense of reality .
team principal Mari@@ us Z@@ ay at any rate has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially on the back positions I find the team very good . &quot;
imports from the high North aim mainly for class and stability at the S@@ V .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Danish and Finn@@ s can even refer to operations in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay , looking at Har@@ ri Heli@@ ova ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ swi@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be hard for us as always . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump was not really happy when he put his signature under the law to tigh@@ ten sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his hurry to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress has packaged a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he estimated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ amed the US offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft intends to punish European companies which help the Russians build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors from O@@ MV , which co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Project Nord Stream 2 together with other European companies , have been dis@@ qui@@ eted since then .
the dr@@ one scene is enormous .
however , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump should even impose the sanctions on an executive order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has looked at which the Group could resist and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;

scroll backwards : the city provides 46 kitchen aid
the city itself organizes the K@@ ita @-@ lunch table itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the city &apos;s day care centers , the clock is turned back .
on 1 September the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the municipal kinder@@ garten facilities ( Kit@@ as ) in its own homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz , Deputy Head of the Youth Services department , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooking is still out of the house : a cat@@ erer manages this task and supplies freshly cooked co@@ ols .
the town runs 46 day nur@@ series in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunch@@ time .
last year &apos;s kit@@ esur@@ fing year 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are cared for 45 hours of the week eat lunch in the K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid for 35 @-@ hour care when children remain until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time employees have kitchen service from 1 September : they warm up the delivered food , supplement them with salad , raw vegetables and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individually , give the food off , clean and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are permanently assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz .
the size - there are two groups as well as si@@ eving arrangements - determines the scope of the ho@@ ur@@ ly range .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen workers are now part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the management to implement educational concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is what it is all about : healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a known force in the ita , a person familiar to them , and not always changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
cleaning the K@@ ita rooms - up to now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides improving the quality of the kitchen also has the charm that it has shown in the cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign lending for the city as the most economical way , it is from the press office .
and that , although 46 partial @-@ time powers are re @-@ set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so heavy with around 750 persons in the education sector , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says the UN

Nicholas Hay@@ som , acting head of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women are chann@@ elled in the provinces . three women candidate for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credi@@ ble when women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
the Tali@@ ban has published threats against a choice process that coinci@@ des with the transition of international combat actions to an advisory role .
this year the elections for the first time will hand over power peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next .
Hay@@ on said that a strong role for women will intensi@@ fy the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Afgh@@ an Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of 3,@@ 6 million registered voters .

according to the police , the men talked to the 13 @-@ year @-@ old , who stayed with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße , at 14.@@ 55 hrs , because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s mobile phone .

G@@ MB concern about investment in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glas@@ gow
a trade union wants to verify the long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glas@@ gow by managers of the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company kept silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the factory , which produces hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea bis@@ cuits in addition to other products .
Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s owner , Pla@@ dis , said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the manager of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s claim that funding for the modernis@@ ation of production lines is not being pushed forward . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ Organis@@ ator Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , is deeply concerned with our members .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers focus strongly on the local community and the greater Glas@@ gow region , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic decline of production , the eastern end of Glas@@ gow is urgently needed a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the branch leader at T@@ oll@@ cross yesterday received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to it as we value the ongoing commitment among employees and trade union representatives .
two months ago we had a regular meeting with co @-@ workers and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross where some questions were discussed openly .
we discussed with the employees that like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we continually review our business - and that applies to all our business units and locations - in order to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross location , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we recognise the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site fully and fully . if our operations change at the site , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to learn this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona be warned three years ago from N@@ ey@@ mar ?
La Liga &apos;s site may regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not leave in its persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar after issuing a £ 18@@ 9 million offer to trigger its release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years before the world murder ?
the sensational base heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record more than twice the current brand , whereby Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds .
after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional ath@@ lete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP a week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a spring near the Catal@@ ans board insi@@ sts that the club has always tried his best to take care of him since he arrived from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world three years ago warned by the PS@@ G president ahead of this prospect ?
when Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strong warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players with them , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .

on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um was travelling with his VW at 19.@@ 55 hrs on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in the direction of Le@@ ese .
in the area of the local area of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a car came to meet him in his lane , so that he had to escape to the right .

&quot; &quot; &quot; interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atz report reli@@ eves Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report on the abuse @-@ cases reli@@ eves Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; Wir sind Kirche , &quot; explained after publication in front of the German press agency , he expected from the former Regensburg bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ eri@@ ct Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology .
it would very much serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their false app@@ rais@@ al of the processes at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; double standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were measured in reporting on violence in the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doub@@ ted that &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds &quot; would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation &quot; was striking , &quot; says the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ lett , Histori@@ an and Member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of describing the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep this for normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ l@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk , Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we would like to go to the church and this is a prisoner of interest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , she pointed out that in her youth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put@@ ts have been a very normal educational tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cope with bold children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they found it unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to past decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with reports about abuse of abuse pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
completely wrong@@ ly , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who auth@@ ored the memory band &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s protection , &quot; says Hes@@ sian , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with it , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report .
what exactly is in the 440 pages report that the lawyer Ulrich Weber commissioned with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment , commissioned by the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg ?
in a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen was sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that , in many cases , cath@@ et@@ als of physical and psychological violence were used by the master @-@ master R. .
especially in the case of high emotion@@ ality , punishment for the students was even more intense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , contrary to numerous other defend@@ ants , many victims considered the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even had positive memories with him despite violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen station Georg R@@ atz@@ inger explains in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incidents of Viol@@ ence Ex@@ erc@@ ise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; is a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , many pupils stand out for their &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears as a ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ cian and perfec@@ tion@@ ist who became pal@@ p@@ able by the Ö@@ f@@ teren when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz brought no top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is common in it .
he has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
even the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school took place outside of its sphere of influence .
at best , one can submit to him , to experience it too late or to have taken early indications of not being taken seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um on which he worked was perceived by virtually all inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the vast majority of his students , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , presented an excellent testimony , describing him as &quot; warm @-@ hearted , &quot; &quot; popular , &quot; &quot; honest , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compla@@ ins of its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotional appeal , which also led to out@@ breaks of rage .
the fact that he was not only popping up with chairs and throwing the key ring on the floor , but also distributing ear @-@ cow@@ ards and drew too nau@@ ghty boys on the hair or ears , he himself admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able period , the 1960s and 1970s , in parents and teachers .
do you still know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state school .
compared to what it actually is about in this report , namely the app@@ alling sexual abuse and the violent exc@@ esses at the pre @-@ school , this is true of Bag@@ at@@ ella .
one wonders whether it has to do with his famili@@ arity and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just rush@@ ed on him .
many people who have never understood him are still eag@@ erly working on the Bavarian pop@@ e .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in connection with the report a lot about the abuse of the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen was reported in the media .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger mentioned in the final report also some involvement or complic@@ ity in regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael hes@@ emann : no , no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claims to have been entrusted to the master of the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were dedicated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the afflicted on behalf of the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in the education of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most of the victims are silent .
if they did not even entr@@ ust themselves to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir leader , who , in some cases , would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators .
how do R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
Michael hes@@ emann says : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I don &apos;t see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have had timely re@@ aliz@@ ations and could have stopped the perpetr@@ ator .
I think it ... also for really absurd to assume that it is equivalent to him ... to be more urgent or more clear or more open than to her parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , confi@@ dant teachers etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is how the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the students and / or their surroundings affected him in the run @-@ up could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus acqu@@ itted of any complic@@ ity .
so he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to the ad .
therefore , there is no reason to associate its good name with these atro@@ cious crimes , as it happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violent exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was to be read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former cathedral @-@ master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking away &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this reproach ?
Michael hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that everything was mixed up and mixed into a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and abuse of violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that is exactly what is a mis@@ use of the report .
there is , namely , clean@@ ly separated : between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the high school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence , we once again say other alleg@@ ations .
in addition , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , thus also for four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the ch@@ oral director of the Cathedral @-@ cats .
the whole aw@@ ful test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which the boys were regularly har@@ assed by sa@@ di@@ stic teachers and suffered terri@@ bly , all took place at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions had to prevail .
but with those , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister had nothing to do with Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because he got the boys to face when they were already on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on that , like most witnesses pointed out , the subject &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mary School &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; t@@ abo@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what was different on the gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael hes@@ emann : indeed , there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many sacrifices have appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in numerous cases , despite violence , can even combine positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so at most it remains the reproach to have looked away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he just started to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was just not working and responsible , ( as the witness ) did not want to hear , and then again around 1993 .
was Georg R@@ atz@@ inger spar@@ ed his ears in front of the states ?
Michael hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 , he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the pres@@ ch@@ ool it will continue to practice the punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the face of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .
this , of course , was at a time when legal clarity had long been banned in Bavaria .
before that they took place in a legal grey @-@ zone , as each of us knows still white .
it was difficult for him to assess where the affected people might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed , and where the ad@@ missible limit was actually exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he has always looked away .
that &apos;s just not true .
only in 1980 the examination of schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis maintained that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards to that time .
how do you see it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael hes@@ emann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we historians are talking about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pit@@ fall of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. the danger of judging the past according to modern moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess is right .
but this , of course , does not apply to sexual abuse , which at all times was ab@@ hor@@ rent and also not for what was f@@ aded in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , which goes far beyond that at that time .
that &apos;s all terrible and I &apos;m glad that it &apos;s finally being worked up .
but at the same time I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s protection , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing , that is to say ear@@ ne@@ sts and ears and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then forbidden , it also kept strictly adher@@ ing to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; which picture of his time in Regensburg asked Georg R@@ atz@@ inger for the interview with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
was the subject of testing also a language ?
Michael hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells us from his perspective that the Cathedral spar@@ rows played only a minor role .
in spite of this , I did not deny that he had a strict regi@@ ment there .
but even this has to be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demands of unconditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world @-@ class , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y alone , the un@@ ru@@ ly boys don &apos;t even make big singers and before each success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of people did you experience as Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks with her book ?
Michael hes@@ emann : through the work in the book and beyond that , I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and experienced again and again as wonderful , humor@@ ous , basic , deeply believing and heart @-@ good people , from which one can not imagine that he could only do something on a fly .
I regularly get in touch with him , like many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , 23 years after his posting , visit him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family .
those who did not forgive him until now , that he was once strict to them , are therefore clearly in the minority .
most of them are thank@@ ful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them the world of music to them .
and that he always was a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , sure that it may be - but also a lovely dis@@ respect , to which they still look up today and which they almost ven@@ er@@ ate .
and please , once more clearly : all that is presented to him are educational methods which at that time were on the order of the day .
we can be glad that we have long since overcome this time .
but it is most un@@ just to make a man , just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to become a media sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
the evil intent behind it is all too obvious .
for the report , which has just been published , reli@@ eves him .
now the attack would stop , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has gotten himself great mer@@ its and without those outside Bavaria and perhaps still Germany nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
