<seg id="1">Munich, 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irish institution, where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A crypt chapel, where it is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners cultivate the former soil of peasants.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich encourages exciting stories.</seg>
<seg id="6">It annoys when maps are not up to date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this, which had to be very exciting, because the car navigation system, instead of a bypass road, showed a green meadow.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria Atlases, an offer of the Bavarian State Government, are anything but up-to-date - but that's why it is very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how towns and communities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Mercury since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a flickering carpet that is not recognized as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">Detailed maps, so-called urgency sheets, were incorporated into the large map of the map for towns and villages.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were based on data from the Bavarian surveyor between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic survey of Bavaria for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops were finally deducted from Lunéville's peace of 9 February 1801: it was the present-day neighbours who created the idea of an area-wide Bayern District.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Elector Max IV. Joseph drove the project forward, set up the" "" "Topographical Bureau" "" "- and therewith the Bavarian surveyor." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The position sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all others on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison between former and present is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded 21 years after the map, i.e. 1877, as a Munich suburb.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstrasse, which was first named after George Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in a smaller map appears with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-written numbered flutes from the so-called "original recording" from which the base tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">Small parcels now no longer occupy farmers, but small farmers in the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the location of the Oktoberfest, was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert in the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other hand of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the area of the present district of Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name "at the Gasteig" or the height "lying on the air" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one once locked people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">In 1858 / 59 the Munich district-asylum "Auf der Auer Lüften" was born there in 1858 / 59.</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - the psychiatrist who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and, for example, ended the chain of so-called Irren." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he prohibited the staff from using violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients, first place had been, and later it was extended to 500 seats.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the "Kreisirrenanstalt" in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, has been there since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people in Munich's Salesianum meet at the site of the former auric institution.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">To the west lies the football field of the TSV Munich East, east of residential houses from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the children's house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was built - in architectural reference to the original building of the asylum, which was destroyed during the Second World War with bomb attacks." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed as" "" "Main Square" "" "around 1856, the Kaufinger street was called" Kaufinger Gasse. "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allied bombs broke many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages were once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line-trip takes place.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Citizen's Rights group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Fares issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the State.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls for Afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention when travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, racial-based incidents occur recently throughout the state and can be noted here," said the Group's opinion.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted Missouri law, which makes it more difficult for people to capture discrimination complaints, as well as the state's law enforcement agencies that disproportionately focus on minorities, prompted the group to issue warnings, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "you have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are halted or killed because of their skin color, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the US.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents such as racist crime against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more fuel during the trip through the state and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points out a recent report by the Missouri General Secretary-General Bureau, which shows that black motorists in the state are being stopped 75 percent more frequently than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be ready to bring any deposit money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the newest facts from the Hassan Crime Reports program of the FBI, which classify the state with regard to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law, which would make it more difficult to sue a company because of housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Prior to that, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States had passed immigration laws to arrest the local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which will contribute to further race benefits according to the ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">"" "the" "" "Fischbacher Weidewitn" "" "project is a successful project and will continue next year." ""</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU members of the Bundestag, Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac, presented an image on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the CDU-village association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies at the legland court of the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann granted insight into his company, in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many kittens are provided and accommodated in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">For him, "Schwarzwaldmilch," for him, is the alternative marketable way for the milk of his cows, "says Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "as he is also BLHV Chairman of Fisherbach, he called the" "" "elementary importance" "" "the" "" "turnkey project" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "I cannot generate profitably on such steep surfaces." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area care for a lot of work, much must be processed with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," "" "stressed Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical pesticides and fertilizers, even if he did not conduct bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">For mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "the Commune has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader funding."</seg>
<seg id="80">At a cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the afforestation of the land could be dragged out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how to keep their business going," "" "said the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Because of subsidies, farmers often stand in criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 parcels were fenced by eleven participants.</seg>
<seg id="85">The area of disclosure is 40 hectares, which must not be afforested until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total costs of 71 500 euros, half of the leaders were promoted, a quarter was part of the municipality of Fisherbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "the great advantage is the long service life of the fences," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you are doing a really good job without farmers and farmers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">Peter White also stated: "the best foods are produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Conservation Guideline (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state-run promotion of pasture fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.</seg>
<seg id="93">The precondition is the presence of a conveying backdrop referred to by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">Moreover, the fencing area must not be minpperable (inclination above 35 per cent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the 2018 fisher-starter project the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build a fence of just under 16 kilometres, is currently underway.</seg>
<seg id="96">The disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred anymore?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta from CNN on the President's proposals for drastic restrictions on legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and liberty impersonators would have liked him if he had done so.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he grabbed its significance, and in particular the importance that it was attributed to, as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta insisted: "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is properly correct, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, and your afflicted people who desire to breathe freely, and the poor fall of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable waste" "" "on our screens was better to see." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not involved in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trumps USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words on the base after their death - knew very well that they took up a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out, classical depiction.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And exactly as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from right wing wanted to change this for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone but rather an early neo-conservatism that brings the American flame to the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch is not supposed to illuminate the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Rather unusual, Limbaugh came across something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative action of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausting, miserable but hopeful people after long and often horrific trips on the deck of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue tells them the words of hope and the welcome they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever like to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch shall not light the way, but ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scotsmen belonged to the British team.</seg>

<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it's absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchers, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m stretch, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Their captain's speech was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">"" "the passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in were great." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth Silver medal winner, who will compete in the 400 m hurdles at their fifth World Championships, says that it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scotsmen are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best overall number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-distance runner Muir leads along this road and last year set five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">She will participate in the 1.500 m and the 5.000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch for a great season with the British Team Trials and Anniversary games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world cup as the only other Scotsman was in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain states that they are "enormously proud" of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases they will also be involved in medals and finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a big honor anyway, but knowing that my teammate had voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb on podiums.</seg>
<seg id="155">As for my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world cup.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to get this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion again.</seg>

<seg id="160">Blocking of Critics on Facebook: do not worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the preheating of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something bad.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the papers struck him for everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He knocked at the critique, sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "because in 1783 Washington said," "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute, we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And that's why the American Civil Liberties Union sued him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "" "" "it's only Facebook," "" "said many people." ""</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary hoax head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict observance of the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very clever to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to play his hairless head for chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of people coming to the Governor's side - which is a public forum called official and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too simple to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people swinging online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only true people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.</seg>

<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>

<seg id="408">Less than 1 per cent claimed to have discovered that they had accidentally travelled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.</seg>
<seg id="409">The survey carried out at more than 1,000 people, carried out by a jet-charter service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also noted that younger travellers rather disregard the rules.</seg>
<seg id="410">Of those surveyed admitted that they have knowingly tried to fly with something prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 percent of millennials, compared to less than 15 percent, were the members of Generation X.</seg>
<seg id="411">The most common items that were purposely passed by TSA agents were food and fluids.</seg>
<seg id="412">More than 3 percent said to have knowingly carried objects with blades by security control, while 2.2 percent of the female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male interviewees also confirmed that they had deliberately brought illegal drugs into the aircraft.</seg>

<seg id="421">Electro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk happily shares with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3."</seg>
<seg id="422">In doing so, he has so far undermined that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.</seg>
<seg id="423">In addition to the ever triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has for the first time reveal a different, less brilliant figure on the announcement of the latest quarterly balance: the number of cancellations made with the new mass market model 3.</seg>
<seg id="424">In the past few months, Musk has often hired more than 500,000 orders for the new car, whose delivery is just starting.</seg>
<seg id="425">Now, Musk concedes: 63,000 had already been withdrawn from the 518,000 pre-orders.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is purely non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">In case of cancellation, Tesla pays the 1000 Euro (in the USA 1000 USD and in Great Britain 1000 pounds) "reservation confirmation" completely back.</seg>
<seg id="428">At the moment 45,000 of such non-binding reservations cancelled up in a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">However, the Tesla leader does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not on demand, but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">All models will be together - 500,000 by 2018 - one million by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, there are currently 1800 reservations a day.</seg>
<seg id="435">Those who order a model 3 today must expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive his brand new production lines, never tested in practice, without any major interruptions with maximum capacity utilization.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>
<seg id="437">But if there is too much delay, the uncertainty of reservations may become a problem for Tesla.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius' church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade on Sunday 16th July at 4.30pm.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius system is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the 6th Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and sponsors Tumbling to their request.</seg>
<seg id="470">"" "Walter Martini emphasized:" "" "it is a unique village gem." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the Chapel of St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church at Tumlingen and the Vogtei "at Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the document, on the hill of Tumlinger, apart from the former parish church, there was also a glorious courtyard to which the church or patron saint was and not vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="473">There were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt from 1858, it was beside the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible in the village of Tumlingen today, the "Berg" the third, the manorial population centre of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the time around 1600 are supporting these historical facts.</seg>
<seg id="476">The privilege of patronage arose from the early medieval period of the church.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church, furnished and occupied with a pastor, remained owner of this church and could also bequeath this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">In this connection, the right to use a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The bigger one of the two was demolished at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be delivered later during the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">During the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the window panes were hammered and the bellows were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops were encamped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and the church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Hilarius cemetery was also the final resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hilariuskirche demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">During the New Year's Eve in 1834 a storm broke through the church tower and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">In order to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower, which is still present today, was preserved as a witness to the 750 years of the history of the church.</seg>

<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved at all at the Boisheim Nette, as at that time in Viersen only at the city border to Schwalmtal was a wind power concentration zone.</seg>
<seg id="509">In this concentration zone construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind power utilization for the rest of the city.</seg>

<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-legged households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersens City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind farm Linnich near Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind turbine plant in Übach-Palenberg in the district Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="683">Where everywhere?</seg>
<seg id="684">Quantity: usually in steinfurt in the furniture market, once a week I help here in Greven in the furniture bridge.</seg>
<seg id="685">And I also worked at school already in the open whole day.</seg>
<seg id="686">What are your experiences with it?</seg>

<seg id="691">Amount: I made SLC.</seg>
<seg id="692">And then a degree in civil engineering, we say, successfully broken off.</seg>
<seg id="693">I recognized for myself that it is my falsehood for me and I want to do something different to work with people.</seg>
<seg id="694">And then I asked myself what do you do.</seg>
<seg id="695">Do a social year, there's an insight, there you can see how it is on the spot, at the focal point maybe, really.</seg>

<seg id="707">I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out.</seg>
<seg id="708">In a different way than studying civil engineering?</seg>
<seg id="709">Quantity: well, here it is not a matter of calculating stupken.</seg>
<seg id="710">There are always other people in front of you who have a completely different story behind them.</seg>
<seg id="711">Whether a refugee, whether a youth who has been fetched out of the family - you have to go into it individually.</seg>

<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded output from European football clubs will not disturb Neymar's world record transfer from Barcelona to Paris-Saint Germain, Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA, as the leading organisation that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious UEFA Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">"" "" "" "financial Fair Play rules, launched in 2011 by UEFA, mean that PSG has to prove that the transfer from Neymar was financed without major losses." ""</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to purchase the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary which will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make money loose so that Neymar is signing and bringing him to a galaxy of other stars in the face of the financing of the team by the ruling family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Associations are allowed to spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but must pay with legitimate income sources, which allow them to break even point in their activities related to football.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success, were effectively cheating and risking to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentrating on the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the novel Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tougher matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">"" "" "" "during the current three-year run-off period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros." ""</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini's popularity has fallen from the Presidency in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to scare off excessive expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future," "" "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week." ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for invoicing over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the selling prices for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 44.4 million euros in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 brought the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the heaviest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of €60 million ($82 million), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by puffing up their revenues associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a catfish company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not count this as a legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of sponsoring the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could be due to payments from the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar World Championship ambassadors will be and such a manoeuvre for UEFA regulators could be easy to find out.</seg>

<seg id="1147">They spoke on the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, since they were not allowed to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the Great Life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced herself from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant queen Anne terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived in a much bigger space with my ex in Knightsbridge," Joanne says.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I was looking for something comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot large apartment has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the generous deck height optimally.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not only about building a simple platform but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">A classic copper light window of Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area for the mezzanine.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille illumination set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">By the perception of a glamorous space the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a little bit of engineering went inside," "" "explains Erfan from the reinforced, veneered MDF door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is important, so if you push the door, it's very easy to slide." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is estimated," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to increase the floor space while using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you do not fall in love with electrical outlets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they don't play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself by a good design and increased square meter of some standard into something completely amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, as Joanne, you could decide not to leave them.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fighting for a 500 million US dollar real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a confrontation over one of Victorias's largest real estate agents worth over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton-Tennis-Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to retire from family business since 2014, but a sharp confrontation over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars since the family purchased a business at Smith Street, Collingwood in 1973.</seg>
<seg id="1360">This was where the Westco family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail shops.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis portfolio now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping malls in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">After an agreement with her late father, Colin - Paul was described as "the main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about a third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court record states that this means that Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The allocation of real estate and cash has proved to be a turning point for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "the commissions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," "" "he wrote in 2015 in a first affirmvit." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The Brothers are now struggling to control the existing business - from which Colin, as Paul claims, excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but throws Paul to manage some possessions incompetent.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early Affidavit, which was submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "my Italian heritage stipulates that the family is the most important priority," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs increase in the event of hundreds of pages with Affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Ceck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both parties.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Wife De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessens from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They took advantage of the safety to buy Collingwood property in Colin's first jeep-shop.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says he started in Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to keep their property safe to their sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"" "" "" "Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," "" "she wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin claims that Mark had paid $10 million and Luke 26 million dollars when he left the company.</seg>
<seg id="1379">Both Luke and Mark are, Paul says, "the terms of their financial separation have become embittered."</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin withdrew very much, although he was a former AFL member and after a biography from Eddie McGuire in 2015, Eddie McGuire was the best friend of the TV star.</seg>

<seg id="1388">The new Chief of Staff Trumps plans to limit the media abstinence of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - hoping to hold the boss on a more consistent course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by Reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior executives on his first working day, he was a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House that he wanted to repair: poor information that came into the hands of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame tears by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps's relationship with television is spanning decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if the candidate Trump was annoyed due to unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were to convince," "" "said the former election campaign manager Sam Nunberg in February to Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "political Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keep Trumps Twitter habit under control, according to six former election campaigners, is to ensure that his personal media consumption entails a steady praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "but the idea that Trumps's Twitter habit was ever" "" "under control" "" "is ridiculous." ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">Maybe these campaign officials know something we don't know - that Trumps Tweets could contain even more fuel without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump did not send.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff made it a few times to keep trouble from him, their efforts have been worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But nobody has consistently been able to prevent Trump's controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, try again and again to present their own agenda by presenting dump material that possibly promotes their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - devoted entirely to this story - reported in May about the preference of the advisers to provide doubtful information to the President for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former pump officials say that Trump, like a volcano, can react to negative press releases, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he insists on figuring out where they come from.</seg>
<seg id="1410">This was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously filed a printed copy of an article by Gotnews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, "being the source behind a heap of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently exiled from Twitter because of chicanes or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has voiced up false allegations and revoked them in the past.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "Trump read the article and began asking staff about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">Gold makers added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the paperwork."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work out?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers still strive for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1445">From the former Hotel Birkenhof is the Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and is to be reopened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof due to the former Ambiente Operating Society mbH on April 13, 2014, some 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and receipts by the visitor's tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the autumn of 2014, in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the county, the hotel building was offered to the District Office as a gathering place, which caused controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers from setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the Municipal Council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties in the house at that time.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should keep right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotel with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star Plus Category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Men's alb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia Affair: us Special Issuer Replaces Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have deployed a so-called Grand Jury after a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The committee recorded the work in recent weeks, wrote the "Wall Street Journal" calling on people familiar with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper evaluated the step as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The broadcaster CNN reported that there were already first plenary meetings in connection with a meeting between Trumps' oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Us secret services accuse the Kremlin for some time intervening in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller investigated whether there were arrangements between Trumps election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The investigation focused on several men who acted as advisors to the Republicans in the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller took a closer look at more and more Trumps's private and business environment.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote a few weeks ago that the special agent Trump personally pulled into the center and undertook the accusation whether the president could possibly hinder the judiciary in the course of the affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to examine the present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether a charge is to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jury are therefore also called Bills of Indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always done behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor's Office in order to invite persons to take part under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to CNN, invitations were already issued, which revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who participated in the meeting had been invited to a statement, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr. also Trumps advisors and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his former boss Paul Manafort were part of the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the introduction showed that Mueller would not intimidate himself in his work and that if necessary, he wanted to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the charging of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to represent the Russia affair as a campaign of political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "Russia's history is a total invention," "" "said Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">"" "the theme gives the democrats a way to" "" "feel good," "" "because they have nothing else to talk about." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special advisor, Ty Cobb, stated in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But I usually work in secret, he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="1506">"" "the White House reverberates any measures that accelerated the work of the special agent in" "" "faire" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1507">"" "" "" "the former FBI chief, James Comey, said three times that it would not be determined against the president." ""</seg>
<seg id="1508">There was no reason to assume that something had changed, it was stated in the statement.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Because of this redesign, accusations against Trump had become louder, he wanted to hinder the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey sat in front of a Senate committee in June, Trump asked him to set up an investigation against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">After displaying US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation about whether Trump Mueller wanted to release.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent special agent of the Congress such as in the Watergate affair about the later stepped up president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the urging of the President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several Senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">Two groups of Republican and Democrat Senators presented draft charges on Thursday, after which the special investigator could no longer be dismissed so easily.</seg>

<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now aborted colossus was part of the Larsen-C-Schelven.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelven is floating on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It therefore continues to grow into the sea and falls regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelven is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">To the north of this ice-ice, the balance of waxes and abrupt was disturbed a couple of years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete piece of shelf is broken down there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelshelf is in danger, as the front edge has never gone as far back as currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can fall apart, if a piece breaks off at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Melting of ice shelf and iceberg does not increase the sea level as it is floating on the water and squeezes ice so much water as it produces after melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, but only to a small extent, the British research project writes on the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C-Schelshelf is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica with almost 50,000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "although it is a natural phenomenon and has no direct connection to climate change, the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary from British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the longest withdrawal since the beginning of the recordings," "" "he also confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Scientists have argued that the Larsen-C-Schelven will grow back or fall back in the long term and possibly coincide, his colleague Adrian Luckman said and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these scientists do not lead the departure of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many ice creators of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart over the past few decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long cycle of Antarctica stretches towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the Antarctic Survey of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has been around three degrees in the last 50 years and thus count among the areas where the temperature rises rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants hoarfrost by the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vacant jobs, the CDU demands from the employers' association to step out to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Just before the summer break, 41 new jobs have been linked to the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 clerks and officials are working for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now, 17 trainees have their first working day behind them.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The apprenticeships at the district are apparently very sought-after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">This year, some 620 applications were recorded for awarding seats.</seg>
<seg id="1557">However, the group still lacks personnel in order to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Currently, there are still 50 unoccupied places in the district of Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">According to the wishes of the parties, the administration aims to "develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development."</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is not only to meet short-term demands on skilled personnel, but to counteract the future-oriented candidate shortage, it is said.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should orientate internally and externally, highlight specific measures for lateral entrants and include a training offensive, require CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to deal with personnel problems that one did not know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities attract good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "the speech is of a veritable" "" "competition of public employers" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">In addition, there is a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age.</seg>
<seg id="1569">The highest time for action, so that there are no more places to remain unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the common application with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He recently took care of a foul surprise when he publicly questioned the human resources costs and stunned the rest of the parties.</seg>
<seg id="1572">"" "" "" "people want all possibilities to be checked, which enable a withdrawal from the local employers' association." ""</seg>
<seg id="1573">"" "" "" "if we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term, the county administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county-affiliated towns - should aim for a Hauscharif," "" "said peoples." ""</seg>
<seg id="1574">In doing so, the CDU tries to better pay the employees and officials than it actually envisages the tariff for the public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are prescribed precisely at present, increases or more money only exists if you switch to a higher level that is oriented towards career years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more over the past few years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago, new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitution Protection Act.</seg>
<seg id="1578">Last but not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, District Council Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few personnel.</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy sharpens the tone to NGO Migrants Rescue Boots</seg>
<seg id="1580">"" "" "" "Italy has warned NGOs that use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they must not continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations." ""</seg>
<seg id="1581">"" "" "" "if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," "" "said the Minister of Interior Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa." ""</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat of the German aid organization 'Youth Rettet', because their team had effectively worked with yodels in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to express itself in extensive allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "for us, the rescue of human life remains our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "" "said the organization in a statement on the social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "we can only judge all the accusations currently raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is assumed that its crew takes dinghy migrants aboard, which are supplied to them directly from traffickers, and that the smugglers can go off so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting occurred supposedly only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's act, whose contents were published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected to override the authority of the Italian Coastguard, the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">"" "" "" "under the Code of Conduct, boats like the Iuventa must have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities." ""</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable as they would not bring any "essential changes or obstructions" of their rescue operations.</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel laureate organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">"" "" "" "Minniti now said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue measures in Italy had declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguards and co-operation with local mayors have borne fruit." ""</seg>

<seg id="1603">There were viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far above the Palatinate forest and the upstream plains.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there were always longer ascents, rewarded for the long trials.</seg>

<seg id="1625">With prominent E-athletes under contract, one could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the German flag to Asia.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">In E-Sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike," or the FIFA World Cup are being challenged at competitive level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">Like in normal sports, leagues have long since established themselves in which the pros compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And in the Asian Games 2022, e-sport is already part of the official program.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the idea is certainly getting used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Also Ingo Frobbing dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sporthochschule in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions which can be found in classical sport, such as increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">It also needs cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction to responsiveness.</seg>

<seg id="1751">One day before the announcement of Audi BMW announced that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The BMW Chairman said the company believes that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," and thus referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is located - forbidding or restricting diesel vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe in order to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the undertakings as recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions regulations.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But nitrogen oxides emitting diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The cost of car manufacturers to install facilities for neutralizing emissions from diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of forgetting the powerful car companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">The companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called write-off devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but driven back under normal driving conditions.</seg>

<seg id="1763">At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent the emissions regulations in Europe, and an inquiry concentrated on the United States has been extended.</seg>
<seg id="1764">The inclusion of Audi into the investigation could have a difficult burden on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the win of Volkswagen.</seg>

<seg id="1779">"" "his message: laughter," "" "for there is too much suffering in the world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first years as an artist he suggested himself as a draughtsman for greeting cards - which frustrated him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said.</seg>
<seg id="1783">After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, he made a breakthrough in the late 1960s: with the release of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then in "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Again and again the artist was inspired by cities.</seg>

<seg id="1795">Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change</seg>
<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened with climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">Lavender is declining because of the conditions reminding of drought and insects that transmit diseases, which causes great headaches to scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively jeopardised because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change over the past few years, which in spring has brought much less rain and much more in autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">"" "there is also a small cichade, a micro-bacterium, the dwarf cicadas transmit, and in very dry weather there are many of them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much at stake.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil not only attracts tourists, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">The solutions that are considered include a better distribution of water and the slowdown of the evaporation from the soil, but also the spraying of plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the Weekly Riodoce usually meet Wednesdays to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure: they should take their children to the office, which was the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a panel at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abdominal feelings will suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on the payroll of government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no respite from violence, and while the bodies are accumulating throughout the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto has taken office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter are their editors and their inspiration from Riodoce, the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," "" "Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a Special Public Prosecutor's Office was established in 2010 in order to deal with the cases of journalists, it has only launched two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of killings associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to trial.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uncomforting and although the terrain is even more traitors.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about murderers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of security has little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know the why, we mistrust everybody." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of the Riodoce newspaper in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated with "twelve river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a wife and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to freely fly around in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest in the past year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, as rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that every day in Sinaloa someone or several people can be shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story mausoleums for drug kings who are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, has broken the debt by not protecting his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First of all, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damascus Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, presumed gangsters bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own security after the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">In 2003 he worked as a veteran reporter for Noroeste, when he joined five colleagues to the establishment of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the problem of intoxicants," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation because of courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising received.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to publish hard-fitting experiments without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot Award" for its reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever it went.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He willingly admitted that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPI award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life," "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompuviento TV." ""</seg>

<seg id="1856">The odours team missed Valdez, the fun-bird, who was able to curb like a port worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>

<seg id="1860">"" "now they ask," "" "Is his love for the routine his ruin?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1863">"" "" "" "these things weren't allowed," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>

<seg id="1866">If it smells bad, stay away from it.</seg>

<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other countries in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the space in which the staff of Riodoce met for safety training, suddenly no mobile phones were allowed. days earlier, Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-range area of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some reporters asked themselves whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the policemen who the governor described as untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It has been months since the reporters have gone to the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has put on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former well-known man, Julio Cesar Chavez, in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state spending concentrated on the home of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, one block from the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was required when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated the political levels almost the whole century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-caliber cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this place, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped from a military attack.</seg>

<seg id="1886">Valdez office became a storage room for signs and stickers, protesting against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they never expected: activists on behalf of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Throughout the country, journalists have become louder by writing in organized protests "SOS Press" on pavements and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez goes away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and releasing them because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since asked her to be again divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">"" "Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were" "" "surrounded" "" "by organised crime, involved government officials and an indifferent society." ""</seg>

<seg id="1928">Its incredibly well-preserved state has amazed scientists who describe it as "truly remarkable."</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivorous is the best preserved fossil in its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk when he digged at the Suncor Millenium Mine on March 21, 2011 near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that was out of place in the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.</seg>

<seg id="1934">After all this hard work the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only smile a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.</seg>

<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this herbivorous, although covered with a armor and resembles a changing tank, probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as juxtaposition, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed himself to mingle better with his surroundings and evade his enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurier family has made headlines in May and is now to be seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markenchelli, according to the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter-shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the today living animals.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaur was driven by enough pressure by eating carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution favored the concealment of the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the counter shading - think of deer, zebras or shingles - are much smaller and vulnerable than loot, which signalizes that this nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "" "" "strong predator behaviour on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur carnivores had to have been the Cretaceous period," "" "said Brown." ""</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal for information about his life, including his conserved intestinal content to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>

<seg id="1955">The Cretaceous period was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was chased by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was drowned after death in the ocean and mumbled in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he digged at the Suncor Millenium Mine on March 21, 2011 near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the world's best armored dinosaur, including skin and armor, and is completely from muzzle to hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weigh up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips resting on his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores were swept through the western Canada until a flooded river was flooding it into the open sea.</seg>

<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Only one day after she arrived in New York City, the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an airbnb apartment she rented and scrolling through Facebook on her phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled over a post by someone from high school.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"" "" "" "the police have just killed an 18-year-old child and it is still on the street," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused, because nobody else posted the information on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly retweaned at her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rapper from the area of St. Louis was to tweeten the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed live by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretching out on the street and staying there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"" "" "" "that's wild," "" "said Ferrell." ""</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new to them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She placed her cell phone to return later in the evening to tweets over people on the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of police and people shouting, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father who bore a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson's police killed just my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"" "in another video, she said, another policeman was his gun and shouted," "" "I am going to kill you... animals all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"" "" "" "this is not common," "" "said Ferrell to her statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="2035">"" "" "" "this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt chills.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and cried. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 11pm she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened over the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from the 11th.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and of the protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists in the perspective of people living in the community and filling the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter, who carried a cauldron and a matching crown, the two discussed a conversation that they had "over the black experience and the black state innumerable times before this morning."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "" "she remembered what she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2044">"" "" "" "we are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right." ""</seg>
<seg id="2045">"" "I couldn't take it with me," "" "said Ferrell later." ""</seg>
<seg id="2046">"" "" "" "what has happened today is a high point of what happened in the past." ""</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and be raised therein.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed not only to know activism and organization, but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution, and what we need to do to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a blatant racism, she is no different from the next black women child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"" "I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a camp territory when the activists were waiting for the possible non-accusation of officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism was totally changed after August 9," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of the Minority Student Nurses Association, concentrating on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organising.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It's all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">"" "Folayan said she and her cameraman, Lucas Alvarado-Farrar, wanted to" "" "document" "" "what happened." ""</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "a question came to Ferrell:" "" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">"" "as Folayan recently stated in an interview:" "" "we heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already collaborated with the former co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt inmates.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years following Brown's shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"" "" "" "this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us. we're talking," "" "said Davis." ""</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "that was the main thing for me, as these people are presented, because I'm going to be represented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to concentrate on Ferris's experience - to show that the movement "is not a messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - it proved to be the most open participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result, documents of "Whose Streets?" show surprising personal aspects of Ferris's life as she falls in love and marries her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell, laughing when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I have understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the dehumanization of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, who after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 have shaped the film "Blacklive Matter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and we are constantly fighting on different fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">"" "black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "Folayan agreed to note that" "" "the movement is really held by black women and many black women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">"" "however, it insists that" "" "this is not an affirmatiype of action," "" "at which Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film because of her identity." ""</seg>
<seg id="2077">"" "" "" "she was the person who shook up this energy," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2078">"" "" "" "it's no coincidence, though it was at the forefront, because in a life at these junctions as a black, gay woman stands as much on the game." ""</seg>
<seg id="2079">"" "you can feel their energy through the screen." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2080">Meanwhile the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial links between the church and the police continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Nevertheless she clings to a song and she feels obliged to this memory since she went into Ferguson three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"" "" "" "it is our duty to fight for our freedom." ""</seg>

<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people, even though it is not built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping mall on the southern end of the pedestrian precinct has split the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The topic hardly leaves one cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"" "the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page" "" "Volksfreund Bitburg" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2093">While some say to the bit gallery: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be real class" (Nicole Schuster), comes from the other side: "no man needs" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the proponents build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, from what the rest of the shops also profit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will circulate.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmers market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketing products offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">The construction work will start at the end of the construction work.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery-Macher plans to integrate a market hall into the new building - Beda-square with the possibility of sitting outside.</seg>

<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, shoes, drugstore or supermarkets: I think that's superfluous.</seg>

<seg id="2109">One can see how many shop shops are vacant here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a regular weekly market there, it is all the more important that at least the market hall will be preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the product offered there is fresh, is mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive on top.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, stores in a shopping mall are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not wearable for a retailer.</seg>

<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall does not fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">First of all: where should the farmers market hall go?</seg>

<seg id="2123">Once the farmers market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are visible - white, black and brown, that almost imperceptibly resemble - that hang from the ceiling on cables.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The thirty portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after she publicized the WikiLeaks website as secret diplomatic news.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called A Becoming resemblance (a suitable similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline has united its expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transitress and groundbreaking dissident, whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, such as someone with these genomic data, a sharp, though somewhat intellectual commentary not only to the formation of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward but openly talked about identification as a woman since she was puberty, was convicted of 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">By the prison her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie, in which Manning obviously sits on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blonde wig - with whom she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette stub and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste to produce an image of how these people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">She could not be photographed at that time and she could not be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated muse became an unequal measure, which in the course of two years exchanged several letters.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a comic "Suppressed Image," illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the President would convert chÃ ¢Judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama is actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas would be a welcome type of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, since Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender forces in order to find new tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions that he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">"" "when Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that" "" "things happen for a particular reason." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for an end to the "automatic fragmentation, the basis of sex, race, sexuality, and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides following the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist) how astonishing similarly, at least in organic terms, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with them is that our genome does not care who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works from 2007, Spurious Memories, are also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the above mentioned comic novel.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning how she dips with a hands-free phone in the hand from the disciplinary gymnastics of the United States like King Kong.</seg>

<seg id="2153">"I still get goosebumps when I talk about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it, then she will be greeted by the masks in the middle of the room, from her own genomic simulacons, which intertwine like hordes of protesters.</seg>

<seg id="2205">Responses were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - deceitful.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity some workers did not trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"" "" "" "there was simply never consistency and objectivity," "" "said Errett, who runs the 75 person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed." ""</seg>
<seg id="2208">She called on people from the outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new Human Resources Start-up race is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">Through the creation and licensing of software, which has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, provide special groups and demographic groups, provide employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases whistleblowers allow to circumvent the C-suite managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up GLINT, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap-surveys and surveys of specific teams, it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low requirements - so you can drill down why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that they have to remain at the top of the workplace culture so that you won't be the next Uber wrapped up in scandals, since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment where those who have spoken have been punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups such as GLINT, this desire is an overview of a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>

<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent bad behavior and recognize, saw a growing interest and activity beginning this year in the middle of the Uber-Falles in Misskredit.</seg>

<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the court of public opinion has captured the regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company is found that treats its employees poorly or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences from consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, Convercent has been used for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or e-mail for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, as the company Convercent uses, problems that have previously been hidden by executives in offices in cities or states - like discrimination, harassment or unfair trainees- can be identified and addressed faster.</seg>

<seg id="2234">Both GLINT and Convercent provide your software as a service, and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find the approval of Venture Capital Investors who have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convergence received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitter won $10 million in November from Bessemer venture partner and brought his total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing research complex that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are only wagering requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company, feel their voices heard and that the work you are doing is worthwhile, then they feel more obligated to make this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convergence and GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and the use of the staff, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks employees after your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change doesn't come fast enough, or not at all, this can curtail disappointments and demotify employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"" "" "" "if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations," "" "said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management firm Kotter International who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data." ""</seg>

<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate actions on the same day if a problem is reported about GLINT, so Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after the gathering of feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganize several teams within the company through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">In the case of Ruby Tuesday, the company gets new insights into its employees and hopes that in the long run this leads to better bonding of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover.</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his recent past, Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980's.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from its cozy seat in the Irene River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"" "" "" "I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," "" "he says falsely." ""</seg>

<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England 'spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another, upcoming British artist - Isaac steering iewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: in 2014 he wrote 'Dead Man's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"" "" "" "I only responded to the thumb relief on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2298">"" "" "" "that's his thumb impression!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2299">And letters always smell of smoke, for at that time a fire was kindled because of the light.</seg>
<seg id="2300">For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he himself was there.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Oh, I love archives! "</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is so treated with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I have overrated my welcome's greetings a little"), this seems to be too beautiful to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena pots on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the trenches.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He wandered through the complex and the ruins of the old castle and spoke to landscape painters, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">"" "then, at night he drank" "" "Whiskey" "" "and began to write." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown because the National Trust only gained full access in 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the clerks just began to look after the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said," Oh, throw it on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the period of English Empires, maps showing who had something: "you could think that land conflicts would be boring," Rhodes says, "but there was a birch to fight the two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let's go all the way! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse in the English history on a broader base, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a rebellion which occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', Rhodes says.</seg>

<seg id="2313">"" "perhaps the two are connected?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit patter that the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell is portrayed in the 18th century, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was excavated).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes's favourite family of Scotney: "the gentlemen seem to be quite a crook, always doing debts and spending money on things they could not afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crisis by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking boys, with a talent to woo returns. "</seg>
<seg id="2318">After the end of its operation in the castle, Rhodes is searching for other unique writing experiences</seg>
<seg id="2319">He has spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämämäki, the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature.</seg>

<seg id="2347">Since the coup failed, head of state Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.</seg>
<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged ties to the movement of the Inexil preacher Fethullah Gülen, which Erdogan sees as a wirepuller of the coup attempt.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just when you thought that 2017 couldn't be even more crazy, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and Co-founder of the FRR, we must start taking her ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of it, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more often," said Mr. Sharkey when he published his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpuppen have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions, which are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"" "the user can" "" "customize" "" "his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything from the eyecrow of the robot over the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails." ""</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it becomes even more disturbing since many robots possess the "personalities" that would make a stepford woman look progressively.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot, for example, enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"RoxxxPlus Gold has a personality that is as good as possible to your personality," enthuses True Companion's website.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day it also has its moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, be fixed on conversation or she can be" "" "in mood" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female properties, the allusions to rape, when one goes one step to Frigid (meaning here: reluctant) Farrah, trouble one the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy behaved with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxxy?" is it on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their formation and increasing sophistication point to something dark and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men, of course, will not hold any sex robots, and while the FRR notes its increasing popularity, they nevertheless remain at the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what seeps out of the boundary zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots emerge in a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted women to be sexually assaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most disappointing aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') is not the graphic images, the intricate body and the stunted eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The aim behind these sex robots is to create a physical similarity to actual women as realistically as technically possible (although with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their growers want them to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, when it comes to their" "" "personalities" "", "the robots are no real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background history, nothing that indicates independence or anything that might disturb the fantasy of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the language of 2017: maid</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized American electorate have also split families in small formats.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving Day, there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all purportedly strain ourselves to burst our filter bags.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of Trumps to bring families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a leftist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the republican relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics, is suddenly and quite strange on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">Around the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it is in a further context that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that one day his bibs will no longer repel us.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans of the right wing "normalize," which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself falling from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urcomical version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both compared to Trump in fact seem to be a very mild offence.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans will only be spiritually healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the carousels of the New York car park, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need a caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are quaint and the animals twist in order to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the perpendicular music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines become familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city is not just the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss cottage - the topic-pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The central park carousel is still a strange magic experience, as here two two-year-old, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40-ties can go on it and have all a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was indestructible, while I tired the experience of submitting my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius transferred to hospital with chest pain</seg>

<seg id="2452">Because of murder after an appeal by the prosecutors, Pistorius was sentenced to a first death sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning of Valentine's Day 2013 by firing her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he had his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder that hid himself in the cabin.</seg>

<seg id="2535">Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbaumeister, will retire next year.</seg>
<seg id="2536">The place is already written out - but suitable candidates are rare.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Wacker has been City Builder for the past 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work is still a lot of fun for him, as he teaches in the press conference.</seg>
<seg id="2539">He reports about varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, it is surprising that no application has ever fulfilled the requirements profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">Thus - taking notice of the regular notice periods - shall be enough time for a familiarisation.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach acts as a lower building law authority for the administrative community, the applicant has to show relevant degrees.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If they could no longer fill them out, then the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But the proximity to the citizens is important to the city and to him, says Wacker, who reports from a good working climate and good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens.</seg>

<seg id="2556">"" "" "" "you can move a lot," "" "said Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors." ""</seg>
<seg id="2557">As the old town as an ensemble is listed as an ensemble, it is important to "have an eye on what fits in" when new buildings are approved, the outgoing city architect emphasizes.</seg>
<seg id="2558">Anyway, the Stadtbaumeister has a high level of responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="2559">"" "he is the builder," "" "in the end everything is running over my table." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2560">He can count on many years of employee support and coordination: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been doing so for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) has been working for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2561">Also, that his successor stays for a long time, Wacker wishes: "we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place."</seg>
<seg id="2562">Continuity is not only important for a good working climate, but also for the further design of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2563">Those who want to bury Roland Wacker should, according to information from the city of Haslach, have a completed academic degree as a diploma engineer or Bachelor with specialization in architecture and have good knowledge in the areas of building planning and building planning law.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The municipal building department is subject to civil engineering, civil engineering, civil engineering, urban property management, municipal depot and municipal gardening as well as the lower construction law office, including monument protection.</seg>

<seg id="2568">The investigators go out of two male offenders and have been looking for them since the night hours.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meats and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition affecting about 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in Great Britain causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products in order to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells are patrolling in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in the food do not enter the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are evened by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the equilibrium leads too far towards inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments it was found that a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a specific bacterium in its intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - in order to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacteria species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet tolerant to tryptophan, more tolerant, less inflammatory bowmilieus, if the same system is also beneficial in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoctoral student Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan was investigating a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance, when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same stem that had not been separated.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbial growth of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were sequenced in DNA and six species of bacteria were found, which were present in mice with immune cells, but were missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so that an intestinal microbiome was absent and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the Genevteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria were working on the immune system, the researchers led Genreuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified out of the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as an inhibitory 3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's food, the number of cells increased by around 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells fell by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially, high tryptophan levels can lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. reuteri. "</seg>

<seg id="2672">Those who want to rehabilitate his home in the years can soon get support from the country.</seg>
<seg id="2673">On Wednesday, Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives informed city development on Wednesday in sensations.</seg>
<seg id="2674">At the beginning of the information event, Schindler gave a review of what has happened so far.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Since 1991 there have been sanitation areas.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Back then, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding amount.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, previous sanitations are a "achievement project" - it is finally important to promote interior development and not only to open up new construction areas.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, I received the information from Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe that there will be a rehabilitation area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The funding amount amounts to 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 Euros are coming from the country, the rest of the municipality's sensations.</seg>
<seg id="2681">How is a renovation area created?</seg>
<seg id="2682">One will continue to investigate, as Schindler, where the "really old" houses are.</seg>
<seg id="2683">It also plays a role whether there is any interest in the planned area to rehabilitate.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If necessary, the area boundaries could then be postponed again.</seg>
<seg id="2685">The bridge represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"" "Keller presented the contents of the federal state program" "" "Social City" "" "in which the restructuring would then be carried out." ""</seg>
<seg id="2687">The core of the program is the revitalisation of inner cities, improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="2688">The measures would be object-related, i.e. per plot, carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2689">The renovation area would then finally be set as a statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The licensing period for the funding has been ongoing since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Until September of this year, however, the stocktaking will only be carried out, within the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="2692">In November or December the statute review should be carried out as far as possible so that the renovation can begin next year.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann subsequently declared that each commune had to carry out the forecasted cautions.</seg>
<seg id="2694">The aim is to evaluate and decide the urban conditions and to decide when to renovate and to what extent.</seg>

<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="2718">The helicopter, manufactured in Connecticut, was on display next to a yacht from Maine, a fire engine from Wisconsin and a truck from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The White House Military Bureau required the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or cargo, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superior, the deputy commander of the aviation.</seg>
<seg id="2721">The message indicated that the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn on 17 July at 7 o'clock in the morning and so long until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 o'clock in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed, a second crew would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of the service hours.</seg>

<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-Report on the abuse-cases relieves Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "Wir sind Kirche," explained after publication in front of the German press agency, he expected from the former Regensburg bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emerict Pope Benedict XVI, an apology.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would very much serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their false appraisal of the processes at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican newspaper" "" "Osservatore Romano" "", "on the other hand, criticised that" "" "double standards" "" "were measured in reporting on violence in the Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubted that "shameful and shameful deeds" would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation" was striking, "says the author Lucetta Scarlett, Historian and Member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of describing the Catholic Church as a source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep this for normal," "" "writes Scarlia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk, Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis said:" "" "we would like to go to the church and this is a prisoner of interest." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "moreover, she pointed out that in her youth," "" "putts have been a very normal educational tool" "" "to cope with bold children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They found it unfair to apply today's standards to past decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with reports about abuse of abuse pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrongly, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who authored the memory band "My Brother of the Pope" with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take Georg Ratzinger's protection," says Hessian, "for all this had nothing to do with it," he evaluates the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440 pages report that the lawyer Ulrich Weber commissioned with the Enlightenment, commissioned by the diocese of Regensburg?</seg>
<seg id="2904">In a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen was sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is called Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be said that, in many cases, cathetals of physical and psychological violence were used by the master-master R..</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially in the case of high emotionality, punishment for the students was even more intense.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "nevertheless, contrary to numerous other defendants, many victims considered the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even had positive memories with him despite violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In an interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen station Georg Ratzinger explains in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "incidents of Violence Exercise" "" "at the" "" "Regensburger Domspatzen" "", "is a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">On the one hand, many pupils stand out for their "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears as a cholerician and perfectionist who became palpable by the Öfteren when a Domspatz brought no top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is common in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Even the excesses of violence at the pre-school took place outside of its sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">At best, one can submit to him, to experience it too late or to have taken early indications of not being taken seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the Domspatzengymnasium on which he worked was perceived by virtually all interviewees as" "" "salvation," "" "heaven" "", "" "" "heaven" "", "and" "" "better world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">The vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, presented an excellent testimony, describing him as "warm-hearted," "popular," "honest," "competent" and "understanding," as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy and "always surrounded by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains of its perfectionism and its high emotional appeal, which also led to outbreaks of rage.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he was not only popping up with chairs and throwing the key ring on the floor, but also distributing ear-cowards and drew too naughty boys on the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable period, the 1960s and 1970s, in parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what it actually is about in this report, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the violent excesses at the pre-school, this is true of Bagatella.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it has to do with his familiarity and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just rushed on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Many people who have never understood him are still eagerly working on the Bavarian pope.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In connection with the report a lot about the abuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen was reported in the media.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger mentioned in the final report also some involvement or complicity in regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael hesemann: no, no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have been entrusted to the master of the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I have never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," "" "said one of the afflicted on behalf of the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in the education of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most of the victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader, who, in some cases, would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do Ratzinger's Ratzinger's Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael hesemann says: "regarding sexual abuse... I don't see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely realizations and could have stopped the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... also for really absurd to assume that it is equivalent to him... to be more urgent or more clear or more open than to her parents, dormitory leaders, confidant teachers etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "this is how the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "that the students and / or their surroundings affected him in the run-up could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is thus acquitted of any complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to associate its good name with these atrocious crimes, as it happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media much of" "" "violent excesses" "" "was to be read at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former cathedral-master Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "looking away" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael hesemann: that's the big problem that everything was mixed up and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and abuse of violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is exactly what is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is, namely, cleanly separated: between the preschool and the high school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence, we once again say other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, thus also for four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choral director of the Cathedral-cats.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole awful test pedagogy, the cases in which the boys were regularly harassed by sadistic teachers and suffered terribly, all took place at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions had to prevail.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those, Domkapellmeister had nothing to do with Georg Ratzinger, because he got the boys to face when they were already on the Domspatzengymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on that, like most witnesses pointed out, the subject" "" "Primary School" "" "taboo." ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">"" "one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even" "" "paradisiacal" "" "conditions." ""</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael hesemann: indeed, there was discipline, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" "" "many sacrifices have appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in numerous cases, despite violence, can even combine positive memories with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">So at most it remains the reproach to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he just started to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was just not working and responsible, (as the witness) did not want to hear, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Was Georg Ratzinger spared his ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael hesemann: no, because in 1989, he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out that" "" "in the preschool it will continue to practice the punishment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">In the face of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This, of course, was at a time when legal clarity had long been banned in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that they took place in a legal grey-zone, as each of us knows still white.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to assess where the affected people might be exaggerated or dramatized, and where the admissible limit was actually exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That's just not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the examination of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis maintained that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael hesemann:" "" "we historians are talking about the" "" "pitfall of anachronism" "", "i.e. the danger of judging the past according to modern moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this, of course, does not apply to sexual abuse, which at all times was abhorrent and also not for what was faded in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond that at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">That's all terrible and I'm glad that it's finally being worked up.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger's protection, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishing, that is to say earnests and ears and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then forbidden, it also kept strictly adhering to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "which picture of his time in Regensburg asked Georg Ratzinger for the interview with you for the book" "" "My Brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of testing also a language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, tells us from his perspective that the Cathedral sparrows played only a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In spite of this, I did not deny that he had a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this has to be said once: without this perfectionism, without the demands of unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world-class, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candy alone, the unruly boys don't even make big singers and before each success, regardless of the area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you experience as Georg Ratzinger during the talks with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael hesemann: through the work in the book and beyond that, I met Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced again and again as wonderful, humorous, basic, deeply believing and heart-good people, from which one can not imagine that he could only do something on a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get in touch with him, like many former Domspatzen, 23 years after his posting, visit him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who did not forgive him until now, that he was once strict to them, are therefore clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of them are thankful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them the world of music to them.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always was a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, sure that it may be - but also a lovely disrespect, to which they still look up today and which they almost venerate.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once more clearly: all that is presented to him are educational methods which at that time were on the order of the day.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long since overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is most unjust to make a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to become a media scapegoat.</seg>
