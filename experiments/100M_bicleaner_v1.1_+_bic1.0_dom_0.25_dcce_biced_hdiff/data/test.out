J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
the Hollywood star has now clearly made it clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will always be stuck in drawers or glued on from outside labels that have little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself have no desire to be always perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ estly , these things are rather sn@@ u@@ ff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about the fact that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opol@@ itan . &quot;
the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , in front of a television with loose de@@ br@@ is and Mexican food , it &apos;s called in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for white gl@@ ut , she brings the question of the desire for children : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is a single mother of two sons .
the film will run on August 25th .
Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the Sport pyrami@@ de
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger with some colleagues looked for some di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old , it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday , they were hunting in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p home to the trou@@ ghs .
a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and so the riding career ended again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer ever was - 101 tournament wins - again near horses .
he let himself be led by his family through the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even ho@@ ver for photographic purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and there@@ with also with the CH@@ IO .
the reason was absolutely convincing .
the German Sport Team presented the Golden Sports pyramid to the man from An@@ hausen in the frame of a small gala .
there is no lack of awards to the li@@ ke@@ able ath@@ lete .
silver lau@@ rel leaf , Champions Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already ad@@ jured him .
long is the 18th prize winner of the Sport pyrami@@ de .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lan@@ ger says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been promoting young talents for decades .
and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ time US master &apos;s winner was admitted to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the athletes are the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the rider Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ driver Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the jum@@ per Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um the Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports legend came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company moved to the Spring@@ ste@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza price was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ um@@ ps Economic Policy Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing the T@@ TP trade deal - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential candidates are not at odds with regard to tax and energy policy , as well as in a fundamental principle .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton are fundamental , rather philosophical .
that , on the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep those in doubt small and cau@@ tions about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to tax the economy and regulate it to death , he says .
he himself would be quite different , claims Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will massi@@ vely return regulations and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has to fulfil certain tasks , it has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities to open up and needs money for it .
that is why the taxes on the rich would increase , they say .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure .
in order to invest , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost word @-@ like .
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the state @-@ critical tea party wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
so there could be party internal discussions on Tr@@ ump .
the differences in energy and climate policy are more clear .
Tr@@ ump is planning to build coal @-@ fired power plants and re @-@ use coal mining in the USA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , he wants to termin@@ ate the Paris Climate Protection Agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with its investment program , Clinton , on the other hand , intends to expand renewable energies and demand : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only with the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far apart .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ fish trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
at the same time , both the US do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs .
they should be paid better , e.g. Clinton .
the current minimum wage of US $ 7.@@ 25 is a star@@ vation .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump is about to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must rise up , he says he cannot be changed .
but the great discussion of the months ahead is likely to be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps .
on the one hand stands Tr@@ ump , who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth .
his critics point to him that the budget deficit would only be even greater .
on the other hand Clinton stands , who wants at least from the rich to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every fled woman has experience with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is almost part of everyday life for women who are fle@@ eing alone .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each of them has a baby , which is at the most a year old .
one has put her little son in her arms .
he looks curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is being watched .
she sm@@ iles briefly and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene is normal .
until one talks to Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the Managing Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social services in Bavaria , and deals with the subject of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are refugees .
they live in the Munich north in one of the few decentr@@ alised dwell@@ ings for all@@ otted women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs opened the facility together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich women &apos;s aid .
recently it was officially opened .
there are 60 people living there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her flight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ahr says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee for wars because they are persecuted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as hopes of hope , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; women out@@ weigh other reasons for their escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many are ste@@ aling in secret because they do not see any other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honour mor@@ als , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this drives them away .
on the run , that goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tu@@ gs , for example , demand a sexual act for a bottle of water , is no r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone ; they are not protected by their families .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who believes that when they come to Germany , they &apos;re mistaken , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
here too , single women in refugee camps would often be regarded as inferior and in the worst case ab@@ used .
this results in roughly 90 per cent of women who live in the Munich north , are trau@@ mati@@ zed , they estimate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children certainly did not come up voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so used to the fact that they do not say anything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they dare not speak openly about what is experienced , because the shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , more accommodations are needed only for them , B@@ ahr demands .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
some with no answer to the question whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction .
in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing in the housing of governments .
also in Sw@@ ab@@ ia , single @-@ wing@@ ed women are not accommodated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government .
in some common shel@@ ters in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Middle Fran@@ con@@ ia , there are only common shel@@ ters or own houses for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations alone for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it is said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women be accommodated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of privacy or will men and women stay together , it can come to - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women .
how much the women feel this need for protection can be read off at the rush which is on the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has been around us that there are us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could easily set up a second house .
assistance physicians strike : demands for new work combat measures
representatives of the assistance physicians have called upon their union to appro@@ ve new work combat measures in their dispute regarding a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) demanded its entire advice to appro@@ ve more labour action measures from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC asser@@ ted that ministers had agreed to address the concerns about the contract .
in July , assistance practitioners and medical students voted in favour of the rejection of a contract agreed with by the BM@@ A .
it was rejected by 58 % of its members voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who were posted on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; problems , which led to the rejection of the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC committee voted in favour of rej@@ ecting the proposed new treaty and requ@@ esting official re@@ negotiations for all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC board today filed a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve an ongoing programme of escal@@ ating labour action measures beginning in early September .
the dispute caused assistance physicians to strike six times this year , the first complete cases in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A assistance physician Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ ig@@ ned after the election to reject the agreed contract terms which were recommended by the BM@@ A .
he divided the BM@@ A members during the sessions that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 practitioners and medical students , that the treaty was beneficial and should be accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t , said that the contract for physicians in England would be forci@@ bly introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to announce an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gil@@ ded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace , I can &apos;t deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile was narrow@@ er and he radi@@ ated hardly any heat , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan said repeatedly of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but can even be improved .
the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if something bad had never happened .
to me his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s em@@ be@@ zz@@ ling , sustainable cows showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had not forgotten anything .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the shooting of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was inc@@ iner@@ ated .
Putin den@@ ounced and accused Ankara of falling behind Russia .
the off@@ ence was even greater since it was celebrated by a put@@ ative friend .
building up the c@@ ous@@ y will be difficult if not impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state controlled media carried out a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything .
the most serious accus@@ ations led by senior officials that Erdo@@ gan had benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria areas controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has v@@ ehem@@ ently denied this .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead .
after all , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdo@@ gan to hear him .
Russia could record a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the benefits of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan mainly needs all the friends he can get after he has lost almost his office last month with a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shocked him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists every year to the Turkish coast .
the number dropped by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late seasonal attack on the Mediterranean .
this week , the state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti put it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there , tomatoes there long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious on the West , as it looks at its response to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is due to the ongoing gru@@ dge about the EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Ankara , the Russian head of state gained a bonus for the fact that after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat he demanded support for the elected state organs .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep sense of fear of regime change .
the summit in this da@@ zz@@ ling palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to demonstrate , as an analy@@ st once described to me , &quot; An Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries that feel dis@@ cour@@ aged and treated badly by the West and are now al@@ lied .
nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently played the role of a peac@@ emaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents met at the press conference saying that they had not even stri@@ pped the subject .
the president of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin decided to stress it .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and considering the potential for a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian combat jet , it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for Scotland customers
according to the board of directors of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand can only be reduced more to a back @-@ office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told the Scotland Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was associated with the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the Bank dis@@ soci@@ ated itself when it had to be saved and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this period , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported international sports with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations rug@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don Win@@ ner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to put more national brands into focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the decentr@@ alized head office and the stock exchange listing to Nat@@ West will change .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for retail , which are more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
during a viewing tour of customers and employees , Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our investor brand and the brand under which our employees will be occupied , as we are now going to become a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
I now say that we don &apos;t pursue global goals , but local goals .
each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work among these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue its Six Nations Sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to become a bank of the brands , because how do we focus internally ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for clients ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we had said that we would be a great bench for our customers and launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori achieves its 3.@@ 000@@ th gain on a pre@@ dile@@ ction at New@@ market
D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ yed champagne after a double at New@@ market , who gives him 3,000 prize money
Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday .
he set a milestone on Pre@@ dile@@ ction , who is trained by John Gos@@ den on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey who reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he succ@@ eeds Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the triple winner , D@@ ett@@ ori , who won at G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar before , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori w@@ akes up the che@@ er when he gets the victory on Pre@@ dile@@ ction
two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time der@@ by@@ winner had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 car@@ eers
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of the modern and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone , which only a few have reached before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma thrilled fans for years for this sport .
I told Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already taken 6,000 wins if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament ho@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie has already won nearly 30 years of winners in the UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition , he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the fi@@ gu@@ re@@ head of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a ban on drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three years ago he encountered difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and to return to his best form .
and he &apos;s not finished yet - D@@ ett@@ ori said earlier that he wants to continue at competitions up to his age of at least fifty years .
Russian Putin sack@@ ed Chief of staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin recently dismissed Sergei Ivan@@ ov &apos;s Chief of Staff .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V has been part of Putin &apos;s most intimate circle for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Represent@@ ative for environmental and transport matters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement of the Krem@@ lin , it is said that Putin has ordered the release of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as president of the Russian presidential administration without giving reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was the Ivan@@ ov@@ s Sub@@ stitute since 2012 , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital Tall@@ inn , he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy .
on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website it is called ( in Russian ) that he was later the log@@ chief and chief of staff of the government personnel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the government &apos;s most important task to support your action as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov was asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
do the smiling faces convince you ?
this step has made Moscow mysti@@ cal .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was one of the closest colleagues Vladimir Putin for a long time and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ ig@@ ned at his own request .
but in spite of the smile for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , shortly before the parliamentary elections .
so here is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at this time .
but the official asser@@ tion that a man who once was promoted as a potential president , at once would like to guide Russian environmental policy , met with great skep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin , who are quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said : &quot; it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - compla@@ ining posts for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V took the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as President of the K@@ GB state security service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was the Chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin reached power , he called Ivan@@ ov one of five people he trusted most .
once it was assumed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia because a third term was viol@@ ating Putin &apos;s constitution .
but this post was taken by another close ally Put@@ ins , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before becoming president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son took part in a physical examination on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced his res@@ ignation in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the special agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the announcement of his res@@ ignation on Thursday .
on the set it came to artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the character Gib@@ son from the series , which follows a team of FB@@ I agents , is expected to be published at a later stage according to the ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com D@@ har@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , was with us since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and put my entire lif@@ eb@@ lo@@ od in the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hoped to be there until the end , but that won &apos;t be possible anymore .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a series .
the air@@ ing of the twel@@ fth season will be scheduled for September 28th .

Que@@ ens@@ board Crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the north deck of the Que@@ ens@@ board cross@@ ings with the vi@@ a@@ duct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four locks of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cover blo@@ wers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; approaching completion by each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 be@@ vel @-@ ropes .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keith Brown reported a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to move from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Que@@ ens@@ board cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic extent in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ a@@ duct and the bridge deck is a delicate work requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit .
overall , almost 79 % of the total bridge deck is at their place and the last section of Dec@@ ks today gets a concrete shot for the deck in Ros@@ y@@ th , meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , project manager at For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in each bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fantastic project represents the closure of future @-@ oriented civil engineering and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the existing north tower deck , we had to close the existing gap on the north or land@@ side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ meters to the south .
this was a massive and at the same time very sensitive activity .
massi@@ vely , because the vi@@ a@@ duct is 2@@ 22 meters long , weighs around 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % .
delicate since the tolerances on which the team worked were tiny - on each side they were just a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after being thrown off by their fishing boat to Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station hit Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alert after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had trouble swimming in safety while their boat moved from their own power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat rolling around and placed the worst in front of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leader of the life station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds ble@@ w the boat out of reach , until we left water , &quot; he added .
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a bu@@ o@@ y without life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water are lucky and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boot @-@ engine had an emergency stop , but it loos@@ ened the boat from the person who controlled the boat .
someone has w@@ aked over these men today .
seriously injured - man stab@@ s to his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked and severely injured his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife .
as the police announced yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to pick up his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .

the latter then al@@ armed his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
she could not move him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her companion .
on the street they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ girlfriend .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who builds the cheap apartments of Braunschweig ?
the SPD and the Gre@@ ens are saying : investors should take much stronger responsibility in the future .
how do you react to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose nearly 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; action concept for housing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the next council session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but quar@@ rel is programmed .
first of all , the question is : who should build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann believes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : if you want to build urban areas , you will have to pay 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cheap apartments , however , can also arise in the continu@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big dispute in the town hall is , as viol@@ a : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build on such areas at least 10 percent , but as much as 20 percent of the housing as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new urban housing development programme that will cost millions and still have to be financed should provide incentives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , said Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no agreement currently between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few rules as possible .
the left wants even harder conditions for investors .
despite this , viol@@ a , a tightening of the situation on the housing market is van@@ ished .
if the action concept is implemented , this will ensure additional tasks in the building administration .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the program is not yet complete : for the 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how do you compensate for the loss of more around 1300 favourable apartments , whose funding will exp@@ ire in the next few years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , according to the planning spokesperson Nicole Palm , current ties should now be purchased from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought to bring apartments back into the price relationship .
this is possible in the western city .
in one fell s@@ woo@@ p the problem could be solved .
because in the west city there are deadlines for the end of the year .
around 1800 homes you could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : they do not want the owners , the housing associations .
for if the number of social housing in the West is increased again drastically , it is removed from the goal of so @-@ called mix @-@ up .
there should not be a concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged in only a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens are counting on the fact that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has concentrated on more sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise can still be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness worth
it is fascinating to watch how the world changes .
the fact that teenagers and children are no longer allowed to play outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time star@@ ing on screens has been compla@@ ined of many over the last decade .
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and last on smartphones .
so it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other .
of course , I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s ( later an animated series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
like many pop culture phenomena , interest in the release of the game in the US , Australia and New Zealand declined in early July .
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ bur@@ dened the server .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ mon that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( over a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured &quot; can be captured .
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the del@@ usion and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa .
in the United States , the game has led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person withdraw@@ s every day .
Car@@ di@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , tracking 3@@ 5.000 users , announced the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of followed people who train every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who is playing the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely watches the raw data to increase performance .
many public awareness campaigns that people want to make &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; to &quot; get away from the sofa &quot; and &quot; to be active every day &quot; have deaf ears , because many public messages about health are boring and come from people looking mis@@ erable .
however , the importance of sports cannot be over@@ rated .
whoever push@@ es sports regularly reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression .
exercise helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here .
but the wonder@@ full of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
three pillars of health are thus covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even join in new friend@@ ships during the hunt .
as always , there are also ra@@ y@@ rian game per@@ ish@@ ops who have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could walk around a door .
what is it supposed to do ?
a breakthrough occurred .
even if Smartphone Apps like Fit@@ bit could already track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sport as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and use it with time .
however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier .

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all that .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the floor .
brilliant throughout the line .
and now finally also Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast came to the multi @-@ stage title on Thursday and increased the gap between himself and the rest of the world under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
their overall result was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and Final Five &quot; team c@@ amer@@ adi@@ n A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the balance beam during the individual competition of women in the gymn@@ as@@ tics of the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual Americ@@ anist who wins a multi @-@ stage title and overall the fifth while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years , 15 world med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion from 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ on told her that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it was awaiting them a final test in Brazil , a competition that was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the ath@@ lete , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not to return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be regarded as disappointment .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , on the left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after they have won gold and silver in the individual multi @-@ marathon of women in the gymn@@ as@@ tics at the 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as ex@@ clamation mark on the farewell ceremony of the team co @-@ ordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted on never having planned the future during its long way , it is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical tum@@ bling pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
this girl , adopted as a small child by her grand@@ parents and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gym in which Bo@@ or@@ man trained , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , it has not lost a competition competition , a series of victories that will last as long as Bil@@ es wishes .
even if Must@@ af@@ ina was easy to lead through two turns , the image was dec@@ ei@@ ving .
Swedish and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ nen - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - lu@@ sted .
she got back with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the balance beam again - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor , she was sitting on it .
Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ gged her sof@@ tly when she expected her end result - pure form@@ ality - and tears streaming on Bil@@ es bril@@ li@@ antly red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book became a reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago , when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Must@@ af@@ ina .
this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , called &quot; O@@ ma &quot; by the Americans , had a lead .
after her ground exercise she threw down c@@ us@@ cu@@ es to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as far as Bil@@ es is concerned , the rapidly spreading T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a completely new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims shot in serial killer case when listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl killed in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and listened to music .
Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis subsidiary Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand @-@ fired weapon , while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police reported that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder did not seem to have been the result of a pre@@ dat@@ or , as the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims .
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting seduc@@ ed the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they were associated with four previous attacks .
in total , within four months , seven people were killed and two more injured in His@@ panic residential neighbor@@ hoods within four months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ance from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence they concluded that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis subsidiary Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which was dump@@ ed on an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and from which it is assumed that it was the factory of serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge shells and secured a sphere from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 year old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it becomes better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but as the least of his contem@@ por@@ aries Ed@@ mund micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy .
when he came home for the first time , my first thought was that I couldn &apos;t do it .
I can &apos;t do that .
I didn &apos;t let myself on that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is wrong at all -- of course you have let yourself into it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Vincent and her were told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize her and that he might not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alize him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people are still doing &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund was neither able to sit nor craw@@ l up to his third year of life and he can still not speak .
but it is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and bike rides .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund has imagined for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing me something &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring him drawing language , &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the ci@@ ca@@ virus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of infected infected with the virus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t really know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the forecast for a long time , because I didn &apos;t expect it to really tell me anyone .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for babies of babies with birth defects caused by the ci@@ ca@@ virus .
it will be better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy ra@@ ins , floo@@ ding gives reason to rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy ra@@ ins and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call on the emergency stand on Friday .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flooded their banks and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , the National Weather Service reported .
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards announced that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and help the communities affected .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for high water vehicles , boats and sand bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that the community of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , alone , had asked tens of thousands of sand bags .
a flood warning system is used across large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service reported that there could be an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood warning system was deployed on Friday , while it was still ra@@ ining in the mobile area .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the Am@@ ite river near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , are likely to reach record levels all over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that an up@@ stream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish poses a danger , as these rivers are slowly flowing over the tro@@ dden rivers into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w river , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi River border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , already reached the highest level on Friday at 9 a.m. , which was ever recorded .
rescue teams still shr@@ ank people from floo@@ ding in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y H@@ ans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were rescu@@ ed from Glo@@ ster on Friday .
H@@ ans@@ ford , 62 , says that Be@@ aver Creek water , which is normally more than 400 feet from his house , rise above night .
he said that another step @-@ in @-@ son who lives nearby had warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water flo@@ ated and flo@@ cked in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ ans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife told H@@ ans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there .
H@@ ans@@ ford said he and his family members had all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
H@@ ans@@ ford said No@@ thel@@ fer had saved all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommodated until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the floo@@ ding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had spread rapidly because there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities considered evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer contacted Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the ground was well balanced by rainf@@ all since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy ra@@ ins and road floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and the lesson in five school districts .
the C@@ BS affiliate WW@@ L reported that an or@@ derly in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa attacked 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches which were both flooded .
the leader of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had rescu@@ ed 72 people and seven pets , washed by the floods .
in the towns of Am@@ ber@@ e and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were furnished to accommodate the evacu@@ ated people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water begins to go back , they will be able to go back to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of roads were closed due to high water and sand bags were provided for the residents to take the water out of their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last major floo@@ ding we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ pp , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his information , a handful of houses on Thursday were reported to have been reported in@@ und@@ ated , but no reported on Friday .
Keith Tow@@ n@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tow@@ n@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; pier@@ ced by bul@@ lets , &quot; survived shooting in Philadelphia
the police announced that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child was shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents indicated that Brown suffered several shot injuries , including in the loin , leg , arm , and abdom@@ en , but that he was in hospital with his transport to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has gone through a lot , his little body was pier@@ ced by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ de@@ z to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just can &apos;t believe it .
the condition of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the transmitter that he is expected to recover .
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
Brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found at the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical condition , shot at , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether one of the injured men could be the cul@@ pr@@ its .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that it apparently had come to a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
cartridge shells for assault rif@@ les , which were traced back to various assault rif@@ les , were crow@@ ding the scene of the crime .
it seems that this has been a definite struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , there were po@@ ds .
in this way , several armed comb@@ at@@ ants seem to have been involved , who were very actively involved , &quot; said police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the Philadelphia Police .
several houses and vehicles were also met in the area .
there was no arrest and the police are re@@ port@@ edly checking the surveillance video .
another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a qu@@ ag@@ ger on Tuesday when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .
she re@@ covers himself and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I present to myself under the women &apos;s olymp@@ i@@ onship in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that for more than one reason .
first of all , since 1984 I have been part of every summer Olympics and the USA have never been so dominant .
and second , this team has three female gymn@@ asts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin colors .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess , and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , which is ca@@ tho@@ lic , makes everybody proud .
this crew finally reflects the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and his@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one among female female gymn@@ asts was an Af@@ ro @-@ American woman .
last year , Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprise Olympic med@@ d@@ man and America che@@ ered .
now the world has been able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ly gy@@ mas@@ tics routines .
on Thursday , Sim@@ one became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual Americ@@ anist who won gold at an individual multi @-@ stage event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won Silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but gymn@@ as@@ tics in the whole country do not look like this .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to make it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four female players in the team . in addition , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that gymn@@ as@@ tics is an expensive sport and Tur@@ ner is primarily involved in private sports clubs which are maintained by parents who come up for training , training , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) .
the majority of these gymn@@ as@@ tics lie in wealthy suburbs that can support the business .
in these clubs , the gymn@@ asts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes since they started the gymn@@ as@@ tics .
we have to get inspired by countless young girls inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , offering a more affordable and easily accessible gymn@@ as@@ tics training .
I founded my 20 @-@ year institution .
at my events we offered free and affordable Tur@@ ns in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban you@@ ths ( especially black and His@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics that deserve the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport .
gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it &apos;s the inspiration of this team that attracts thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in the sport , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this genuine portra@@ yal of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the Olympic team gold and thanks , so many young girls with different backgrounds are motivated to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistant doctors want to organize further strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 assistance practitioners who voted in favour of voting declined .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in July , Hun@@ t had unveiled plans to introduce the Treaty and said that the N@@ HS had been found in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No Man &apos;s Land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first assistance physicians are to receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekend supplements in order to improve maintenance at un@@ ast@@ ral times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , chair@@ woman of the BM@@ A committee for assistance practitioners , announced last night in a message saying : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assistance physicians have serious concerns about the proposed treaty , in particular that it will pre@@ heat the current occupation crisis and treat it to treat all physicians fairly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and the time runs out .
efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to resolve disputes by convers@@ ing with the government strug@@ gled to participate and sometimes de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this was one of the promises Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had made last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , lift up the vibration and address the worries of the assistance practitioners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he fails to do so , the assistance physicians have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work combat measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a delay of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were included to provide coverage for doctors on the strike chain .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A would like to provide a better weekly pay for the 5@@ 4.000 practitioners who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS employee , called on the assistance physicians to end the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour action measures do not reach little , but strain already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare patients , nur@@ ses and their families only worries , need and interruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the past two months , we have spoken to the committee of assistance practitioners and responded positively to the concerns about guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower with the ministry of health and other mini@@ stries .
the employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training sessions , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holidays and the gender @-@ specific wage differential in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health related to the compliance with the BM@@ A agreements in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day drug that can reduce heart attack risks
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug after being recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the drug is administered after a heart attack for 12 months , reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attack .
N@@ ICE , the N@@ HS regulatory body , recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
N@@ ICE , the N@@ HS regulatory body , recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
about 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of it is suffering from another heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form floor@@ ings .
when the flooring breaks apart , it can cause a blood c@@ lot that stops the flow of blood to the heart and thereby causes a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots dissolve , it can flow through the flow of blood and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons who had already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk to have another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely .
the draft Bill of N@@ ICE , which was published today recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who have suffered a heart attack have a further heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in combination with aspir@@ in to reduce further heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack .
by a provisional recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who benefit .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness cultiv@@ ates electoral fraud in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ let Lut@@ ry Rah@@ man was removed last year due to corruption from ministry due to corruption
a culture of political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to widespread ignor@@ ing of widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities as a devastating government report today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally attacks the police , election observers and town coun@@ cils to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former minister of integration and local government , who is now an antagon@@ ist king , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious subjects would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside election cabins to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should have an identification with themselves in order to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present , a vot@@ er only has to name his name and address .
the report proposes not to apply removable ink to the finger of a person if they give up their vote in order to prevent someone choosing twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , Sir Eric says .
he calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions of un@@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this serves not only against electoral fraud , but also to protect the local government from the broader anti @-@ corruption and financial investment culture associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Dow@@ ning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets electoral campaign in the east of London .
last year , a special electoral court ruled that the inc@@ umbent mayor Lut@@ ry Rah@@ man should be reli@@ eved of illegal and illegal practices of his office after a lit@@ any .
the court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the consequence of an im@@ itation in which one person was chosen as someone else .
Sir Eric said that there is evidence of fraud in the whole country .
in particular , he vo@@ iced alarm for the frau@@ dul@@ ent choice of letters when the older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to elect a candidate of their election .
Sir Eric , depicted , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including leading expressions to prove the identity
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his report it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was indicated that pressure was exer@@ ted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people , to choose according to the will of the elders , especially communities with Pakistan or Banglad@@ es@@ hi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there have been concerns that ... state institutions have unknow@@ ingly ignored such behaviour as a result of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said fifty recommendations to clean the system , including the ban that political activists edit letters of mail to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election harvest &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report envis@@ aged by Ther@@ esa May also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral index being used for immigration and social fraud purposes .
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
non removable ink on the finger of a person use as soon as it has left its voice to prevent someone choosing twice .
systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are optional .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for automatic letter selection .
ban that political activists edit complete envel@@ opes and envel@@ opes from local sel@@ ections .
the police have the authority to set off barriers to election stations .
a change of law that facilitates an accus@@ ation of in@@ timi@@ dation following the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Represent@@ ative Act 1983 ) .
prohibition of photography in election stations .
requirement that only English should be used in the election stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the employees generally accepted that voters themselves walk into the electoral cabin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric strikes the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let case there was no complaint . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral court has declared Lut@@ ry Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons he was found guilty for a number of reasons - in accordance with the high requirements of criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check checks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the city coun@@ cils &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electoral law &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country has a proud heritage as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the Olympic Games 2016 in Rio have passed this week on the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , who has proved to be an impressive doppel@@ gan@@ ger of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic champion is by far not the only ath@@ lete who has his own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger this summer - at least not if one is allowed to believe the social media .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that spark@@ le at the time on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympi@@ ans that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the hunter and the wolf : team member of the U.S. squ@@ ad in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , has been compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood
in addition to K@@ ate &apos;s Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the rac@@ et@@ rack , many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher could be the Di@@ dy@@ mus of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the U.S. team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has created a storm on Twitter after pictures on which he looks like the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself do not see any great simil@@ arity , with the exception of facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy , the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good @-@ looking guy , so I think it &apos;s a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British female jum@@ per Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her big expressive eyes is said to be a doppel@@ gan@@ ger for the Cuban American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one course higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ mann , who has similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal s@@ wimm@@ ers Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mo@@ va has more than just the sun@@ tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans to resem@@ ble an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar visual form and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others have noticed the simil@@ arities
theory put into space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the pair
a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an unbeliev@@ ably similar visual form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons included Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney , as well as the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ ns Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own beautiful , wide smile , similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese flo@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds Analysis of the fourth place of the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Yan@@ is at dr . 4x@@ 200m Frei@@ sta@@ floating staff@@ el ou@@ tra@@ ged viewers of the C@@ BC live broadcast of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ ical Games on Wednesday
the Canadian broad@@ caster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; like M@@ ief &quot; and during the race like &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off when at the end of the 4x@@ 200m outdoor swimming relay his own opinions were given off .
Mac@@ don@@ ald , who was brought on board in the C@@ BS comment@@ ator team to give more &quot; colour , &quot; could be heard : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese girl has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , he went down like a low , died like a pig .
thank you for that .
the Chinese flo@@ ater Ai Yan@@ is , 14 , sp@@ un the second stage of the squ@@ ad@@ ron scale 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled the Canadi@@ ans to close the gap to China .
viewers across Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were shocked by the sound and the language
&quot; &quot; &quot; twe@@ ete , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The C@@ BC comment@@ ator has just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old s@@ wimm@@ ers from China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot didn &apos;t realize that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai Yan@@ an of China has been described as a woman in the final 4 x 200m outdoor swimming relay for women : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old female Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald &apos;s criticism on Twitter came quickly and hard , many of whom were talking about him
Twitter users did not stay back when they heard how un@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald was
another Twitter user Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let us all look like ra@@ cists .
a short time later , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast live for the commentary by Mac@@ Donald , said : &quot; we are sorry that the commentary was broad@@ cast@@ ed on floating power . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC at the end ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times among the people who responded to the B@@ emer@@ is about Twitter
the comment@@ ator colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
yesterday night we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers on air and on our fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ ies in the social media .
to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not on it as a person .
yet they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wording . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry .
Mac@@ don@@ ald was ap@@ ologi@@ zing on Thursday afternoon and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention to be interpreted as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the Women &apos;s Flo@@ od Squ@@ ad@@ ron in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ ism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have referred to the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not on it as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged by a woman who sham@@ elessly under@@ wear in the middle of the business
the buyers didn &apos;t know where to look , when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a Pri@@ mark to try under trousers .
to wor@@ sen the situation she looked at her as she looked at it , pulled her out and put her back into the Shel@@ f .
they continued to rum@@ mage and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark store at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone in which the woman rehear@@ sed the pants before putting them back into the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , &quot; she went back and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area she took off a pair of pants from the out@@ lay , with@@ drew her own sten@@ oses and pants and tasted her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a somewhat dis@@ crete place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she with@@ drew the pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put her back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three other pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , went back and out .
&quot; it didn &apos;t seem to bo@@ ther anyone watching - or thinking about the person who might buy the pants that she had tried . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How obj@@ ection@@ able is that someone would take shelter with someone who had another person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident took place on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I received , the staff tried to pull the garments out of the sale after it went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of pants and find out that another woman had her and pulled out and didn &apos;t wash her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday August 9 at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect yourself from weapon attacks with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com video could make it a bit safer for you .
we talked with Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York , to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer for your rob@@ ber .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you are approaching from behind you should turn as first to see your attack@@ er and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go out of the firing line , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
then strike it with the knee in the bar and twist , while the aggres@@ sor bows against pain , the weapon from his hands . strike it with the barrel in the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on it .
with attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot , grab the gun and twist it , so that the Att@@ acker can &apos;t shoot .
at the same time , shift the weight to the weapon and hit the aggres@@ sor on the chest , then twist the weapon out of its handle before they move backwards and raise the weapon to it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it pre@@ acts Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that at a rob@@ ber@@ y it is the saf@@ est way to hand over your money - unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
travel@@ er Ian W@@ right sh@@ ab@@ t for a travel guide his tongue in the dir@@ ti@@ est places of Europe
a British trav@@ eller stri@@ pped his immune system and the th@@ resh@@ ing of a serious test - by dra@@ gging some of Europe &apos;s dir@@ ti@@ est and disgu@@ sting places .
the present@@ er and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k dis@@ da@@ ined his course on a euro note , a hand@@ rail at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a flush @-@ mounted toilet and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before the lick of every object , he used a lumin@@ ous to show himself and us what he is going to get in .
but the experiment , which was in@@ filtr@@ ated under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to light .
the idea of removing the ush@@ ing button of a pulling toilet that has been used by thousands of others may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals on the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately , nothing he li@@ cked up left more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his bow@@ els by travelling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things .
from public money stations to railway stations to r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ bs of toilets , the task set up his immune system definitely below a sample
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film , he was justified in his call .
the only thing he le@@ aned was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial model showed a lumin@@ omet@@ ry number of more than 4000 units .
by comparison , the lumin@@ omet@@ ry number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to lick off after its lumin@@ omet@@ ry number exceeded 4000 units while fresh washed hands exhibit one of less than 60 .
Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; showing the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is close to the worst thing I have sm@@ elled in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dish@@ on@@ or than that !
I &apos;m not going to lick here anything , because here it is disgu@@ sting inside .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biotics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we conducted crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended with saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s call Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them in a greater context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I lost my respect for Ian , if he had tasted some of the things I had told him to lick , just like the faulty Russian toilet , which is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick her and others where this was pretty difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 84 percent of all respon@@ dents lac@@ tic acid bacteria associated with the well being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that they use at least occasional products containing added lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
A@@ Social family destro@@ ys del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left its social housing after a del@@ o@@ ge with a damage of £ 50,000 , because it terr@@ orized their neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ ly have been thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after being forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls had holes , wooden boards were torn , garbage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was s@@ me@@ ared on the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that it now lives in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the property management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she was afraid that the apartment could not be repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property is thought to be considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is likewise .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror which the family had inflic@@ ted on street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking , and excessive write , quar@@ rels and cur@@ ses included .
Skel@@ by , 47 , whose name was on the lease , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house , which will be demol@@ ished under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
in the estate , where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden plan@@ ks were torn
neighbours mentioned that they had to fight them on the street and had to call the police regularly .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ o@@ oned her and her partners this week forci@@ bly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ u@@ ge was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said that their life was made hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t bo@@ ther anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years apart from them and it was always bad .
the countless times we hear the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this morning we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now that they are finally gone , it will become beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said it had ab@@ hor@@ red the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called at regular intervals , for 20 years
on the over@@ grown site of the community house rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family , as a dele@@ tion is always the last step into account of Corn@@ wall housing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behavior was extreme and their deeds had to be horrible for their neighbours .
I appreciate all the work my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and gave us the information .
I hope that this development will provide comfort to some neighbors and the message con@@ veys that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ ving onto the floor
workers of house administration will have to evacu@@ ate garbage mountains that surround the house
in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as gar@@ ages , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ by received a fine after it had ple@@ aded guilty to the possession of a class B drug in commercial for@@ bear@@ ance .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ by , who died in 2013 in a car accident .
after they were without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many room walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ led with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say that it will navigate ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police reported that del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can act without self @-@ reproach and those who have been har@@ med by such behaviour &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate illegal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal moved to panic after an eff@@ ec@@ tual military jet over@@ flies beach
sun worshi@@ ppers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
a portu@@ guese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft of the Air Force took an incredible dive
the Air Force said it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that there was no safety hazard .
this was the moment when sc@@ ared tourists start to panic after an eff@@ ec@@ tual jet crashed over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military plane flew close to the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the holi@@ day@@ makers sprang up when they understand@@ ably started to worry about the noise of the dam@@ s , without seeing what was coming up through the clouds .
the incident took place yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers posted on the dramatic F@@ ly @-@ By in social media , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it flew very low twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt as if the plane would fall on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were terri@@ fied when the plane came out of darkness and flew unbeliev@@ ably deep .
the Portuguese air forces announced today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify f@@ isher boats off the coast and had to fly so low that this was the only way to recognize them .
the spokes@@ man said that due to the poor visibility the aircraft flew lower than usual due to the poor visibility conditions , but the air forces insi@@ sted that safety was at no time at risk .
area fires destroyed this summer parts of the Portuguese mainland , where four people on Madeira island came to death .
the Portuguese air forces announced today that the pilot had to fly so low because of the circumstances - strong fog and smoke smoke , which limited his visibility
the plane was on a training flight , where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise

Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step in the new football season on Sunday .
the Catal@@ ans compete in du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup against FC Sevilla , the bac@@ kl@@ ash increases three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ winner must abst@@ ain from eating with the inferior cup@@ fin@@ alist and reig@@ ning Europa League champion among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who den@@ ies the Olympic soccer tournament with Brazil .
there is also a lack of Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen .
the German suffered a change of lig@@ ament in the training in the training , with which the demand for Bar@@ ca was clari@@ fied at least for the time being in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen vie for the status as number one in Barcelona for two years .
coach Luis En@@ rique reli@@ ed on a clear decision in this respect and left Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen in the majority of the remaining applications .
before the first obligatory play of the new season , the Spanish master doubts about the fitness of the team , who was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game from Liverpool at 0 : 4 .
also at 3 : 2 at the Pro@@ beg@@ al@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. didn &apos;t really know how to convince .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sevilla , again , has the 2 : 3 defeat after an extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and aims for the second triumph at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ma Long in a separate league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old celebrated his fellow country@@ man and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro .
the World R@@ ank@@ ers first took the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ al@@ Tournam@@ ent and even Olympia .
bronze went to Japanese J@@ un Mi@@ zu@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the title to each other .
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would take the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top Olympic @-@ podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sentences and time @-@ outs , they had no coaches with them .
they had withdrawn into the tri@@ b@@ une and left their prot@@ é@@ g@@ gles on their own in a fair competition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the matches until here I played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the final , I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang had said .
after the match , gold and silver med@@ alists were awarded with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
Ma had to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first movement .
after that he set the pace on the plate and left Z@@ hang from there only a total of 13 points .
the su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of Ma did not develop the expected ro@@ using match .
nevertheless , there were enough breathtaking ball@@ changes to be seen .
Mi@@ zu@@ ani won the game for bronze at the 40 @-@ year old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the German European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the White Russian had a ri@@ pp@@ le injury . after that , it was in medical treatment that &quot; ultimately &quot; had to settle with sheet metal .
the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) were , by the way , at Olympia @-@ Vi@@ erte in a similarly high table tennis table .
Donald Tr@@ ump destro@@ ys &quot; huge problems &quot; in the election campaign
the leadership of the US re@@ public@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative states .
presidential candidate , Donald Tr@@ ump , gave short@@ com@@ ings of his election campaign in the former Republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the typically large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confi@@ dently appearing Mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire vo@@ iced something like concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported .
after throwing 16 ri@@ vals in his own Republi@@ can camp out of the race , doubts start growing in the fight for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump in front of evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in major states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fault was false reports on his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media sni@@ pp@@ et .
w@@ ob@@ ble repub@@ li@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds
U@@ tah is usually a safe bank for Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
according to a survey conducted by Surv@@ ey@@ US from June , Tr@@ ump and his rival from the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , were equal .
other institutes see Tr@@ ump in front , but not by the distance common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state .
there are also Arizona and Georgia as endangered .
in an interview with the transmitter CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump answered the question as to how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and afterwards : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does not make anything other than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; telling the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it was not sufficient for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , that was in order , Tr@@ ump said further .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to the press reports , the Tr@@ ump party is said to have threatened to make money to support his election campaign , he should not be able to present better results .
instead of that , the Repub@@ lic@@ ans &quot; candidates would be more involved in Congress than the poor .
Olympia : tri@@ lob@@ ite fraud in dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary committee on the case .
Kenya &apos;s athletes thre@@ aten after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro Un@@ ge@@ mach .
after an attempt at dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village Kenya sent a coach to home .
the International Olympic Committee decided to immediately set up a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan official had told that the previous S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine sample under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ er in the Olympic village .
this was reported to the leadership of Kenya by the D@@ oping Contro@@ ll@@ ers .
the IA@@ AF world association has requested the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to ex@@ ert their own investigations , an IA@@ AF speaker announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IO@@ C , IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated in an IA@@ AF Declaration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) passed to the D@@ oping control station and was issued as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i , rehear@@ sed and signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained K@@ eni@@ as Chief of Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the ath@@ lete , who was on the list for training controls of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ er became World Cup fourth in 2015 over 800 meters .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics delegation leader Michael Rot@@ er had been withdrawn from the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed about pending d@@ oping tests against cash payments sports@@ men of his country .
according to media reports , he was said to have been arrested at his return to Nairobi airport .
in the IO@@ C , Kenya has been under special surveillance following numerous dop@@ ing off@@ ences for some time now .
at the announcement of the more than 2000 D@@ oping Dest@@ inations submitted by the IO@@ C before the Rio games , it was un@@ usually pointed out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia will be targeted .
the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency had exer@@ ted much pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil , to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the start of the Olympics .
as a result , the WA@@ DA Kenya accepted the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is regarded as a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won the most med@@ als at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
in a series of TV reports of the ARD , repro@@ aches have been repeatedly raised that dop@@ ing resources are easily accessible in Kenya and there is to be a substantial ment@@ ality of sport fraud .
the IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently requested a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had employed in Russian athle@@ tics .
it has been proven that this type of sport has been systematically dop@@ ed in this type of sport .
the athletes of Russia were then excluded from the summer games .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
in Shakespeare &apos;s year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic pair of love , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with this a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece .
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled with the role of Mary a youth room .
in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that she is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody .
it is a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
in this staging , Bart@@ oli plays an older Mary .
she re@@ members with melanch@@ oly her love with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
first , because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says in her song : pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so she is smart , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is very similar to me , my Italian character I have as a Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor for us to work with her .
it is an immen@@ sely generous person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an exceptional artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it &apos;s his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a joyful approach to life , that is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to date : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ ert@@ ories went to New York , and the New York residents did not want them .
they are the same topics , and they are as meaningful today as it was then .
59 years later the piece is still relevant .
London school@@ girl , who joined the IS , was killed in Syria
Ka@@ di@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school@@ girls leaving London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria .
Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e , a lawyer , said that a few weeks ago her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was assumed that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the Boll@@ ywood group in the country , reported I@@ TV news on Thursday .
Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and died , according to her family , shortly after she pre@@ tended to leave the war@@ med land and return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good lies in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said .
in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other school girls from the east of London came to Turkey heading for a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she had married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and within a few months she became a widow .

Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ land &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will nom@@ inate the successor of the de@@ ceased judge in the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Rei@@ d said during a telephone conference that he expected from Clinton to select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he had not yet spoken to Clinton whether she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulate .
he praised Gar@@ land and said , Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Court judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; RAID said Republi@@ can blocked Gar@@ land &apos;s nom@@ ination were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack@@ eys &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also stated that Donald Tr@@ ump is un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
Tre@@ ats wants to make nude calendar for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine co@@ operates with photographer David Bel@@ le@@ urs in order to bring out a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses calendar for 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of this year , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us that his nude magazine distinguishes itself from classic school play@@ boys as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he believes that it does the calendar too .
&quot; we have to return to the representation of timeless and classical n@@ ak@@ edness , in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release for the publication of the calendar .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful piece of art .
models can submit their pictures online or in person at the open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community anticip@@ ates mass flight
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who is not adapting and pra@@ ising Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ Stiftung Dialog und Welt &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the short term , the Kur@@ dist@@ an Community of Germany anticip@@ ates tens of thousands of asylum seekers fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , it could even be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; believes the president of the Union Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the hard he@@ gemon@@ y of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , after the attempted coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany anticip@@ ates mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term , with several hundred thousand asylum seekers from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdo@@ gan regime op@@ poses the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government had already sur@@ rendered Kurdish high bur@@ sts with punishment months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds in Turkey were fle@@ eing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the th@@ war@@ ted put@@ sch , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks were added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to restart in Europe if they continue to be supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that receives refugees from their own country produces refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the association compla@@ ined of the deliber@@ ate settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ vi@@ tic cities .
in this way , Erdo@@ gan hopes to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradic@@ ated or expelled in the last hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Union of Le@@ aders demanded that the German government be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in Germany , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critic is taking place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the past few months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more Turks are seeking asylum in Germany , above all Kur@@ ds and op@@ position@@ ists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire mark as Gü@@ len @-@ trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; those who do not adapt and praise Erdo@@ gan , sit on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ular@@ es , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ Stiftung Dialog and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as reported by the newspaper under appeal to figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks already presented the largest group of asylum @-@ holders recognized for political persecution in Germany before the coup .
as of June 30 , these were 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people , and thus nearly 29 percent of all recognised as a Y@@ EA@@ R ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this elevation there is no reward for war , poverty or lack of prospects .
the right to asylum in accordance with the Basic Law is exclusively political , i.e. , by the state , individually persecuted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals do not get anything from the summer campaign with - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia cannot choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania they understood .
in 2021 , the Parliament election will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
because it &apos;s not stupid as before : summer holidays , heat and land@@ slide competition - that bites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the locals who want to be convinced by the election fighters are on vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers traveling in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so you should not choose the Land@@ tag .
there are practical problems : during the holidays hel@@ pers who hang up posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and count the votes in the end , only work hard .
until September 4 , 2016 , the electoral and final holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern once again has to pass election campaign close to the people .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s all about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys .
exciting is how strongly newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts and what remains in the end co@@ ali@@ tions du@@ sty .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from his big posters .
he travels through the countryside , distri@@ butes roses and chat a little with the people , just as his legendary elo@@ qu@@ ent predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff also did .
otherwise , seaf@@ ering has got cold feet and chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel to blame for the blos@@ som@@ ing of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accelerated the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U , with its top candidate , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced what it is like to make election campaign at the wrong time at the right place .
she invited chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale environments ; Merkel &apos;s constitu@@ ency is located in the north @-@ east .
but the target group didn &apos;t agree , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Western Pom@@ er@@ ania .
&quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; compla@@ ined Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in N@@ DR .
but it &apos;s too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
apart from that , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U largely refra@@ ins from the usual election campaigns at market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with paras@@ ols and ballo@@ ons .
that , says Kok@@ ert , only plays a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot;
the Union also noted that in the country you are crum@@ bling on the ground that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people .
as the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens , you hardly find it in the sides of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the advice of the CD@@ U vot@@ er Kok@@ ert to his comrades is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must go where it hur@@ ts , namely , where the people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering called his SPD to a particularly committed campaign .
in poll@@ s , the Socialists and Democrats finally posted 22 percent behind CD@@ U ( 25 ) partners and just margin@@ ally ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the election of 2011 , the SPD gained a clear margin of 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , are likely to make a leap into the Land@@ tag .
they make a modern virtue out of the necessity of holiday and largely transfer their campaign to the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; calls it the president of the country Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , green elec@@ tors embar@@ k on search for traces of local voters among the holi@@ day@@ makers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , just curves with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it even beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electoral holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Ren@@ ov@@ ation : restaurants suffer from blocking
at the speed with which the B 27 is renovated , there is nothing to complain about .
for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and only end at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning , there is always praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they &apos;ve done everything pretty cris@@ py , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the Jet petrol station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super team .
there is also no delay .
the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south as planned at the beginning of the week , and everything will be ready by the end of October .
the receipt of the work for the construction works is also v@@ owed , for example when it comes to the establishment of emergency services .
since the construction site had mig@@ rated to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ don@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and thus also the connection to Rot@@ tenburg , the traffic situation within the place has relaxed .
the citizens can now move from O@@ don@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the ev@@ asive movement through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were some considerable problems , &quot; said Florian King , the head office manager responsible for the transport management of the refurb@@ ishment .
the residents of Bach@@ mann@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many Sch@@ leich@@ ero@@ oms were looking for and rather trusted their Nav@@ i as the sign@@ posting .
what led to the fact that some trucks were fr@@ ing@@ ed in residential areas .
as the speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the community demanded ampli@@ fied the M@@ ös@@ singen ground vehicle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were significant exagger@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself informed about the situation on the spot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute have already been scored .
the fastest was at 77 kilometres per hour in the Tempo @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
since the construction site has moved on , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business people at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg the road is now open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 refurb@@ ishment has led to revenue out@@ breaks , allows everyone to look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are therefore produced for other companies , for which the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; even at the deal@@ er@@ ship Ma@@ ier , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maximum slight decline &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also ad@@ mits that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; natural history is missing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most popular are the bars along the street .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential threat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only him but all the restaurants have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must be happy about every euro turnover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the revenue losses he reduced to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the street structuring has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrown back &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to leave half of his employees .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , District President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from G@@ öh@@ ner if there is a financial compensation , with the hint that the restaurant profits otherwise from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 . now , it must also bear the disadvantages that result from the renovation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where something more generous was handled .
with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , pointing to the long history .
the fact that other regular guests are now less frequently missed due to complicated traffic guidance , he can understand .
if you can &apos;t drive , it is also elsewhere nice .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt that his family clientele returns after the refurb@@ ishment works .
despite the crises with BSE and avi@@ an flu , G@@ öh@@ ner thinks the impact of the B 27 construction works on his clientele for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its many years of history .
six months of construction work , that &apos;s brutal .
it is constantly bol@@ ted to laws in the name of comb@@ ating terrorism .
following the latest proposals , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a thick security package .
but what has to do with terror status ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the Rec@@ on@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they do not inv@@ ade anyone .
other , out@@ going points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also participate in this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , as Minister of the Interior , he was on the basis of results and in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère has missed a little time before he presents his conclusions for security in the Republic .
but these are all the more extensive .
a lot has already been announced , announced , announced , that a new security agency should take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and weapons legislation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security agencies is not surprising as well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère starts a second campaign for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants to punish sympathy recru@@ iting for terrorist groups and kno@@ ck jihadi@@ sts with double nationality the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U ad@@ mits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , he thinks this is reasonable and does not demand anything that has no chance whatsoever with the coalition partner anyway .
a few new ideas are being presented by de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
they have it in part : he plans quick methods for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ain@@ ing people from deportation .
refugees who are targeted at the country should be able to check their smartphones and reveal social media accounts for security checks .
in the case of de@@ ple@@ tion for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some worse positions than to date - such as comm@@ itting criminal off@@ ences or deliberately throwing away their documents in order to obsc@@ ure their identity .
some of it is politically and legally .
many things also seem to be sp@@ un off and leave questions un@@ answered .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of tolerated , for example - the question arises : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to differentiate between refugees and terror . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in addition , many people worried about security in the face of the high numbers of refugees .
and things that were deeply concerned with people could not be cl@@ inging out even during election campaign periods .
the focus is on inner security .
first the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Union and SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the subject of internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past few days , the two parties went up high .
only a gar@@ ant@@ y argument about the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the department heads also demand a bur@@ q@@ a ban and a return from the dual citizenship .
here , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also struggling with conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
he doesn &apos;t stop from a departure from the double pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have fixed the discussion in Germany on a temporary basis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it does not make sense to re@@ vo@@ ke them .
and in case of a bur@@ q@@ a ban , he has constitutional obj@@ ections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether his own package is constitutional and whether it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ tions partner has yet to be shown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a lot of things to do in the fight .
but the SPD is currently attempting to profile itself on the subject of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel clearly signals willingness to talk and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen is still going through .
deliveries are rising worldwide despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als .
but it doesn &apos;t work in all markets .
in the recall action there is vor@@ tex about a term .
Volkswagen will start deliveries in the second half of the year .
despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can still advance a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ run markets .
but in July , the VW core brand weakened especially in Western Europe and thus loaded the total sales , as reported in the company listed in the Da@@ x .
in July , the VW brand sold only 1.8 percent fewer vehicles worldwide than in the previous year &apos;s month with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars .
in Western Europe alone , after China was the second @-@ largest market , sales were 14 percent below the prior @-@ year figure .
in Germany &apos;s home market , deliveries dropped by almost one sixth .
brand sales manager Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there has been a purchase restra@@ int in some core markets by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on the exit from the EU also imp@@ acted a spokes@@ woman .
in the USA , where the exhaust @-@ gas sc@@ aff@@ old first escal@@ ated , a minus is also available .
the Chinese market is a great support for Volkswagen .
all in all , the most affected branch of the Nieder@@ sachsen is already margin@@ ally affected by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an extra@@ dition of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available .
group sales director Fred Kap@@ pler was able to advance a sales platform from January to July .
at this time , Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had tam@@ pered with a software exhaust test .
in Germany alone , VW is calling approximately 2.5 million cars for retro@@ fitting into the workshops .
in the course of retro@@ fitting , Volkswagen confirmed that the conversion of the cars had no negative effects .
after the conversion of the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after retro@@ fitting , the car manufacturer adverti@@ ses a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , but does not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as it was said on Friday in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is legal fin@@ esse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen is now granting its German customers a guarantee for upgraded diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have been confirmed last Monday by VW @-@ representative at the Federal Ministry of Transport .
it was confirmed by the Ministry of Transport that this meeting was held .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW is fully compl@@ ying with the requirements of my Commission of In@@ quiry and the KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deviations from this will not be accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has taken over the guarantee that there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after the conversion and all vehicle values that are relevant to the vehicle remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen self uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it meant in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers , for example , come to a workshop with an engine failure half a year after the conversion - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
even in the interests of the customer , it is important to avoid that in case of any other damage , which has nothing to do with the exhaust sc@@ andal , it comes to uncertainty about possible warranty regulations as it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands p@@ uni@@ tive interest rates from rich savers in future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , bank manager Josef Paul said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers that park 40 million euros on sight deposit or day money accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German B@@ anks speaks of an individual case and does not see it as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savers do not have to fear to pay pen@@ alties for their Au@@ sterity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if banks are spending money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.@@ 4 percent penalty .
this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund to withdraw from private and corporate customers for deposits of more than 100,000 euros in cash or day money accounts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 in the future will cost 400 euros a year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been keeping 40 million euros for some time , which could be withdrawn from one day to the next and which he could not exploit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and costs 0.4 per cent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lie for every million 4000 Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter @-@ pays principle , the costs now continue .
leaving the cash in the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Bank &apos;s saf@@ es would be far too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; said the Chief Executive Officer .
most customers would have understood and changed to other forms of investment .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the co @-@ operative association of Bavaria explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to bear them alone is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically impossible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their account management fees , credit cards or bank transfers .
the Thur@@ in@@ gian People and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Bank of Alten@@ burger Land had made head@@ lines with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 with p@@ uni@@ tive interest for deposits of three million euros .
Michael Kem@@ mer , CEO of the banking union , said : &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide fees for deposits , and the competition in Germany is far too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is a clientele in the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which is endow@@ ed with wealth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it pays for free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; currently no other banks are known to the cooperative association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who charge a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banken and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , announced at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into the negative vis @-@ à @-@ vis private customers is very , very high . &quot;
competition is tough , and there is a threat to the migration of investors to competition .

destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
lonely men of middle aged love boards .
before you ha@@ sten to the comment section , to re@@ am@@ end him under the pseu@@ don@@ ym Non @-@ Alle@@ man@@ cy of Male Dam@@ age with harsh insul@@ ts , this statement deri@@ ves from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the much discussed re@@ development of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in millenni@@ als who want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to Mid@@ life @-@ nostal@@ gia .
those who bought recently a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght at the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
it is also not hor@@ des by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older dr@@ um@@ mers tend to retain their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v right ?
if this blog was a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , wearing a modest grey suit before I stop , holding my hands and saying something like &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - still there is still a handful of fantastic record specialist shops .
I would probably ask the camera man to switch off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glas@@ gow , 55 , dem ich von Si@@ ster Ray ( data number : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of data : eight middle @-@ aged men , a woman , probably around 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I already appreciate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have about 3.000 or 4.000 records .
these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by email , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason he possesses such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records that he could not afford than they appeared and buy items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought was probably too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink so much .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers he meets on the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pupp@@ y , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are forced to buy their old records again .
from the conversations that I have conducted , people usually get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the supposed emotional meaning of records ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica , to realize that record shops offer a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers accepted the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record sleeves , from items that evo@@ ke happy memories of youth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of empt@@ iness or possessions of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is like a collector so and I think that it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an employee fli@@ rts from a stack of plates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey by IC@@ M in April revealed that nearly 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not yet heard them .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use while 7 % of those who buy a record have no record player .
at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried as I fl@@ atten out a stack of Bos@@ sa nov@@ a comp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( number of people : three middle @-@ aged men ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; someone came just recently and said , &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound record so I can put them into the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less musi@@ c@@ astic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones who are only slowly coming in .
F@@ op@@ p , which has dedicated the records almost an entire floor , has a b@@ lower audience than I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age and middle @-@ aged women .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above mentioned stores - Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s newest syn@@ thesizer and sex@@ tary pop instead of experimental jazz from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks very lonely , but stress@@ ful psychological trauma is hard to detect if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the store for a few minutes and looks at the variety of records available for sale .
she rather makes a shop window than a big shopping .
it doesn &apos;t deserve much , so collecting records is not a real option , she says .
it costs much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she drives away with a de@@ ar@@ ted si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I am preten@@ ding to smu@@ ggle the jeans @-@ hot pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls group@@ ing for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a ley record player .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of plates from Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could ship to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain .
it is no surprise that a population group , who has more time and money than others , is the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as records .
although my research has shown that the results of You@@ Go@@ v are right , at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , they dis@@ regard the large number of female collectors that exist in reality , record shops and online forums .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they will certainly not spend their Thursday mor@@ nings with mar@@ bles through records of Ber@@ wick Street and the sheets by plat@@ ters , while they avoid the star@@ ing look of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false moder@@ ator who rises above the shoulders of no middle @-@ aged men .

French court re@@ jects offer on demo@@ lition of shops in the refugee camp
a French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live .
during a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary shops in which individuals within the camp would sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , offer hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture argued that these places were to be broken down because they would constitute a parallel economy out of which no taxes would be paid and which contain a fire and san@@ ity risk .
humanitarian groups told the Court that the shops and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also stated that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people running the 72 temporary businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture were &quot; absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that grocery stores , cafés and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely feeding people living &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas offer quiet meetings between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the collapse was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is operated in general and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as a consultation on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 170@@ ,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children of a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two relief organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of migrants living in the jungle camps had risen to over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number so far - after a steep increase of newcom@@ ers during the summer .
despite Olympia @-@ disappointed : Martin remains milit@@ arily

&quot; I keep looking at the World Cup at a glance , remain confident and keep on fighting , &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook .
he does not have an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place on the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hon@@ estly think it is hard to comment on the timing of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to analyse in silence what reasons would have led to the de@@ bac@@ le .
Martin wanted to fight for the title at the World Cup in Qatar in October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also counts my position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the triple @-@ time world champion who lost on Wednesday at 5@@ 4.5 km more than three minutes to the Olympic champion Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;

watching other people watching video games is a huge trend - Microsoft also wants to benefit from it .
the technology group bu@@ ys the start @-@ up Be@@ am , which specializes in this hobby .
Microsoft announced on Thursday how much money flows for the take @-@ over .
Be@@ am started his offer only in January and already has more than 100,000 users .
you can watch others while playing , but grab yourself .
for example , they can rel@@ inqu@@ ish missions and counter@@ pose enemies as well as provide equipment .
the Activ@@ ision Bli@@ zz@@ ard player starts a new HD video service for the bo@@ oming world of E @-@ Sports .
on the way to the global media event , Facebook should help .

Be@@ am is integrated into the video@@ game department around the Xbox console according to Microsoft .
the market for live streaming of video games is growing rapidly .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation speed meas@@ ur@@ ers : in different federal states , including in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash units are tested , which should over@@ run tem@@ pos .
the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement tra@@ ilers of the Vit@@ ronic company from Wiesbaden can be used , for example , at accident centers , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway construction sites or to renov@@ ating bridges with temporary speed limit , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a stationary f @-@ gl@@ itter to meet the speed limit .
however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days in case of continuous measurement operations ; the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem .
laser measurement technology enables all vehicles to be recorded simultaneously across multiple tracks simultaneously .
variable speed limits as well as driving b@@ ans after time , lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the high @-@ raised condition , the trailer can be moved by car with trailer hit@@ ch according to the manufacturer .
so that it is not simply cli@@ cked , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way also shot @-@ proof outer shell disappear .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter against v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to information from Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and is now also used .
foreign authorities also flash with the new technology : recently France has ordered 100 copies , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
Britain re@@ covers silver in the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class takes gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at the 7 @-@ star rug@@ by reached an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in Fi@@ j@@ is on Thursday evening , when they were hit with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ odor@@ o Stadium in Rio .
Fi@@ ji granted a master class in handling , side @-@ step ping , back , line and ro@@ her power to win Gold - their first Olympic medal of any color .
the defeat was lost through the not too bad con@@ sol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth this day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back on them in the final .
but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in this form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least a Brit@@ on tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago , they lost every game under R@@ yan at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost one .
this flap will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji started wonderful and ki@@ cked off the attacks .
it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. as if you were running in driving buses . the World Series winners went up 5 @-@ 0 , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au ech@@ o@@ ed in the corner .
with only four minutes of playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ v@@ i added another attack from the right corner he turned .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a pi@@ vot@@ al fight against Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute , Mer@@ ath@@ alu@@ a turned a touch down in the right corner and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the re@@ started and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ tra@@ u pl@@ ung@@ ed through more weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a fool .
the transformation took a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it is like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning .
that &apos;s how it is .
GB conducted fundamental changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for a whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua passed Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant interim play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton launched an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down on the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was long in favor of the South Se@@ as , whose fans sang , wave flags and danced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ lady put the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds .
the fi@@ j@@ is sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and the UK ki@@ cked down in the law@@ ns .
earlier on the day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated 20 @-@ 5 in semi @-@ fin@@ als and Britain pushed South Africa into a tight half @-@ fin@@ als match from the race - Britain &apos;s conversion of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown got the Bo@@ ks in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a score among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant later tac@@ kling by Marcus Wat@@ son , Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side Team , secured the winning - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fight with the coach &apos;s cancer
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ inal gold than with these games , and that will mean something .
from the first stroke to the last , 220 tough p@@ ieve , which enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only those who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams , was all present when they row@@ ed for the second Olympic @-@ old in the second without a tax @-@ woman , the first women in the history of British sports , who laid such a benchmark .
her domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all her 3@@ 9th in@@ ex@@ orable use , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant female athletes who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the nature of the triumph@@ al march .
behind every gold in rowing is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who contribute to the incre@@ mental progress that make the difference and there was no one better than the trainer who did not know 30 months ago if he would survive this day at all , when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he was ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and that did it .
if you don &apos;t do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a rather bad situation .
it changes a little bit the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the interruption to a minimum if this is the right term at all .
I needed money , so I had to get better again soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran around at the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it begins .
rowing is a challenge , but it makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory her first thoughts came to Williams , who spent a nerve wre@@ cking morning doing something more than anything else and trying to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ anning , which was the captain of the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . this is perhaps a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it just repe@@ ats how much this means , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have asked for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning never lost a race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters when the teams started from New Zealand and Denmark , p@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking to make something great .
we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did .
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for 31 years exemplary care taken care of
the managing director of the water @-@ purpose association &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemplary Bavarian &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Frank@@ ish drinking water @-@ water @-@ association as a model for the big water producers .
this was the name of the Bavarian Radio Station some time ago .
little later , the Water Forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia honored the Con@@ federation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group calls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria far as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who worked for 31 years in the Zw@@ eck@@ verband employee , is 28 years as Managing Director .
he was retired at the age of 65 .
the Dr@@ inking Water Board of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brun@@ n , transports approximately 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water per year and provides 32 places and hamlet with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
the congregations are the congregations of Kirch@@ heimer , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water delivery contracts for other towns and villages .
the current chair@@ person , Breit@@ brun@@ n &apos;s mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was hired as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water line construction and maintenance work through office and organisational activities , budget@@ ing planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an outstanding event , she named the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , property purchases in the area of the new well ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the renovation of the high containers ( 1999 ) , the re @-@ purchase of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the re@@ engineering of water pipes .
there have been no stand@@ still and there have always been new additions because water means living and drinking water is the most important food .
in her lau@@ dation she commen@@ ded Gö@@ ll@@ ers loyal , reliable and correct service for over 31 years .
it has been used with a lot of heart blood for its water @-@ purpose association and it has really lived the water @-@ purpose association as if it were its own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group on nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district .
for this he received very much recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , for his part , praised Water Management Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water wart and he was a faithful cra@@ cker .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from his point of view , he described the construction of the well and the restructuring of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult operation were the tu@@ b@@ ular rup@@ ture at the high reservoir in Kirch@@ hö@@ n on a third of January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the loc@@ alities could be supplied with water .
also the supply of new brun@@ n can be maintained once because one filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .

&quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a . &quot;
when the disease had been recognized by her son , she believed that she had to die .
but the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago has come forward well and now learn in New York , where there are the best therapists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example : if I ask him something that is back two years ago , when I sang at La Scala , he remembered nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot;

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - Man shoots on a life @-@ mate
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot on Friday at 10.@@ 45 in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( Stor@@ mar@@ n district ) and killed her mort@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man himself called and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , and after him I am punished .
meanwhile , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1,80 meters in size , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a bald .
meanwhile , the police have published a photograph of him .
however , it is a couple of years old .
in the meantime , the man is wearing a bald patch .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon with him , so the police .
who sees Sven S. should call the 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship at work &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 .
the police in Lü@@ beck initially did not want to provide any information about the mur@@ dering or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims ; however , it confirmed that a human had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a Special Operations Command ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime .
steel - Licht@@ blick for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ packed and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions .
financial burdens that the industry threatened with green electricity are from the table .
it remains with the exemp@@ tion from the Renewable Energy Survey at the existing facilities for the so @-@ called self @-@ power production in the German steel industry , &quot; said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally reach after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators are replaced in the steel works is an EEG lev@@ elling of 20 percent .
but even this will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall has welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on self @-@ electricity production .
as a result , the status quo of the previous regulation is largely determined .
Gabriel &apos;s successful efforts for the steel industry are of particular importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steel is Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign , this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even with the reform of emissions trading , climate and employment targets are to be weighed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained IG Metall boss Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis of 2008 , the steel industry in Europe suffers from over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure .
in the past year , the situation further intensified as the world &apos;s largest producer of producer China threw up massive steel on the world market in view of the ailing domestic demand .
European manufacturers acc@@ use Chinese steel companies price dump@@ ing .
in the course of this spring , the situation has somewhat relaxed .
on the one hand , import duties imposed on import steel show effect , on the other hand , the economic outlook in China has increased .
it is unclear how sustainable the price pick @-@ up is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least the prices had stagn@@ ated .
the sector responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
last but not least , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp did not want to exclude the closing of individual works .
at the end of 2015 , some 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry .
in July , the German steel producers are cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Economy announced on Friday .
after a short up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May , the quantity produced was now back for the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months , the association expects an improvement in order volumes thanks to an improved order situation .
community , spirit , health : singing is good for sen@@ iors
the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp her whole life : she was a young girl in the school choir , in the Leh@@ ra@@ mt studies she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in an elderly choir .
&quot; singing brings me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and a total of living , she says .
by the way she does something good about her health and her spirit .
because S@@ ingen is a great hobby for sen@@ iors straight from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German Senior League .
most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular meetings , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
social and family structures often dissolve in old age , then a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organize oneself , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for this , sen@@ iors train deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly demand his lungs are not so fast out of the box in everyday life .
even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby .
singing often has a very special effect on older people , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Working Group of the Sen@@ iors Organ@@ iz@@ ations .
in the older generations the common singing had a much higher priority , it was part of everyday life , both in school and leisure time , she explains .
L@@ enz frequently ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people awak@@ ens many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their adol@@ escence .
with lyrics and especially melodies , people who have dementia are self @-@ den@@ ial for long @-@ lying events .
in singing , a special performance is required for the head , explains L@@ enz .
focusing simultaneously on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially older people who live alone exercise to concentrate not only on themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another positive aspect is the recognition you hear through singing in the choir , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the feeling of self @-@ esteem increases by singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I practise for a long time , I will be better and more vig@@ il@@ ant over me - this experience strengthens .
there are plenty of good reasons to start singing .
if you want to try a new hobby , don &apos;t hesitate - even if you think you have little talent , L@@ enz advises .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who can hear when a sound goes wrong ?
looking for a suitable offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ tances in a retirement home , you can simply join them .
many towns also offer over@@ views of the choirs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader .
many people &apos;s choirs may also be found on the Internet .
those who do not have access to the internet can ask the family , friends or neighbors to help with the internet research .
those who want to sing should definitely join a choir , advise H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing is good for the soul and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to any age .
cats react more sensi@@ tively than males at scre@@ ams of the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover what effect the calls of cat @-@ bears on adult animals has .
to their surprise , the mi@@ str@@ ust also did not leave the males cold - however , they always beha@@ ved immediately in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the exc@@ itation degree of k@@ itt@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys at the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
they react by ten percent faster to the sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens , who are in great need of finding out how scientists found out about the Veter@@ inary Academy and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
males react also to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always the same .
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly arous@@ ed young are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance for the males , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H .
she is the author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
in a previous study , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens scre@@ ams differ with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness .
a total of nine adult males and eight que@@ ens were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a rep@@ ut@@ ations of little ones , which were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more strongly excited k@@ itt@@ ens , who were lifted up additionally .
despite the small sample , the researchers consider their results to be meaningful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who haven &apos;t had their own offspring , react differently to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned out more quickly to the speaker when this calls played the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may possibly be con@@ genital or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men to baby no@@ ises .
some studies also showed that women were more sensitive to babies , no matter if they were mothers or not , the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ pf@@ r in Turkey .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the attempted coup attempt , an important football match will be held in Turkey .
in front of the Du@@ el of the arch rival between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
already in the im@@ position of the state of emergency after attempted coup attempt in July , the government , the everyday life of normal citizens should not be affected .
this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for attempted put@@ sch .
this is not the case before the football .
the prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former strong i@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ pf@@ r .
according to this , the addi@@ ct living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ kis@@ r should be a suppor@@ ter of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
it is true that the state of emergency , which was initially suspended for 90 days , is still valid until October , but in fact it has as good as no impact on the life of most of the Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the noc@@ tur@@ nal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan to end on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - as the whole country - divided into supporters and opponents Erdo@@ gan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially fans of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what unites the Turks in the face of dramatic experience in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ sch .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be especially important to arrive to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cologne in the past season proved its sporting value : with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first playing time as a top scor@@ er of his association .
in the final match against F@@ ener@@ b@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory hit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an outstanding way and secured the tro@@ phy to his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record champion found a conci@@ li@@ atory gradu@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the round @-@ kno@@ ck@@ out in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; will leave early in the Europa League too .
in the Southern Li@@ g it reached only sixth place .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we did it and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for master b@@ ik@@ tas , the game year was better .
thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who set the basis for the 14th title with 26 season ticket buff@@ ers as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ sten @-@ King .
this is also the reason that the fans will continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
according to the attempted coup attempt at the AC Florence , the Gom@@ ez , which was borrow@@ ed at the AC of Florence , was announced after the attempted put@@ sch because of the political situation in the country following its European holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he just needs to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club Director Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but for this the Stür@@ mer would have to be ready to ren@@ ounce approximately one third of his estimated annual salary , Or@@ man clearly stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot pay his salary in Florence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes still have med@@ als in Olympics in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
other over@@ thrown athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they are fighting in Rio for med@@ als .
the topic of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
the Russian swi@@ mmer , Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ owa , compla@@ ined about her starting right just before the games after a D@@ oping @-@ lock , was pi@@ ped out mer@@ cil@@ essly at her start ( 100 meters breast ) mer@@ cil@@ essly .
it was a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scenery : with an open smile she was still in the hall and provoked her appearance .
when he found out that she wasn &apos;t going to get gold , the audience burst into a rush of applause .
but there are still many other sports@@ men who , despite the dop@@ ing past , go to the start at the Olympic Games in Rio .
here an overview :
J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 m relay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
the Olympic champion from 2004 and ex @-@ world champion has been running even faster since his spell . he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is regarded as the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven @-@ fold world champion had to reti@@ re for a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after the pain was taken by Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after having had a strong tooth@@ ache after surgery , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended himself .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic champion , world champion of 2013 and European Champion , was positively tested for the banned stimul@@ ant drug meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic denied the capture and was closed for six months .
the four far@@ th@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great gold favor@@ i@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic Champion and twice world champion over 400 m , was tested positively in 2010 and had been locked for 21 months .
a means of penis enlargement had been responsible , moist@@ ur@@ ized Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( hammer throw , Bel@@ or@@ ussi@@ a ) : hardly an ath@@ lete has subsequently recognized so many med@@ als subsequently .
thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after it was detected in him testosterone dop@@ ing .
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to hand in Olympic @-@ silver 2004 due to ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the 2006 European title due to testosterone abuse .
he also received the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a verdict of the International Sports Court CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he ranks second in the world ranking .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record and gold @-@ favor@@ i@@ tin was tested positively until May , but may still start in Rio .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion has found evidence of taking a forbidden dietary supplement , the ban of World Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency WA@@ DA was mild and ran already on 13 July .
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stood in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she suffered wounds and had been treated in hospital , but I had already left it .
she planned her home trip in early September .
whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ umph@@ on also Austrian citizens are still unclear .
in this respect , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , says Schn@@ ö@@ ll .
Hu@@ a H@@ in , located approximately 200 kilometres south of Bangkok &apos;s capital , initially explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening in a Night@@ life .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , among them the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning two jumps went up again , and another man was killed , according to the authorities .
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket a bomb explosion was reported in the morning .
a taxi driver was injured in the det@@ onation near the popular bathing beach Pat@@ ong which was popular with holi@@ day@@ makers .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ eastern coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban cler@@ k .
according to the authorities , the explosive set went into the air in a flower bed in front of the re@@ four of the coastal police .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast , as well as in Ch@@ umph@@ on on the south @-@ east coast , demanded several injured .
it was said about a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in .
&quot; the bom@@ b@@ ings bear the same signature , &quot; said Army General Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee , Friday morning in front of journalists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect it to be a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express themselves on possible motives - but probably the acts of Muslim rebels are likely to act .
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical for the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist uprising movement or terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage which limits itself to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary , it is assumed that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days the authorities would have received confidential information on forthcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they had not been informed of the exact time and places . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is still unclear which group is hiding behind the attacks .
the police found their officials in the country to enhance security around important government buildings , airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are repeat@@ ed@@ ely smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but mostly they are not against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace used for years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
following the well @-@ known bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its surroundings .
after cl@@ ashes between the security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no necessary trips to these provinces .
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the jun@@ ta .
this also gives the military a great influence in the coming years .
Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs had been an attempt to create chaos while the country faces stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody un@@ rest , re@@ members himself to have led the kingdom again to stability and order .
however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years .
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
almost one year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stroke at a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack in the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical exercise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has come into the sights of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to several regional offices , the constitutional prot@@ ectors in the Con@@ federation have also placed the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indications for efforts against the freedom of democratic principles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how immigrants from the Islamic faith or from the Middle East are de@@ fam@@ ously de@@ fam@@ ed .
therefore we observe the movement as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration , &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s identity through alien@@ ation . &quot;
constitutional guards in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - observe the &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ arten said his authority was closely coordinated with the local authorities during the decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &apos; identical exercise &apos; attempt to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the fac@@ ul@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a grati@@ fying advertising for one &apos;s own cause .
the propaganda aims to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; recently , there have been reports from several federal states on contacts of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ arten said , he didn &apos;t have any knowledge about that .
possible contacts of this type are only relevant for the constitutional protection from a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain persons who are extrem@@ ist , will change their direction and become so extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
with a view to the significant increase in legal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugees , Ma@@ arten said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context .
but in recent years we have found that there can be righ@@ tist structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal group .
it may well be that further righ@@ tist groups or small groups are formed , which are planning attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
however , a Germany @-@ wide control of right @-@ wing terrorism is not recognizable .
the previous groups were formed on the regional level or in social networks .
worried about the fact that many attacks came to the account of people who did not appear in the right scene before .
this is the wor@@ rying .
many of the suspect in case of attacks on asylum accommodation have not been known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or followers of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a lot of people have committed crimes , which had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , which were perhaps politically in@@ different , or elected for example CD@@ U , SPD or left , which then radi@@ cal@@ ised themselves by far @-@ right wing extrem@@ ist gestures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te Bec@@ omes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
the Olympics or World Records don &apos;t always define the head@@ lines at the Olympics .
this shows the courageous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center the easily obes@@ e s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia were so slow that it could no longer be seen in the TV pictures anymore .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te was subsequently transformed into a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old termin@@ ates his free@@ wheel with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not exactly sporty figure which attracted the attention of the international media .
why does the 24 @-@ year @-@ old participate in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is being distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries more popular .
since most athletes run in Ethiopia , I just wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media referred to him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ vers of W@@ hale &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the English tab@@ loid The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only hit with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters fre@@ estyle , played no part .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; have also been drawn .
Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney .
the appearance of the bu@@ oy@@ ancy from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea was unforgettable , when he had to start alone in a race of more than 100 metres of Fre@@ estyle .
M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim only eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump does not see the threatening election defeat so narrow
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , Donald Tr@@ ump , speaks at an election campaign in Florida .
if there is nothing with the election to the US President , Donald Tr@@ ump has already an alternative vide@@ ot@@ ape .
he then drive on holiday .
if Donald Tr@@ ump loses US presidential elections in November , it wouldn &apos;t matter to him : &quot; in the end , it will either fold , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the U.S. television station CN@@ BC .
in the end , if it was not sufficient for him for reasons of political correctness , that was fine , said Tr@@ ump .
he called US President Barack Obama and the democr@@ ats of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) .
in his party , more and more resistance was formed .
post increases in trading with electric v@@ ans
an electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously great .
the post plans to sell your electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter also .
in brief , the Group intends to start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
the Post wants to offer its electric v@@ ans on the free car market as of next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been checking for months whether they are to sell their self @-@ developed street sco@@ oter with which letters and par@@ c@@ els are delivered , also to sell to other companies .
post @-@ Managing Director Jürgen Ger@@ des had said that there are always questions , for example by craftsmen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the news magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Der Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group plans to enter the mass production of the vehicles shortly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the post @-@ production factory the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift .
Ger@@ der had announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and long @-@ term a complete change@@ over to environmentally friendly vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;

G@@ FR@@ P leadership steps down after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the res@@ ign@@ ations suddenly came - but not surprisingly .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K fores@@ had@@ owed that the chair by CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann became even more uncertain the longer the successes promised by him remain .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg Market Research Group Gf@@ K : following a renewed dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of the corporate management , the world &apos;s number five in the sector faces a new beginning .
at the end of the year , G@@ FR@@ P CEO plans to leave the company .
the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert will be leaving the Supervisory Board with effect from September 12 .
the management board of the Executive Board already took over the previous Managing Board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger as of 1 September , divided the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shall officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spokes@@ man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor is found for Hart@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a reason for the res@@ ignation , the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the long @-@ term business orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details did not want to call a company spokes@@ man on Friday .
it is still unclear who will lead the market research company in the future .
in investor circles , on Friday , the shareholders were the last disappointment regarding the continued success of restructuring that had been initiated years ago .
Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K @-@ summit since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the fruits of restructuring are not to be seen even after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , any shar@@ ehol@@ ding owner will eventually become rest@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that were the case at BMW , that would also make the qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after set@@ backs in the previous quarters , the company could not stop its loss of losses in the second quarter of 2016 .
at 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales fell by 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable year @-@ earlier figure .
sales in the first half of the year tot@@ alled EUR 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million by 3.4 percent .
earnings in the second quarter imp@@ acted above all the s@@ unken company value in view of its difficult economic situation .
the company value amor@@ tis@@ ation of EUR 139 million , which was necessary in the Consumer Experience division , gave the Group a loss of 14@@ 8.2 million euros .
in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K generated a net profit of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - bus sli@@ ps in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ ble in Gra@@ ben : eight injured people
eight people were injured on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ ble ( district Aur@@ ich ) in an accident involving a coach with 43 senior passengers as passengers .
two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , condemned the police .
the 66 year old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to her specifications , had to devi@@ ate from a vice that partly ro@@ de on the counter @-@ car .
the bus desc@@ ended to the right of the street and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , as a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus on their own , &quot; she said .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and a emergency ambul@@ ance came to the scene of the accident at the provincial road 2 .
the last travellers were brought back from a regular bus to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ ble district of P@@ ew@@ all .
there they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company .
the investig@@ ators called on the truck drivers and potential witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic metre of wastewater are from October 1 , 2016 for the area of the sewage system Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ h@@ ahl 3,@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 euros ( previously 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the site in Az@@ endorf the waste water fee will be increased at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a final calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf is then 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , it was noted in the approval of the budget by the Rural District Office of Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that for these wastewater facilities under@@ cover .
due to legal foundations , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the facilities cost @-@ effectively .
as of October 1 , 2016 , citizens as well as commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ h@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to go deeper into the pur@@ ses .
fee increases lie between 48 and 67 percent .
as Managing Director Herbert Schmidt showed to the Board , a new calculation of the fees for the waste water systems of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ cover from the previous calculation period will also be equ@@ ated .
the major increases in charge rises Schmidt that there are relatively small facilities with a very low san@@ itation rate between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
for example , due to the small distribution basis , expenses for necessary repairs would have a grave effect of several thousand euros .
in addition , the wastewater volume in all three plants is slightly decreasing .
furthermore , in the past period of calculation , all three plants were not least attracted to a considerable extent owing to their age rehabilitation and repair expendi@@ tures .
the facility in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the plants for the Wel@@ h@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p for almost 20 years .
Schmidt indicated that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to a damage in the Az@@ endorf sewage system .
in the pumping station Wel@@ h@@ ahl , the nearly 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led from the ground up and in the pond clari@@ fier Lop@@ p , the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be removed after almost 20 years , the sewage slu@@ dge was dispos@@ ed of and an additional aer@@ ation facility was installed in order to comply with the water @-@ legal requirements in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the continued care and maintenance costs , which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period , came into consideration . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were still considerably below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made it clear that at the low waste water intake in the three plants , expenses for the operation and maintenance were &quot; fully beaten . &quot;
Schmidt , the market community of major entertainment expenses in the waste water installations over the past 20 years , has been spar@@ ed .
the situation for the mentioned facilities will continue to remain prec@@ arious due to stone houses in the long run , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal sewage management association in order to not extend these facilities because they are defici@@ ent institutions .
Bulgaria leaves inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed compared with the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic drinks ( 1.7 % ) ; Transport ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0,1 % ) .
prices stayed as in the previous month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Snap@@ chat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; effect as an Asian cartoon critici@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot;
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filtering tool , it enables snap@@ chat around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders on the absurd .
you can transform yourself into an p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be made of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are un@@ blo@@ oming , self @-@ rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all false entran@@ ces reach the public .
in the past , Snap@@ chat filters have drawn criticism in which they were charged that the app would promote black@@ face or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week suggested some users a filter that gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist cartoon by Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a larger problem that the company has a diversity .
the news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat announced that it would have de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended to pay homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced rac@@ ism rec@@ alled the filter of vulnerable c@@ lich@@ és .
others opposed the Ani@@ me Com@@ par@@ ison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace wrote as@@ par@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose tweet was widely circul@@ ated across the photos that the filter was &quot; vulnerable and easy to say . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the ju@@ x@@ tap@@ osition of a very reluct@@ ant Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ faced , but that the yellow face has been moved to the end of the extreme .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses these cultural stum@@ ps .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race as their older counterpart - might be more likely to expect sensitivity .
when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates an image that is insul@@ ting to a user , &quot; it is much more difficult that such things go un@@ noticed than it used to be , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete her Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay for media and in a telephone interview , she said that they believe that race @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in setting practices for Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the mostly white , only male leadership and finished their essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either she has no different representation of people with other skin colors in their staff so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that has largely un@@ answered Snap@@ chat .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise .
on Thursday , the Snap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently set up a human resource manager focusing on sub @-@ represented populations and on internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu said that she will keep her Snap@@ chat account closed and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military Command Pro@@ mis@@ es IS@@ IS Intelligence Information , Speci@@ fies Congress Committee
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence services in order to draw up an optim@@ istic image of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as the actual conditions on @-@ site would have allowed an enquiry committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the armed forces of the armed forces , intelligence committees and the military budget compromise , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command sec@@ rec@@ y analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , shortly C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence provided by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders regularly referred to a positive picture of American efforts against terrorism as they had allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at the Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management errors in the Cent@@ Com range up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in training Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts face the pressure from their superi@@ ors to draw a more optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements in front of the Congress were considerably more positive than it corresponds to the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , it &apos;s so clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the Central Command points changed the intelligence reports to down@@ play the danger posed by IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the re@@ public@@ ans called the Task Force to life after it was played that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights as the investigation continues .
in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ Com reports are under way by the Ministry of Defense &apos;s General In@@ spec@@ tor .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday , consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced the highest level Dem@@ ok@@ rat in the Committee of Represent@@ atives , member of the representative house Adam B. Schiff , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , Mr Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accused the mor@@ als of analy@@ st and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave too little room for diver@@ gent opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of a White House intervention in the Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st with regard to a &quot; definite political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon general inspec@@ tor who was accepted after complaints from Cent@@ Com Analy@@ sts .
according to C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on any reports of the Congress , while the investigation of the General In@@ spec@@ tor was still underway .
but he also stated that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that intelligence services and the ministry of defense welcome controversial discussions on these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions for the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that has since been made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , last year &apos;s alleg@@ ations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State recall the intermediate activities of more than ten years ago , when a cent@@ com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush presented only a small crew in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in rising up against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
last year , Mr. Hoo@@ ker &apos;s team stated that according to government officials , contrary to the government &apos;s statements , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the terrorist group &apos;s financial position , as these provisional refin@@ eries were put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
this recognition , however , was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ Com &apos;s commander , GM Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature for his excessive positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin was retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel at Central Command .
the United States wins fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , show@@ down with Great Britain
one day after firing three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games were supposed to be a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember what ever did .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am not one of the people who keep their doors in memory .
but she knows this : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place , who are un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final match of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter final , the game will decide which of the two will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first placed one will follow the strong Dutch slightly longer out of the way that the other group will lead .
whatever the game is going to end on Saturday , the Americans have fired up a surprising mu@@ ddle because of their success story , four years after they landed in the last London Games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and for the first time with three years she had a ho@@ ckey club in her hands ( her two older sisters played sports at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
it missed the Olympics in 2008 because it could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team , began to turn things into a better place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical shift , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we didn &apos;t have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
we have been able to get rid of the ru@@ dder completely .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the door row in the first half of the game with a back@@ stop from the close range .
India had gone into the game without winning the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she ran a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then pulled in the middle and kno@@ cked the ball in the gate to give the American a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the US , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
in the middle of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and inevitable , a fast relay race between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning staff , which is handed down from the Cross@@ bow to the float to the tur@@ ner for tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t switch on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour &apos;s chat in the queue , without listening to Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the quar@@ rel between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympics and a s@@ warm of women with dimples , could have been among those well @-@ known names sent to Prime Time by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising , if he would be a swi@@ mmer , gymn@@ ast or even fen@@ cer .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights gold in the Olympic trampoline .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event equally .
further from the center , some in the shade are the sports which are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast @-@ swimming and may it rule for a long time .
but if I would like to make a modest argument for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , it was perceived so spar@@ sely for the last 16 years that many of those who asked me did not know that it is an Olympic sport .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to the competition , there has never been a medal in jumping on the trampoline and until 2012 had an ath@@ lete who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and Russians are inclined to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend her Gold Med@@ al from London this year .
the trampoline jumping has a certain out@@ sider charm , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ lown school than that sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a devoted enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ ous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ish trem@@ bling of its never @-@ ending boun@@ cing - but also the grace of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two sports which essentially unites them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; jumping @-@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
asp@@ iring winners jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , holding and balance ) before they land on their feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the official Olympic program , they are rated for performance , difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts need to continue in their quest for gold , faster , up and down , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes back and forth , up and down at the playground .
they not only ch@@ ase the finish line or the output wall , but also another height target in the television broadcast : that of the world or the olymp@@ ic by@@ te .
the goal @-@ oriented quest is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it &apos;s enough to even beat a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it &apos;s also what I feel tired even when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly back up .
here too there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during practice there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant suspension of time and gravity .
it &apos;s as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be .
the qualification and final hours of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming around 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final hours as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.@@ 00 .
in the midst of Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be over@@ looked in general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness can be achieved only by the ap@@ pre@@ hen@@ sion and the objective of male athletes - as the male US @-@ Tur@@ ner suggested recently according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey is expecting his new fan community .
&quot; a generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long is an ally of the USA
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters calling for political changes in Ethiopia pushed the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses testified that dozens of prot@@ esters were killed during the cl@@ ashes with the police when they were shot .
is Ethiopia just going to collapse ?
in the last ten years it was one of Africa &apos;s most stable countries , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into ever @-@ increasing areas .
last week , thousands of people hit the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response was rel@@ ent@@ less .
witnesses testified that polic@@ emen shot and killed tens of un@@ armed prot@@ esters .
in circulation , videos on the protests which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security people hit young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights authority now demands a thorough investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will even become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project manager of the Africa International Cris@@ is Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
American military and secret services work closely with Ethiop@@ ians to combat terror hazards beyond the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations continued to lead repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restra@@ ined , and dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or prison , killed or driven to the wi@@ gs of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you op@@ press people and have no other options but prot@@ esting , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
after a widely critici@@ zed election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time , tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts , such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front , or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den , have been forced more or less in recent years to use tur@@ mo@@ il and re@@ arm themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness may explo@@ de after years of getting into the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
it was only in recent years that many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media , as cheaper smartphones became more and more common and the internet services improved .
even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still can communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are .
several young Ethiop@@ ians held that they were so prot@@ esting .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ per@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ per@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons the Am@@ per@@ as prosp@@ ered , who come from Ethiopia &apos;s predominantly Christian high countries , in politics and economics , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , many of whom are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but this is also changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Chan@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the greatest protests took place in the areas of Am@@ per@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is fairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and is dominant in the military , intelligence services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , until his death on a disease that was not made public in 2012 was 17 years in Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister .
he was regarded as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think around corners .
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ content and using special officers to manipul@@ ate opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively in@@ transparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
contrary to Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of North Ethiop@@ ian , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia had witnessed such uph@@ eav@@ al was in 2005 after thousands of protests were prot@@ esting which , according to analysts , were apparently ple@@ dged by the government and subsequently stolen .
during the following ra@@ ids many prot@@ esters were killed , even though it was less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train and for their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal abuse of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous eth@@ ni@@ cal form .
last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ic city , managed by Tig@@ ray led businesses and hatred against the tig@@ ri@@ ans becomes more and more common in the social media .
analysts say that the protests are bringing the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over neighboring Somalia , even though it recently reported that it closed this base .
while West@@ ern@@ ers clearly want to support democracy , he does not want his ally collap@@ sing in an already volati@@ le area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim Obama has founded IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J.@@ Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his repeatedly repeated claim that President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton were the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously meant .
this clari@@ fication raised new questions on the communication skills of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public .
it also brings its fellow campaig@@ ners who try to protect him during an event@@ ful stage , in the peculiar position to declare statements which he could not have meant at all .
after he had made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening Mr. Tr@@ ump revers@@ ed his claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was just sar@@ c@@ astic .
the T@@ we@@ et was the opposite to the previous day Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the alleg@@ ation was completely serious .
when the conservative radio present@@ er Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tr@@ ump to weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate wanted to know nothing about it .
the last storm of criticism came down on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tried to draw the focus of his campaign for declining demand values to the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Mich@@ ig@@ an this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again .
following Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defence .
at the end of July he drew a strong criticism when he thought that the Russians were to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s e @-@ mails , but later he explained , &quot; Of course , I said the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then rowing back as needed .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his ways to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction fails . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communications expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates .
but I think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump accepted an even more et@@ cher tone , as his demand values declined further .
a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a lead with a leading edge in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying not to excuse oneself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative remarks , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humor .
but while he is increasingly focusing his attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps j@@ okes his loyal companions in the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s most prominent pron@@ oun@@ cements , had great difficulty defending the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview of Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Gi@@ uli@@ ani said he was questioned about Mr Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s statement whether Mr Obama and Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama IS an almost unknown , small organization , he called it a h@@ ind bro@@ ker , completely wrong , and that &apos;s why it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream re@@ public@@ ans attempt to argue that the government under Obama , in which Clinton served as Secretary of State , allowed IS@@ IS to expand by allowing them to aggres@@ sively control the situation in the Middle East .
before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of quar@@ rel@@ ing on each of his words and being prejudi@@ ced against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats mo@@ cked Mr Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s ap@@ ology as just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
once driven by the price from the market , café is back in Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a cute café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could pay only cash , which didn &apos;t have Wi @-@ Fi , but served good coffee for 15 years .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store were sup@@ planted .
the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie shop , which replaced Ver@@ b in summer 2014 , sells the soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people saw it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is exemp@@ ted and Ver@@ b is now a soap shop . &quot;
but if New York is a change , then it is also new invention .
a re@@ vit@@ alized verb Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old coffee bar , the owner and managing director of the new coffee bar .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a customer offered to provide money for a new exterior , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , retained many things .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment too .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ nish@@ ings like cap@@ ers and aci@@ dic onions .
there are natural swe@@ eten@@ ers .
the café serves no more beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also displaced by prizes from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , used to live in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly .
even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the road .
after the verb had closed , she gave up the coffee drinking , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was clear to me that it was at the coffee and in the culture of the verb that pleased me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even if on that day she has ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i tea instead of her usual ced coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the start of the club in 2003 .
he went there before work and in@@ vari@@ ably ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came fourth after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had no res@@ ent@@ ment in the fact that the soap business had occupied the old business room .
in fact , the owner of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered to make a special soap for bre@@ w with the cold bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we &apos;ll go down to her offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants of Green@@ points also accepted the café .
a new customer translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he intended to exhibit them soon , so that his new neighbours feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice bar would like to fill and sell the cold bre@@ wed coffee .
there is a chance that the café expands to a neighboring building .
for many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favour@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee was felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell that , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a plentiful meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his accession to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a gourmet , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined Fi@@ fth Avenue delicacies , such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land Tur@@ tle Sou@@ p .
his menu on this day was a bit more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with people suffering , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to Americans how to eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and they are both food historians .
Co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; was talking about Chinese cuisine in the USA , while bri@@ ck@@ laying in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; relates to life in a residential building on the Lower East Side of the food perspective .
her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed their culinary solidarity when they met with a repor@@ ter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop , a small , sn@@ app@@ y snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture .
when the repor@@ ter ordered roast meat , this found the couple suitable for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper , which stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinners .
Co@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ Buffet .
teams of women cook for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draws the paths with which the country was dealing with not being the land of milk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for the Americans became a central , stra@@ ined theme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e al@@ lied why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious dishes such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became a stap@@ le food , the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; Ziegel@@ man noted , as coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit .
meat , which was the focal point of American cuisine for many years , became a seldom served luxury .
unique mixtures were tried out , as a low @-@ cal@@ orie and nutri@@ tious satisfaction would take preced@@ ence over taste or even healthy kitchen sense .
during her research for the book , which includes recipes , Ziegel@@ man prepared a dish from this period , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addition at noon , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the house economics recipes .
as never before or since , household econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , Head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - drove the country &apos;s eating habits in such a manner .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ keeping politicians &quot; and the challenge of converting P@@ amp@@ e as cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a feast of historic delicacies .
especially tasty are the reports on the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , like President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ eating attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant kitchen in his kitchen , he vom@@ ited like the million@@ aire man of the world he has become .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gold @-@ plated dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was really strange to reality .
President Roos@@ ev@@ elt might have made the same mistake if his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to make an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the present of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors created by Ms Roos@@ ev@@ elt meant that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression to deal with food was dis@@ car@@ ded as soon as the country came back to the legs .
the legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food , brick man said , as well as how science was applied to food .
the couple gave in writing the book the eating habits of Ziegel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law better understood - for example , how they could not throw food away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of food waste , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she really made people ill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the blast of the wind .
after the plates at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s were cleared , they and Co@@ e produced a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert that President Roos@@ ev@@ elt did eat lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man and added that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everybody di@@ pped something reluct@@ antly into the t@@ amed , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it did not taste bad .
Co@@ E took a beat three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ bud@@ zer , he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few h@@ ack@@ ed wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything in order to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has even died in a barrel bomb attack of the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of the White Helm@@ ets , a group of civilians who , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 60@@ ,000 lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives at stake in order to pull people out of bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the Civil Guard , showing him at an 11 hour rescue of an inf@@ ant from the rub@@ ble of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians g@@ lowing symbol@@ ism in the hor@@ r@@ ors of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he never saw himself as a hero , said according to the picture : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the real ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I am dying to save lives , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters dischar@@ ged four barrels above the Alz@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now removing the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ nants of the bomb , so that children can &apos;t play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture rec@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland shar@@ k : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ hair usually come to the surface only in winter .
after an investigation this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea on board the S@@ anna research ship .
it was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats at a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland shar@@ k only get up with 150 years of offspring .
lei@@ surely the Greenland shar@@ k swi@@ ms at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it comes in average just 1.@@ 220 meters far .
only when it matters , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates to a full 2.@@ 6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
this lifestyle characterized by slow@@ ness , however , seems to be a recipe for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the scientific journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate of a Greenland shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock this life @-@ span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evolution@@ bi@@ ologist presum@@ ed for a long time that Greenland shar@@ k will become stone @-@ old .
only the evidence was lacking .
Greenland &apos;s arks are hard to observe , after all they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually only appear in the winter at the surface .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s hair .
they measured their slow motion as they fitted six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
the sh@@ arks nevertheless make this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
possibly they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice cream and seek cad@@ aver , which tor@@ ment from higher water layers down@@ wards .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland shar@@ k , which caught Fischer from Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depths of North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013 .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the largest shar@@ k was 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers .
to determine the age of the animals , they analysed with the carbon @-@ 14 method the lens nucle@@ us of the sh@@ arks .
this centre of the eye lens already arises before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained therein are not renewed later .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had stri@@ k@@ ingly high carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
its birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons search de@@ ported large quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the third @-@ smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ ers length , the l@@ enti@@ cular nucle@@ us , on the other hand , contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear weapons , so its 50@@ th birthday is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
in their lens nucle@@ us all larger Greenland shar@@ k , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities produced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 @-@ cen@@ timeter @-@ long Greenland shar@@ k showed an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ res might even be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland shar@@ k females only get young when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers of the length could classi@@ fy an old age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res was probably at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age with 156 years was determined , Greenland shar@@ k with the increase obviously can be at least one and a half centuries of time .
this is also likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates currently .
it is no coincidence that such methane minerals live mainly in icy waters .
the previous record holder , a 211 year old Greenland whale , in whose bac@@ on at the neck was a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon tip , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on fire @-@ flame .
so they later ri@@ pen - and age slowly .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often very big .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal em@@ its warmth .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than one gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as early as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the Evol@@ ution@@ bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very big animal , on the other hand , should invest his resources more in a long life .
building site in double pack
in the recent meeting , the municipal council has focused heavily on topics related to construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the body accepted the announcement of mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of recently reported residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the land , par@@ cel@@ ing and closing questions were clari@@ fied and the applications could be put on survey , the sale of the plots in the residential areas &quot; Road Route &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area of Bin@@ der@@ straße - section 1 ) is no longer available to interested parties .
the municipal council is convinced that the rural areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schön@@ au will appeal to young families and the elderly alike .
as it was said , civil volunteers can now report in the town hall , and the municipal council is expected to give advice on the allocation of the par@@ c@@ els in its September session .
in order to accommodate requests for the reloc@@ ation of other commercial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the land use plan newly created in the spring of this year in sub @-@ areas .
in the area of Unter@@ time@@ lar@@ n , the industrial area , which is already shown there , is extended by two plots towards the state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
according to this , the City of Main has the best chances to attract new jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the I@@ W &apos;s financial markets and real estate markets .
after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether banks will continue to operate from London through financial transactions across the EU .
for the so @-@ called EU passport , they have been approved in the UK until now .
these are currently being used by major US banks .
several banks have already announced plans to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lob@@ b@@ ying association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ates 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which is responsible for monetary policy and over@@ sight of the largest banks in the euro zone , and other important authorities such as the European insurance policy E@@ IO@@ PA and the ES@@ R@@ B insurance policy .
while the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) is headquartered in Paris , this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder .
while Luxembourg has a large fund industry , it does not cut off the infrastructure as well as Dublin .
thanks to the airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach .
the city also points out with readily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris , it &apos;s not so easy to find free @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial real estate are by 50 percent higher than on the River Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition due to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the corporate consultancy Mer@@ cer the city was ranked 7th , Luxemburg in No. 19 , Dublin at No. 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preference : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its strong position as a financial location for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , my economic researchers .
in London , according to figures of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 some 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead gets legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
an American magi@@ strate decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal expenses arising from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was freed from $ 200 million in compensation for the infrin@@ gement of two Mer@@ ck patents , which were in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge revealed a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of mer@@ cs , including per@@ jury and other un@@ ethical practices .
when the complaint was filed on Thursday , U.S. counterpart Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to the expense incurred during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck is attempting to compare Gilead to a new generation of hepatitis C medication that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck merged each other and took ownership of laboratory work , which provided sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir bas@@ el@@ ag , the active ingredient in the medication of Gilead .
forces supported by the USA say they have reg@@ ained full control of Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
troops backed by the United States have reg@@ ained full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters left in the city , a group spokes@@ man said on Friday .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) stem from the removal of the remaining group of fighters that have mo@@ cked within the city , currently the city .
they delivered over 2,000 civilians , who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , sharing with the D@@ KS of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council , Reu@@ ters , al@@ lied with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are leading up sp@@ aci@@ ousness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday their tax return for 2015 , which gave the Democrats and their hus@@ bands an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.3 million in speech records ; the former Secretary of State gave an income of USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book about her term in the State Department .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for vice @-@ president , Sen@@ ator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton , published his tax declarations for the last ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ trac@@ ers in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax returns .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations , even though they are not obliged to do so by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by tax authorities as a reason for his refusal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the move , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign hel@@ per Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , in terms of the publication of the democr@@ ats &quot; presidential candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps special advis@@ er , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish anything before the tax tests were not completed .
Tr@@ um@@ ps critics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , his donations for char@@ itable organizations , his business interests and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton had already top@@ pled on the subject and released a video on the internet on Friday in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump invited Tr@@ ump to publish his tax return .
on Thursday she addressed the issue during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ ig@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax returns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Politi@@ co reported that Tr@@ ump paid no or only very little tax in the 1990s , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a series of tax advis@@ ors and tax consultants on Friday that would still be the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , which would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during a campaign for H@@ illary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for a buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has his seat here , Tr@@ ump to a meeting to exchange their tax returns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he had also undergone a tax audit of the I@@ RS and Tr@@ ump was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; afraid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax return as far back as 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , which are now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , have aver@@ aged an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 40@@ ,5 % .
the tax return of the 2015 Clin@@ tons showed that they only purchased $ 100 of their income as wages , unlike most Americans .
their main investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and income from USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed .

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ zer , fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ anian elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going to settlements inhabited by people - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with ch@@ ili@@ ft .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , who already had the idea for years , has intensified its promotion along with the U.S. nature conservation , by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and harvest without hur@@ ting animals .
previously , many sp@@ ears used to defend themselves .
Friday is the day of the space dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities , and they are much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; said the Managing Director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps comprise the lighting of the elephant with a torch and the bubbles in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ch@@ illi @-@ cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ch@@ ili@@ zer mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body in a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition cord .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom burst with a b@@ ang and spray fine dust to the air .
a breath is usually sufficient to ch@@ ase the elephant .
one last possibility is a laun@@ cher shooting a piece of gold in the air and causing a loud , bright explosion .
City Council resol@@ ves unanim@@ ously : no new building on the Rhine at St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer
normally , the St. Go@@ ar@@ er &apos;s investment projects take place from business@@ men with K@@ us@@ sh@@ and - the retail sector in the core city is considered to be clearly exp@@ and@@ able .
the application for the new construction of a sales floor on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhein@@ au@@ tor , which is currently under construction , is now unanim@@ ously rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fundamentally , we welcome new tra@@ des@@ men , but at this location in exposed position on the banks of the banks of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk no longer suits , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jewish director crush@@ es Berlin Hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demand - RT News &quot; &quot; &quot;
a French director with Jewish roots le@@ ashed a media rebellion after he revealed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list any Israeli pre @-@ election since there were &quot; requests for Arab guests &quot; according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust Docum@@ entation &quot; Sho@@ a , &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the hotel &apos;s country code list .
the country , however , was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in the year 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and er@@ ased ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center .
looking for an explanation , the director appe@@ aled to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shot him &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as lance wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel employee said the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of management at the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it triggered a more fur@@ y in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election be cleared , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Lanz@@ mann employee cited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great dis@@ grace &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and upset by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident triggered a fairly large resonance on the Internet where people called the whole a sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some subordin@@ ate to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had &quot; given up &quot; the alleged demands of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said in another article that was pointed out that the hotel , which is located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ sten@@ damm , is close to a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; watch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Lanz@@ mann , Der Spiegel reported . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct statement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to add Israel into the quick @-@ election list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code has been added .
police put Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; rubber stories against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
on Thursday , students joined the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reform for the public education system .
police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , causing the police to deposit rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about the plans .
according to the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State of São Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are implemented to save money .
some of the protests were gra@@ ff@@ led by gra@@ ff@@ iti against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
the recent protests took place several days after demonstr@@ ators went into the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dismissed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran continues to rise to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and Te@@ hr@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the year @-@ on @-@ year comparison .
since the international sanctions were lifted against Iran , interest on the side of Russian companies was growing strongly in the country , the ambassador addressed .
Russian companies are taking up existing links with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further commercial expansion is one of the main priorities for bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that in the first five months of 2016 trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports in Iran j@@ umped by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran increased 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade boom was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia this year .
last year , the Russian foreign agency issued some 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries concerned with the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year are broken , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only a few Russians are visiting Iran , something that the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who have preserved the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good state , &quot; he said .
witnesses wanted : beverage market covered in forest fires
on Thursday evening a rob@@ ber@@ y raid on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL was carried out at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the support of a fire@@ arm , three dark @-@ dressed people , who had m@@ um@@ med their faces , demanded the release of cash from the staff of the beverage market and then fled first on foot and then presumably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf .
the police do not share how much money has been exploited .
the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 metres , so relatively small .
the beverages market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market and is poorly visible .
the perpetr@@ ators must , after the assault , run towards Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and be escaped from the parking lot located opposite the parking @-@ house entrance with the silver @-@ colored car , possibly in the direction B 256 ( Schla@@ derer ring ) .
those who have made observations at the time of the crime ( at 7 : 45 p.m. ) , who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y , should report urgently to the police .
Nag@@ old : fun and fun during the summer break
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and you@@ ths of the social educational daily group / social group work of the children &apos;s protection federation Nag@@ old with their assistants on their summer break in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
in the lei@@ surely leisure centre of Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle the life @-@ joyful group was lod@@ ged during the first school holiday week .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand , it went to B@@ loo@@ ster with the visit of the stro@@ king zoo .
on the other hand to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special child &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery .
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Celtic museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about the daily life and food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days , the group enjoyed the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , who invited for jumping , swimming and sp@@ lashing .
culinary delights were given to children and car@@ ers with their own homemade food , such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ itt@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ breakfast and b@@ ang@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese .
in workshops was b@@ ati@@ fied , beautiful pieces of jewelry made of beads and stones or made of wood a Roman mill game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , evenings at the fire and the final &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Color@@ ful E@@ ven@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the day of the journey home , the sun and the children and young people returned home satisfied .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgri@@ m to the Do@@ or of Charity
the ministers from the pastoral care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four @-@ day pilgrimage to Freiburg .
together , four stages were overcome .
in order to bridge the period up to the next Rom@@ ance pilgrimage of all the young regi@@ stran@@ ts in two years , the St. Anna senior minist@@ erial round decided to prepare and carry out a long @-@ day pilgrimage .
various pilgrimage destinations have been examined and finally decided for the Ep@@ is@@ cop@@ al City of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy on the Freiburg cathedral .
16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Hei@@ ligen@@ zimmern opened their way .
in the evening , Par@@ ish Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ gri@@ m Cross and distributed the Pil@@ gri@@ mage .
from Hor@@ b , by train , we went to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Min@@ ster of Our Lady stood and so the pilgri@@ m way from the Münster was started .
the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening , depending on a brief impulse with various prayers , songs and texts .
but also on the way , Min@@ is repeat@@ ed@@ ely made R@@ ast to sing together a song from specially made pilgrims song book .
par@@ ishes of the local parish were available for overnight stays .
at the stage destinations Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller took care of a tasty and star@@ chy evening meal and breakfast .
on the second day we went on Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach on the second day .
the next day , the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , had to be climbed to about 500 metres in altitude and then climbed .
the deserved reward was a shared barbecue at the Bad@@ wei@@ her in the evening .
after the morning pulse on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , we went to the final stage to Freiburg .
visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy the Min@@ is met on the Freiburg Min@@ ster in the later afternoon and walked through the gates of mercy .
with a small impulse , God was thank@@ ed here .
in the evening mass in Münster the Min@@ is of Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t , who arrived at the pilgri@@ m &apos;s destination , were welcomed .
after the divine service , pilgrims were able to visit the sacri@@ stry and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the B@@ reis@@ gau metropolis .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
at the end all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked .
Scot@@ s@@ man Call@@ um Sk@@ inner rush@@ es home when Br@@ ite wins gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last night in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int in Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame , when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glas@@ gow assumed the role played by his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y . he was proud of the legend when he stor@@ med home to hit New Zealand &apos;s favour@@ ites .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago while Ho@@ y scored the fifth of six Olympic gold med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after taking only a modest sixth place in London at the World Championships in London in spite of the squ@@ at &apos;s back .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did so in good time as a hin@@ dran@@ ce .
Ho@@ y &apos;s retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that had un@@ folded .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y prevailed - and Sk@@ inner placed an olymp@@ ic ch@@ ord in the qualification laps , but in the standard round the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ des fell short after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner kept it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation , in which Hin@@ des went in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as BBC expert and dropped Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they rose to the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glas@@ gow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for myself .
we set up an olymp@@ ic record in the final round and defeated the world champi@@ ons .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 on the Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys side , Hin@@ du admitted that after a weak start , he deliberately went to the track .
he with@@ drew this statement later and there was no objection to British ri@@ vals .
with such a victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ di said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole GB of flags on the tri@@ b@@ une like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team over the last three months .
we &apos;ve come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days in the bicycle rom .
with the Form Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of possibility that he repeatedly repe@@ ats Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
that would mean for Kenn@@ y - who is exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who also was born on March 23 ( a seemingly sacred date for British sport ; on that day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were also born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
this would be the same from Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y is next in the Sprint , which starts today and will go for more than three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ di said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he wins two other gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometer race .
they came to the finish in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record that won gold in London 2012 was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
yesterday , he fought with delegates before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his height .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition which will be continued and terminated in the morning , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ el S@@ hand@@ ong , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ ga@@ vie on a world record period in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the UK team relies on his strong team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a crowd of med@@ als .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were down@@ gra@@ ded .
Dra@@ mas played in the background , so the res@@ ignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April amid sex@@ ism and mo@@ b@@ bing repro@@ aches as well as retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks as if the now legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , could be repeated again .
future of sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land by lifting the energy yield question@@ able
the future of the aluminium sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces of workers - are at stake , as plant operators are announ@@ cing the energy supply contract and thereby raising all delivery contracts , such as the supplying energy company announced .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria earlier this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a maxim@@ inum payout for 20 years runs in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the installation of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
no less than 2000 work@@ stations - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk of closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects as the melt consum@@ es approximately 10 percent of the total power generation of Victoria .
in 2014 Al@@ coa finished the Point Henry enam@@ el , which resulted in closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station last year .
the melt of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses cash and ris@@ king a closure .
this step follows years of speculation as to the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and recently due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners will termin@@ ate their contracts .
the plant is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p keep smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L expects the plant to continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means another physical demand for electricity through the melt , &quot; announced the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continues to say that the contracts are so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that should have entered into force in November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a period of 12 months , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from this point , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the current supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on income to AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the pre@@ dictions of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L announced that it had already deduc@@ ted the value of the contracts in its annual depreci@@ ation of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of a termination . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ co@@ as ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did not interfere . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang in 2010 , who would have entered into force from November this year , even if it is still a matter of explanation why it has withdrawn from the contract .
analysts warn of the sector &apos;s poor economic situation before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melting plant in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
in reference to the analysts &apos; statements at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts per year to generate about 900 MW of electricity per year .
should both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the electricity market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and it wouldn &apos;t be good for us as a generating set , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner clan . Kris is on the cover of the sought @-@ after September edition of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to cry , &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote .
the cover of the cover was followed by a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans ) , accompanied reality video that shows the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner family ( with the exception of the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) as well as in the presence of the universally popular Show@@ bi@@ z un@@ cle and producers of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) .
this represents the c@@ lich@@ é of almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity .
with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has certainly begun .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes her as regards the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were looking to see them in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September edition is the most sold out of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference that rather resembles an illustrated book than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of advertis@@ ers ( Ac@@ cor@@ ding fashion@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the tome 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover star is expected to be so long@@ ingly expected that in the last two years pictures of the magazine filtered through before the official announcement .
women who have already been on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models , the celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar prize @-@ winner and Di@@ or @-@ brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the previous category , she is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to celeb@@ ri@@ ties or reality stars or you@@ ths of today who know how to make a good Snap@@ chat video ( even though everything is true for Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who are involved in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course J@@ enny &apos;s success doesn &apos;t suit everyone .
with her reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the world of fashion was always somewhat ten@@ se .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed them and called them &quot; the mi@@ st@@ let@@ oe of the moment . &quot;
these feelings looked up again when the message appeared with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but running around on the mess seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
she makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters are selling pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her own pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds &apos;s daughter to the LOVE magazine .
and in her spare time she is seen in reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
every year , municipal law centers have 160@@ ,000 people every year
more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s auxili@@ aries are re@@ buff@@ ed annually by the municipal coun@@ cils , while the industry is making reference to the effects of further central cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land there are already three out of five persons - mostly older persons , immigrants , needy people , victims of violence and those who have no means of un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ ations and similar - in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already busy at full capacity , are ready for further reductions .
as of June next year , it is fores@@ een that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funding .
the director of the Que@@ ens@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l Community Centre said that the last survey of the National Council of Community Centr@@ es has shown that thousands of people are already rejected every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that without an ann@@ ul@@ ment of the resolution of the Federal Government , the situation would only be worse .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s com@@ mon@@ wealth centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means that thousands of people are rejected by important services you need , &quot; he said .
people who leave violent relationships , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and oppres@@ sive debts , families that have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been un@@ just@@ ly dismissed - all these people have problems in the right way and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need .
the German government will cut the funding by 30 percent from June 2017 , meaning that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call on the Federal At@@ tor@@ ney General and Federal Minister of Justice as well as Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these funds so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for guidance on the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their communities , and that the Government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump Ele@@ ction Camp@@ aig@@ n accused of recru@@ iting staff
new York : Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps Camp@@ aig@@ n was charged with alleged in@@ activity after she was informed that her campaign leader for North Carolina turned a gun into a member of staff while she was travelling in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday at the Charlotte District Court by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ord@@ i admitted to have been waiting for months that the matter would be internally controlled before he realized that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dra@@ gged a gun , put his right foref@@ inger on the trigger , and took the course in Vinc@@ ente &apos;s knee , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he gave in his indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after compla@@ ining about the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ord@@ i noted that at least four other persons had had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he wrote in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to harm damage , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indi@@ ct@@ ment arrived only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate launched a tur@@ mo@@ il when he said a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arm owners and tru@@ sts - should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton was elected and judge .
Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign made it clear that the media had torn his words out of context and that he would not inc@@ ite violence .
B@@ ordin@@ i &apos;s complaint requires damages from the campaign for violation of duty to care and by Philip due to physical injury and permanent mental damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps press secretary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hope Hi@@ cks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was not reachable for a comment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
attempts to contact Philip likewise failed .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer a member of the campaign .
on calls from his consulting firm , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , was not re@@ acted .
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , Donald Tr@@ ump , has so far conducted a controversial campaign .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : poll@@ s before countries elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) have significant losses for the SPD and CD@@ U government parties .
this resulted in representative surveys conducted by the IN@@ SA public opinion research institute for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition in the north could scar@@ cely manage to go@@ vern , this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin .
but in both provinces the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances of continuing to be the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , the SPD dropped from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party only sm@@ iled shortly before the CD@@ U , which could rise to 23 per cent again .
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would be 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 per cent ) , and the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the Land@@ tag .
in spite of slight losses , the Gre@@ ens hes@@ itated in the Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag despite slight losses of 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented by 3 per cent in the Land@@ tag .
according to the survey , the SPD in Berlin only poll@@ ed 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they are thus still lying behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
at 14 percent , the Af@@ D would be represented in the Chamber of Represent@@ atives for the first time .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , whereas the pirates would not miss the move in 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator arrived on the market .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - his producer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thicker and bigger , therefore it was not good in the hand either .
on the contrary , it was rather cl@@ ums@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory was initially eight Meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would be enough today for approximately two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to the stores exactly 20 years ago on August 15 , 1996 - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few Euro fans can still buy the equipment on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age .
twenty years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; office in the west pocket format &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot for then standards : SMS and emails could be sent and received , even per fax was the communic@@ ator .
even the access to websites was possible via HTML browser , even though tor@@ menting slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
the price was quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 Euro in 2015 .
no one could suspect in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
everything has changed since then .
smart phones are a success story even if not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s mobile division experienced an unprecedented disaster , eventually sold to Microsoft and handled .
today , suppliers dominate the market , all of which came much later than Nokia .
always and everywhere online , that is for a great many people everyday life .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
about 1.4 billion devices have been sold , Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units .
worldwide sales of the devices are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running businesses of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies .
in the meantime , a whole industry has emerged around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs on Mac @-@ World announced the introduction of the iPhone .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator , all by touch screen easy to use .
the triumph@@ al march of Apple began , still today , the iPhone is the Group &apos;s most important product .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had a look at it .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after his invention .
today every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must all learn to get the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of the Siemens executive board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent accessibility is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must steer the Olympic spirit and bro@@ aden He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring regeneration and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me , that was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , as in 2012 in London when we ran a great effort to make sure that all of our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great advantages to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities , we will alone employ 10,000 new teachers , 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will da@@ zzle on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question asked .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in social growth and to leave a legacy of skills and jobs both to the airport and to the entire UK .
we have a great team at He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - the five year in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , to the T2 , which was built in the middle of the two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third run@@ way , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and bro@@ aden He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

on Tuesday , Facebook shared that its desktop page would change coding for its advertisements to make it more difficult to detect sign@@ posts showing how advertising is part of the advertising page .
but Ad@@ block announced that it had found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this sort of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ forth struggle between the ad @-@ blocking open source community and the b@@ yp@@ assing has already been underway since the invention of indicators , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has embark@@ ed on the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicators for the industry have become alar@@ ming .
according to a study published last year by Pa@@ gef@@ on@@ and Adobe , around 200 million people worldwide use display lo@@ aders ; almost four times as much 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily users who access Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of the advertising revenues of Facebook .
the company is target@@ ing ad block@@ ers on desktop PCs because mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , distributed a speaker .
advertising on desktop PCs has a sufficiently large proportion of revenues , so Facebook appears to be worth the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would update its &quot; Ad Pre@@ ference tool &quot; to give people more control over their targeted advertising .
on Thursday , Facebook maintained that Ad@@ block would be wor@@ rying about new filters because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we are planning to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook speaker in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt tool , so we have instead focused on developer tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of people .
woman with presum@@ ed suicide attempt on Swiss auto@@ bahn
the victim was lying in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call witnesses after a woman was transferred to a motorway in the early morning hours on Thursday at a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman lay in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of despair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss woman , at the age of 49 , who was over@@ driven by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , said the police who requested this as well as any witnesses of the incident to report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , distributed Gil@@ les Hof@@ st@@ etter to Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a cl@@ ash avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases over the past five years show that drivers are not held ac@@ coun@@ table .
in each of the two cases - with which a person ran in the dark on the motorway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian is running in the middle of the night on the highway as it was called in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent killing after crossing and killing a man who was lying near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 one night on the A1 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old sacrifice had drunk and had become unconscious on the street .
the Court noted that the polic@@ ew@@ oman , responding to an emergency call -- was in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; totally extraordinary and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges , should report to the police at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus once lived hab@@ itable
the Venus was probably inhab@@ itable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies by NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus by using tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine if Venus could have re@@ buff@@ ed Earth @-@ like conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably referred to more dry areas than Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from rapid evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow turn of Venus will expose its daylight side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus , similar to evolution , which was previously suspected of planet explor@@ ers .
although it was probably hab@@ itable , Venus -- over several billion years --@@ was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
their oceans were evapor@@ ated and their steam was blown away by ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen escaped , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide returned with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that as we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus &apos; climate model &apos; in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy joins the A@@ val@@ an@@ che trainer
Patrick Roy res@@ ig@@ ned on Thursday as Trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to a small co @-@ determination right in the team &apos;s decision @-@ making process .
alternatively President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new trainer .
&quot; over the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement .
in the course of the summer , I thought a lot about how I could improve this team in order to give it more depth , it needs it and bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the vision of the coach and vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must also have a right to co @-@ determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are not met at the moment .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organization and we wish him the best for the future .
during his debut season Roy has been awarded the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Award as the best trainer in the league .
he led the club on 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed in each of the two last years the post@@ season .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the game for a second wild@@ card spot at the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy has won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Canada and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers resume negotiations , strike out strikes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour disputes concerning the remuneration for North @-@ Sea workers will be suspended , while all the parties in the dispute put themselves at the table for a new round of talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil @-@ field service provider Wood Group have been spor@@ adi@@ cally carried out on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group and the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the development process of the current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will hold some full @-@ day sessions in the coming weeks starting next year to restart the problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates to its Con@@ tractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressures .
the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 percent decline in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts provide the company with the required space to come through the market down@@ turn .
shell has released for its part thousands of people and plans to give up its oil and gas business operations in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega merger with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure due to the lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that was strengthened by the British decision in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the greatest work disputes fought in the North Sea since a generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and across the country we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 fewer than $ 1.4 billion are expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars in the star cluster rotate at different rates as well as in what context the rotation periods are related to the formation of planets .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other con@@ stell@@ ations , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light@@ years distant from the earth .
many stars in this con@@ stellation , which originated some 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
they are now turning the quick@@ est .
at peak rot@@ ational rates , these mature stars rep@@ el large amounts of con@@ stell@@ ations .
as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star is ageing its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star patch -- such as sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rebel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compar@@ es stars with dancers , with larger stars turning slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
since the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is still much ahead of us what we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars will slow down their rates of rotation and , so to speak , hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
in three newspaper articles , Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball @-@ star tread
the tears ran quicker with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball @-@ star in the best days of base to base .
after his emotional withdrawal , the 41 year old pro will wear the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on 12 August against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Goo@@ db@@ ye &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; declared the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participant in the major league bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected the most valuable player in the League , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract has been giving him $ 27 million a year since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on December 31 , 2017 , he will in future act as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ ys , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es made some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two other bas@@ eball players present similar values in the main statistics .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is not likely to be included in the Hall of Gl@@ ory in the Bas@@ eb@@ alls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was on the field , so controversial is his appearance outside of the place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agreed to have banned ster@@ oids between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , it was closed for 211 games due to involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal by the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the main suspect for years to have an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a law@@ suit the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said at the time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even his farewell @-@ days don &apos;t run no@@ is@@ eless .
while many bas@@ eball legends in their last games get the big stage , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and said to the conditions with pop star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , received sympathy @-@ expressions from the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Arch@@ riv@@ al Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sang the followers at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first dop@@ ing cases
caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio will not start .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
a liter@@ al bul@@ letin would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese swi@@ mmer Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter @-@ obstacle runner in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish Wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the start of the already critically insp@@ ected athle@@ tics competitions these messages come to infin@@ ity .
last Sunday , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de was proven in Ch@@ en , which is used as a mas@@ ked means for dop@@ ing substances .
on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed its expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old clin@@ ched the fourth place in the final about 100 m of the butterfly , but only 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have participated in the events of more than 50 m of Fre@@ estyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) applied for the opening of the B @-@ rehear@@ sal and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very seriously and demands from Ch@@ en full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will work together with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases .
also during the night of Rio , the news came through the positive test at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on to the offensive himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the athle@@ tic woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is intended to act on the banned substance around the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova has been suspended for the time being , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ rehear@@ sal should also have been positive .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately contacted the ath@@ lete with criticism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for instance , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation are not allowed to participate in Rio .
on Friday the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days previously positive for the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon .
both deny the intake , however , both may not start in the class until 94 kg .
before the athletes start , especially the case of Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another serious blow for the reputation of the whole sport .
the world association IA@@ AF had forbidden the complete Russian team up to an exception owing to systematic dop@@ ing , and also the nation of Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in addition , the previous off@@ ences in China were also provided for violent confron@@ tations between athletes .
so the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium over 200 m of fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also the focus of a confrontation with Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing che@@ aters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2014 , Sun had been positively tested for the Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ dine stimul@@ ant at the Chinese Championships , but had only a three @-@ month lock .
data lau : so per@@ fi@@ de black@@ er h@@ ack@@ ers their ran@@ som
program@@ mers of black@@ mail malware are currently targeted at targeted companies - and are successful .
according to a recent survey by the malware @-@ defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes at 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surv@@ eyed companies in the past twelve months became at least once , sometimes multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of the companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims readily paid the dele@@ tion fee required by the perpetr@@ ators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again .
according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , the perpetr@@ ators are notic@@ e@@ ably speci@@ alizing in attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potential to ran@@ som er@@ ran@@ som is significantly higher than in private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a start@@ ling fast evolution of the malware , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 , most Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
first of all , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks happened quickly over the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once on a victim &apos;s computer , it searches for recently changed files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as for archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the recei@@ v@@ ables of the black@@ mail .
in order to get the final key code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin .
but where the personal photo database is at stake in private users , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production stops .
accordingly , the damage precip@@ it@@ ates when a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes .
22 percent of affected German companies reported sales losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent had to completely inter@@ rupt the business operation , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany there were already several hospitals victims of attacks whose patients could be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not pay , you only support the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay will get their data back .
for managers it is difficult to reject the perpetr@@ ators &quot; demand in view of stand@@ still in operation .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know that and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the safety researchers at F @-@ Secure have examined the user interfaces and contact with black@@ mail@@ ers and come to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain their victims via chat , how they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t sample files for free .
and if private people are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies must partly bar@@ gain collectively and pay five @-@ figure sums to get their data back un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively high @-@ risk gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ack@@ ers become more and more professional and share the work , &quot; explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the antivirus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
it is more likely that these are three or four persons .
the program@@ mers sell their malicious software then in the form of a software kit to the actual black@@ mail .
the malware @-@ Kits originated by purchasing the malware , consulting and additional tools for a one @-@ time fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the scope of delivery includes a fitting tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the black@@ ma@@ iler then searches for more h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service economy .
so you logs in one of the forums underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
the payment is eff@@ ected per infected computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually criminals employ sp@@ amm@@ ers with dis@@ semination &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the meantime , the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware has become known to many companies that better secure their data .
over 50 percent of the companies IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey rely on re@@ warding ran@@ som@@ ware by file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data encryption alone is not a threat to successful black@@ out , the perpetr@@ ators are threatening to release sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the type of data , the damage potential is much higher than before .
in the future , the perpetr@@ ators could also take completely new goals on the internet of things on the grain .
at the h@@ acker conference , Def@@ con , safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the internet under their control .
in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heater might well be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpetr@@ ators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a subject in Industry 4.0 .

Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
Honda wants to pack everything into the small HR @-@ V : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe and even the versatility of a mini@@ van .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear , it does not work tight at all .
the interior materials are well @-@ finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit upper side is slightly falling apart .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles with the storage box .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 L with raised back@@ rests and 10@@ 26 l , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seats of the back bench can be folded up like a movie seat and offer storage space , which is 1.@@ 24 metres high from the floor to the ceiling .
the luggage compartment can be loaded well , but the load height is 650 mm higher than with the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
however , he should do his job a bit qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another power@@ train : a 1.5 liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering should be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment in the tested top version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the security systems include the City emergency brake assist ( operates at speeds 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because he ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when maneu@@ vering . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed controller responds to the recognition of traffic signs and throt@@ tles the speed as required .
however , full connectivity is only available for top @-@ level equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation system , app integration and more .
two US@@ B@@ - and one HDMI jack are located under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to achieve .
the roughly 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who do not want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel of 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
Air@@ line is not liable : fall on passenger bridge
an airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
for a liability is possible only in case of danger , which are typical of air traffic , the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Berlin argued ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee in the fall .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a common risk of life , so the court .
the airline did not have to pay compensation for the man .
illness : when does the organizer pay
after their journey , ill holi@@ day@@ makers only get money back when the cause of the disease can be found in the hotel without any doubt .
this is only the case if more than ten percent of guests have proven to be able to show the same symptoms .
in the case of a negotiated case , a family was suffering from diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their stay .
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
their illness brought the vac@@ ation@@ ers back to a defective wastewater treatment plant that pur@@ ported to contam@@ inate the sea@@ water .
the family thought that the trip had been poor - and compla@@ ined against the organis@@ er .
the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs did not succeed in court .
indeed , the sewage treatment plant was in fact broken .
but the organis@@ er only heard about it shortly before departure of the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to assume that sea@@ water was fine .
he did not violate his duty of information , so did the judgment .
especially since there were no im@@ puri@@ ties found in the samples of the water .
the illness of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion with one another - is a common risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said that after the violent acts committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks .
the state must be pru@@ dent and resol@@ ute at the same time react to terrorist dangers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and division . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not treat this triumph to the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if perpetr@@ ators should leave the country more quickly , however , this hei@@ gh@@ tens the security and strengthens the consent of the population for refugee policy .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to implement the proposals up to the Bundestag election in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced further personnel rein@@ for@@ cements of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle four @-@ digit order over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympathy for terrorism should again be under punishment .
video surveillance should be improved , the tru@@ ce has been am@@ ended to make it more difficult for the purchase of weapons on the internet .
the most recently deb@@ ated sec@@ rec@@ y obligation for physicians should remain in accordance with de Ma@@ izi@@ ères &apos;s words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in dialogue with the doctors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doctors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wants to find solutions to reduce the danger of citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , with regard to psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act the ra@@ dic@@ alization of refugees , the minister considers a better social support necessary .
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ sed people .
to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , De Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the deployment of cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the interior minister clearly obj@@ ected to action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a sla@@ p for the Schar@@ f@@ ishers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gabriel , the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a bur@@ q@@ a ban and the abolition of the dual nationality .
it considers a general prohibition of full @-@ wear to be constitu@@ tionally problemati@@ cal .
you can &apos;t ban everything you refuse and I dis@@ like wearing the bur@@ q@@ a .
it is possible to talk about rules for example in traffic or for witnesses in court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; green editor Sim@@ one Peter accused the minister of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trying to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; simulate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terrorism packages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fleet of pro@@ verb@@ s and a tightening of the right of residence bring people in this country no more security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway
it is regularly st@@ owed on the b@@ ypass road - here is an image of November .
but this should change : the right balance should be extended .
this is a good news for all car drivers who are in traffic on the ambient road every night in the traffic jam , when they travel via the motorway in Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16th / 17th of August ) , road construction will be extended to the right side of the road by 700 meters between Hammer Street and Wes@@ eler Stra@@ it .
drivers can then ride directly from the Hammer Road to the right .
the major advantage : traffic spl@@ its early in , whereby the overall process is improved on the busy section of the federal highway 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder nerves the drivers especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the back@@ stage reaches the bridge across the Alber@@ slo@@ her path and sometimes beyond .
reason is the needle eye on the B 51 just before the departure Wes@@ eler Stra@@ it .
from here , the traffic is only ste@@ ered single @-@ lane over the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built back a good three @-@ quarters of years ago .
the reason : static calculations have shown that the bridge no longer has the load @-@ bearing capacity to take on the heavy @-@ duty traffic two @-@ lane .
the competent national company cannot say how long this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the connected factory traffic will continue .
but it has to be reck@@ oned with years : the bridge has an official remaining period of rest until the year 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the judi@@ ci@@ ary , the state company deliberately chose the more traffic @-@ less time during the school holidays because it had to be expected with disabilities .
traffic will be continued on the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural Travel : offers for Schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theater piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are now planning a music project .
N@@ ima &apos;s society enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Young Theater Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; 19 students between eleven and 15 years visited the production in the Small House . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims at the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster in the context of this project .
most young people in the class came to Mu@@ enster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and spoke little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action nevertheless , according to the press release of the Young Theater Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg of Spra@@ chen@@ kel , and the Young Theater will work together as part of a music theatre project in the coming season . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background will be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theat@@ rical language education are in the planning phase .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
in view of the increased number of refugees , the association reck@@ ons with many classes who want to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of the weather
the weather has made the Stern@@ schn@@ u@@ ppen @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the south @-@ west of Germany on the night to Friday a stroke through the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was badly suited for clouds and rain to watch the spectacle , the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , said on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we will see many shooting stars in the sky .
the shooting stars are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which are among the fastest shooting stars with 2@@ 16@@ ,000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us that rises in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
in the evening you roll around etern@@ ally , at night you lie awake for hours , in the morning it is not possible to think of sleep long before the alarm clock .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequent or permanent as not relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleep problems manifest themselves ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many causes behind them , emphasizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ ak , member of the board of the German Society of S@@ leep Medicine and S@@ leep Medicine .
what one understands for the time being , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , i.e. an entry and sleeping disorder .
it is precisely the sleeping experience that many people perceive as uns@@ atis@@ factory or insufficient , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board of the German household medical association with practice in Var@@ el in Lower Saxony .
what &apos;s behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind this can be organic , mental or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also drugs .
sleep distur@@ b@@ ance is often an expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is common in depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ ak . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors are mutually dependent .
for example , those who have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc can sleep badly , wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to sal@@ ute over everyday problems and worries , there are kind of things .
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are affected by the day should go to the doctor , advises broke away .
the impairment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache .
to allevi@@ ate sleep problems , it is important to find out their causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or drugs - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases , and no more than two weeks at most .
Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medicine centre of the Char@@ ité Universitäts@@ medizin Berlin , is hardly available in Germany .
therefore , one should first contact the family doctor in case of sleep problems , advises broke away .
this can clarify with studies whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go into the fl@@ ab@@ or , and what happens there ?
for example , in the case of snor@@ ing with air@@ ful@@ s , for example in case of poor day@@ time , sleep@@ wal@@ kers or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping distur@@ b@@ ance , Fi@@ etze ad@@ mits to the examination of the sleep laboratory .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please do not make a nap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after glu@@ ing , you go to bed at its normal time .
in addition to the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ go@@ g@@ gles , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger .
in addition , a camera on the ceiling draws the sleeping end .
how can those affected handle the problems ?
there are quite a few adjusting screws which can be used for better sleep .
there is one thing that counts : regular sleeping and sti@@ cking times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV for falling asleep , avoid alcohol and do not watch out at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is absolutely not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp has with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook for the dis@@ ap@@ pointing cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he took gold for the first time at the World Championships in Doh@@ a and at the same time set up his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler has placed himself on Facebook against his ex @-@ team @-@ colleagues who have been critic@@ ised for his criticism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic Champion will receive € 20,000 bonus and one Jung@@ le King 15@@ 0.000 € no one should be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old on his Facebook page on Friday night . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the transport system in swimming sports is bad , the dop@@ ing controls , on the other hand , very good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look closely or even operate on the subject of dop@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Deutschland ( NA@@ DA ) .
that &apos;s exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you cannot control a certain time before WM / OS from independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A , you must not take part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the election Hamburg , who meanwhile operates an ice cream par@@ lor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : bonds of luggage are det@@ ained
professional thi@@ eves at the Düsseldorf airport
the police of the Düsseldorf police managed to arrest two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years on Thursday .
the susp@@ ects had , as gangs , committed several hand@@ ker@@ chief and baggage theft .
at 9.@@ 30 p.m. civil servants in the area of the airport of Düsseldorf recognized a gang that was known to the polic@@ emen from past attacks of theft .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences this year since mid @-@ July and were involved in a joint , industri@@ ous and particularly professional manner .
the specialists of the Crime Com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can demonstrate four acts to the thi@@ eves who had entered Germany specifically to commit crimes .
they had over 15,000 Euros in total .
old buildings , a few lin@@ den trees , in between still a remnant of cob@@ ble@@ stones : the Riga road in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in looks not like that at first sight , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if one walks east from east to west , one passes by play@@ grounds , a fres@@ co@@ ed kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ aden .
someone &quot; ugly ! &quot; spra@@ yed on the facade of a grey house .
in front of a Li@@ dl , which is to be demol@@ ished soon , it will be built : a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here by 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , is , however , preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rental contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and used for events .
since the beginning of the year , particularly Berlin &apos;s inner sen@@ ator Henkel has repeatedly declared a tough action by the police against the project , the area referred to as a &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
after clearing the premises on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ets s@@ mi@@ ths , with 300 police officers , on 22 June , the police pat@@ rolled up official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , locked sections of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
in the meantime , the building workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court decided that the clearance was illegal , and a day later police and construction workers removed from the ju@@ g of sympath@@ isers and residents .
on this summer afternoon , the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk in front of Sp@@ ät@@ i .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
left violence is not the main concern of many local residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who raises three children here , is mainly irrit@@ ated by the police presence .
with the residents of the house projects they share the concern for rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , who mostly wanted police protection from v@@ and@@ ali@@ zing lef@@ ti@@ sts .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin inner sen@@ ator and the police force between the occup@@ ants and their neighbors , apparently does not exist .
Friedrichsha@@ in , in the East of Berlin , was actually a traditional working @-@ class neighborhood which even today has a low average in comparison to the rest of the city and has a high risk of poverty .
in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer Straße in the vicinity of the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer was evacu@@ ated under large police orders in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the neighborhood has become a magnet for tourists and elec@@ tors from all over the world over the past few years : with them residents from the GDR times and former occup@@ ants share their neighbourhood .
this is also reflected in the r@@ ents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them at dis@@ car@@ ded discs or freshly painted faç@@ ades , which have been ki@@ cked with paint bags .
no other road was mentioned this year as often as the words &quot; Left Autonom@@ ous Viol@@ ence . &quot;
one reason why not all neighbours view this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as physical assault are , according to statistics , almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
most of the crimes are made of material damage , which tend to hit the new@@ buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a ten@@ ancy house next to the controversial 94 , there can be no question of uncertainty .
as far as violence is concerned , it is important : people in the 94 are their neighbours , they were certainly not .
even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Riga Castle anymore .
for the studied architect , her road is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is consciously drawn into the Riga road - and remained .
that &apos;s why it was so important to her that the residents get their way back : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district .
but in the eyes of the inhabitants such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former buildings , which disp@@ lace the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are ultimately con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many - here are more people who are not so well searched , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely cannot appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what do you want to do if you never listen to someone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , also with the police and the inhabitants .
for zo@@ oming , who like color bombs , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
those who come from should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a ta@@ vern area , can complain about noise .

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the new Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact for integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee commission@@ er for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social pedago@@ gue supports the administration of Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as a contact person for all actors : refugees , working group refugee aid , administration , authorities and who else is involved .
Reg@@ ine Customer of the working group indicated that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the lifel@@ ong Woll@@ ch@@ sau , which has above all a problem .
this meant that some - less ridi@@ cul@@ ously rather than on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write down the job .
looking for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just an experienced Woll@@ mer@@ ch@@ sau .
but administrative work is not its central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le says .
above all , it is about organisation , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent position for three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
new containers soon to be placed in Was@@ en@@ straße
a serious problem has been for some time to find housing for the connecting refugees that have been recognized .
the local authorities are responsible for the connection .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the administrative office to the municipality and job center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
in fact , the administration does not find private apartments .
it does not function until now , whether it is dependent on private dwell@@ ings , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common apartments need to be in@@ timi@@ dated as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will soon be installed in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
prospect is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent residence there are intern@@ ships , training centres , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and aid activities for refugees and migrants who need to be repaired or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; Reg@@ ine Customer reports .
many work in the yard or help house masters , do non@@ profit work - and that is motivated and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community will result in a positive external effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not mean only work .
the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and Client .
people should develop a sense of belonging .
so I need special offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so here too , administration and honorary officials jump here .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcomed and welcomed in Germany .
the long duration of the proceedings is a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they need to explain to the refugees that it just takes time and can bridge time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever will some@@ day develop the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , may not work and be useless , he will never integrate himself .
the clear majority is motivated .
however , there are also problems , says customer hon@@ estly , &quot; people with whom nothing works . &quot; therefore , the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and the customer is always to motiv@@ ate others .
all this is already a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
a difficult question : do the two after the latest incidents fear ra@@ dic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer clearly states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some nai@@ ve might call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a residual risk can and may not exclude them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these incidents are also subject to the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were afraid that the assass@@ ins would call them completely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so the main and honorary officials have to look for activities locally and in the region .
