<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer with some colleagues looked for some diversion with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old, it was a premiere.</seg>

<seg id="11">He let himself be led by his family through the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even hover for photographic purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and therewith also with the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was absolutely convincing.</seg>

<seg id="16">Silver laurel leaf, Champions Tour-Player of the year...</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade deal - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential candidates are not at odds with regard to tax and energy policy, as well as in a fundamental principle.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are fundamental, rather philosophical.</seg>
<seg id="5">That, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep those in doubt small and cautions about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to tax the economy and regulate it to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself would be quite different, claims Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will massively return regulations and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for businesses." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has to fulfil certain tasks, it has disadvantaged opportunities to open up and needs money for it.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why the taxes on the rich would increase, they say.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In order to invest, Trump and Clinton say almost word-like.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the state-critical tea party wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So there could be party internal discussions on Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more clear.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump is planning to build coal-fired power plants and re-use coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, he wants to terminate the Paris Climate Protection Agreement." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "with its investment program, Clinton, on the other hand, intends to expand renewable energies and demand:" "" "a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only with the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazifish trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both the US do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should be paid better, e.g. Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of US $7.25 is a starvation.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump is about to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must rise up, he says he cannot be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the months ahead is likely to be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand stands Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics point to him that the budget deficit would only be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand Clinton stands, who wants at least from the rich to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich women's aid.</seg>

<seg id="41">In some common shelters in Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia, there are only common shelters or own houses for single women and their children.</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of the assistance physicians have called upon their union to approve new work combat measures in their dispute regarding a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) demanded its entire advice to approve more labour action measures from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC asserted that ministers had agreed to address the concerns about the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">In July, assistance practitioners and medical students voted in favour of the rejection of a contract agreed with by the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was rejected by 58% of its members voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a letter to the members who were posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government had "persistently quiet" problems, which led to the rejection of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "In view of this, the JDC committee voted in favour of rejecting the proposed new treaty and requesting official renegotiations for all your concerns." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In response to the silence of the government, the JDC board today filed a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating labour action measures beginning in early September.</seg>
<seg id="10">The dispute caused assistance physicians to strike six times this year, the first complete cases in the history of the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="11">The head of the BMA assistance physician Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed contract terms which were recommended by the BMA.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to announce an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I can't deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile was narrower and he radiated hardly any heat, even for his restrained circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "however, Recep Tayyip Erdogan said repeatedly of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report whole five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but can even be improved.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if something bad had never happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's embezzling, sustainable cows showed that Russia's head of state had not forgotten anything.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shooting of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was incinerated.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin denounced and accused Ankara of falling behind Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater since it was celebrated by a putative friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Building up the cousy will be difficult if not impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state controlled media carried out a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The most serious accusations led by senior officials that Erdogan had benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has vehemently denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdogan to hear him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could record a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan mainly needs all the friends he can get after he has lost almost his office last month with a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shocked him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists every year to the Turkish coast.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number dropped by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal attack on the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti put it as follows:" "" "tourists there, tomatoes there long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious on the West, as it looks at its response to the attempted takeover of power as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "this is due to the ongoing grudge about the EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce Turkey's relationship to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, the Russian head of state gained a bonus for the fact that after the attempted coup d "état he demanded support for the elected state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep sense of fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this dazzling palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to demonstrate, as an analyst once described to me, "An Alliance of outsiders": two countries that feel discouraged and treated badly by the West and are now allied.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role of a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents met at the press conference saying that they had not even stripped the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to stress it.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and considering the potential for a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian combat jet, it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin sacked Chief of staff Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin recently dismissed Sergei Ivanov's Chief of Staff.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV has been part of Putin's most intimate circle for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for environmental and transport matters.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in a statement of the Kremlin, it is said that Putin has ordered the release of Ivanovs from his duties as president of the Russian presidential administration without giving reasons." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who was the Ivanovs Substitute since 2012, was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin's website it is called (in Russian) that he was later the logchief and chief of staff of the government personnel.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the government's most important task to support your action as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov was asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the smiling faces convince you?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mystical.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was one of the closest colleagues Vladimir Putin for a long time and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But in spite of the smile for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion that a man who once was promoted as a potential president, at once would like to guide Russian environmental policy, met with great skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, who are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said: "it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - complaining posts for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as President of the KGB state security service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was the Chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin reached power, he called Ivanov one of five people he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become President of Russia because a third term was violating Putin's constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another close ally Putins, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before becoming president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four locks of the" "" "cover blowers" "", "approaching completion by each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>

<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown reported a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to move from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensboard crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic extent in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate work requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">Overall, almost 79% of the total bridge deck is at their place and the last section of Decks today gets a concrete shot for the deck in Rosyth, meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "Michael Martin, project manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" "" "the first closure represents a significant milestone in each bridge project." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of future-oriented civil engineering and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the existing north tower deck, we had to close the existing gap on the north or landside.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very sensitive activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massively, because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs around 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate since the tolerances on which the team worked were tiny - on each side they were just a few millimeters.</seg>

<seg id="1">Who builds the cheap apartments of Braunschweig?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and the Greens are saying: investors should take much stronger responsibility in the future.</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "the SPD proposes a" "" "action concept for housing" "" "for the next council session." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">But quarrel is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First of all, the question is: who should build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "SPD leader Christoph Bratmann believes:" "" "we agree with the Greens: if you want to build urban areas, you will have to pay 20 percent of all apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">The cheap apartments, however, can also arise in the continuance.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "however, the big dispute in the town hall is, as viola:" "" "how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors to build on such areas at least 10 percent, but as much as 20 percent of the housing as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "a new urban housing development programme that will cost millions and still have to be financed should provide incentives." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "the problem, said Bratmann:" "" "there is no agreement currently between the factions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few rules as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harder conditions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Despite this, viola, a tightening of the situation on the housing market is vanished.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the action concept is implemented, this will ensure additional tasks in the building administration.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program is not yet complete: for the 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you compensate for the loss of more around 1300 favourable apartments, whose funding will expire in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, according to the planning spokesperson Nicole Palm, current ties should now be purchased from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought to bring apartments back into the price relationship.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">In one fell swoop the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the west city there are deadlines for the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 homes you could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: they do not want the owners, the housing associations.</seg>
<seg id="30">For if the number of social housing in the West is increased again drastically, it is removed from the goal of so-called mix-up.</seg>
<seg id="31">There should not be a concentration of socially disadvantaged in only a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens are counting on the fact that there will still be movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "group leader Holger Herlitschke says:" "" "for a broad majority, the CDU must go into the boat." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness worth</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children are no longer allowed to play outside, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring on screens has been complained of many over the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and last on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s (later an animated series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop culture phenomena, interest in the release of the game in the US, Australia and New Zealand declined in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overburdened the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and once they have been found, "photographed" (over a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured" can be captured.</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the delusion and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the United States, the game has led to a considerable increase in steps that the "average" person withdraws every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, tracking 35.000 users, announced the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of followed people who train every day 30 minutes, from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who is playing the Pokémon Go - it merely watches the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns that people want to make "take 30 minutes" to "get away from the sofa" and "to be active every day" have deaf ears, because many public messages about health are boring and come from people looking miserable.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, the importance of sports cannot be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Whoever pushes sports regularly reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Exercise helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderfull of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Three pillars of health are thus covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even join in new friendships during the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also rayrian game perishops who have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk around a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it supposed to do?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough occurred.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if Smartphone Apps like Fitbit could already track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sport as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and use it with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemons's success there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="2">Forget the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="3">Forget the hype.</seg>
<seg id="4">Simone Biles is immune to all that.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dynamic on the jumping horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortless on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breathtaking on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="8">Brilliant throughout the line.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally also Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast came to the multi-stage title on Thursday and increased the gap between himself and the rest of the world under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Their overall result was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and Final Five "team cameradin Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American women Simone Biles turnt on the balance beam during the individual competition of women in the gymnastics of the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual Americanist who wins a multi-stage title and overall the fifth while she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated the last three years, 15 world medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion from 1984 Mary Lou Reson told her that she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It was awaiting them a final test in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athlete, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not to return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be regarded as disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American women Simone Biles, on the left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after they have won gold and silver in the individual multi-marathon of women in the gymnastics at the 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as exclamation mark on the farewell ceremony of the team co-ordinator Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted on never having planned the future during its long way, it is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical tumbling pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted as a small child by her grandparents and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school excursion into the gym in which Boorman trained, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, it has not lost a competition competition, a series of victories that will last as long as Biles wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if Mustafina was easy to lead through two turns, the image was deceiving.</seg>
<seg id="27">Swedish and Bodenturnen - in which Biles holds the world title - lusted.</seg>
<seg id="28">She got back with 15,433 on the balance beam again - and with a 15,933 on the floor, she was sitting on it.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman hugged her softly when she expected her end result - pure formality - and tears streaming on Biles brilliantly red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collection book became a reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance of Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago, when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake went to Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time the 22-year-old team captain, called "Oma" by the Americans, had a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After her ground exercise she threw down cuscues to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="33">As far as Biles is concerned, the rapidly spreading Tweet of the 19-year-olds has a completely new meaning from the beginning of this week:</seg>

<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis subsidiary Maleah were shot on 12 June, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.</seg>

<seg id="10">The investigators refused to expose the evidence they concluded that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heavy rains and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to call on the emergency stand on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Numerous rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi flooded their banks and threatened with large flooding after extreme rainfalls, the National Weather Service reported.</seg>
<seg id="4">The governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards announced that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and help the communities affected.</seg>

<seg id="21">Hansford said he and his family members had all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim.</seg>
<seg id="22">Hansford said Nothelfer had saved all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were accommodated until Friday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Krautmann said that" "" "the flooding" "" "had spread rapidly because there were still heavy rainfalls and that the authorities considered evacuation instructions." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I present to myself under the women's olympionship in the gymnastics and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, since 1984 I have been part of every summer Olympics and the USA have never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second, this team has three female gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin colors.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess, and Madison Kocian, which is catholic, makes everybody proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This crew finally reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one among female female gymnasts was an Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year, Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic meddman and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterly gymastics routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual Americanist who won gold at an individual multi-stage event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won Silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but gymnastics in the whole country do not look like this.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "", "because the next Olympic team will only have four female players in the team. in addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and Turner is primarily involved in private sports clubs which are maintained by parents who come up for training, training, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gymnastics lie in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the gymnasts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they started the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to get inspired by countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, offering a more affordable and easily accessible gymnastics training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my 20-year institution.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events we offered free and affordable Turns in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youths (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September, we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer youth high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It's the inspiration of this team that attracts thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in the sport, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this genuine portrayal of "Girl Power" by holding the Olympic team gold and thanks, so many young girls with different backgrounds are motivated to start their way, healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="3">The anticoagulant drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.</seg>

<seg id="7">About 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of it is suffering from another heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the artery walls that form floorings.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the flooring breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that stops the flow of blood to the heart and thereby causes a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">When the blood clots dissolve, it can flow through the flow of blood and clog the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">Persons who had already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk to have another.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, which is produced by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more likely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The draft Bill of NICE, which was published today recommends a 12 month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all persons who have suffered a heart attack have a further heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">The fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person.</seg>
<seg id="16">Experience shows that Ticagrelor is effective in combination with aspirin to reduce further heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">By a provisional recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who benefit.</seg>

<seg id="2">The former mayor of Tower Hamlet Lutry Rahman was removed last year due to corruption from ministry due to corruption</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of political Correctness has led to widespread ignoring of widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities as a devastating government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and town councils to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse due to" "" "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="7">At present, a voter only has to name his name and address.</seg>

<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets electoral campaign in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special electoral court ruled that the incumbent mayor Lutry Rahman should be relieved of illegal and illegal practices of his office after a litany.</seg>
<seg id="14">The court found that Rahman would have perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia.</seg>

<seg id="18">In particular, he voiced alarm for the fraudulent choice of letters when the older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to elect a candidate of their election.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, depicted, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including leading expressions to prove the identity</seg>

<seg id="3">We talked with Rhone Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to turn the skewer for your robber.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "if you are approaching from behind you should turn as first to see your attacker and" "" "go out of the firing line," "" "says Mizrachi." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Then take the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then strike it with the knee in the bar and twist, while the aggressor bows against pain, the weapon from his hands. strike it with the barrel in the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on it.</seg>
<seg id="8">With attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot, grab the gun and twist it, so that the Attacker can't shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, shift the weight to the weapon and hit the aggressor on the chest, then twist the weapon out of its handle before they move backwards and raise the weapon to it.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller stripped his immune system and the threshing of a serious test - by dragging some of Europe's dirtiest and disgusting places.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk disdained his course on a euro note, a handrail at Piccadilly Circus, a flush-mounted toilet and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before the lick of every object, he used a luminous to show himself and us what he is going to get in.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was infiltrated under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to light.</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea of removing the ushing button of a pulling toilet that has been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals on the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing he licked up left more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his bowels by travelling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public money stations to railway stations to rinsing knobs of toilets, the task set up his immune system definitely below a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the film he said:" "" "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and mud water." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he was justified in his call.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he leaned was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial model showed a luminometry number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">By comparison, the luminometry number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet which he refused to lick off after its luminometry number exceeded 4000 units while fresh washed hands exhibit one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," showing the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says," "" "This is close to the worst thing I have smelled in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dishonor than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm not going to lick here anything, because here it is disgusting inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "" "we really wanted to offer consumers something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "we conducted crazy brainstorming that ended with saying" "" "Let's call Ian." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them in a greater context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "let me say so - I lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I had told him to lick, just like the faulty Russian toilet, which is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick her and others where this was pretty difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015 84 percent of all respondents lactic acid bacteria associated with the well being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that they use at least occasional products containing added lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the electoral and final holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern once again has to pass election campaign close to the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's all about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strongly newcomer AfD cuts and what remains in the end coalitions dusty.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one sees from his big posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the countryside, distributes roses and chat a little with the people, just as his legendary eloquent predecessor Harald Ringstorff also did.</seg>

<seg id="18">The CDU, with its top candidate, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to make election campaign at the wrong time at the right place.</seg>
<seg id="19">She invited chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale environments; Merkel's constituency is located in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group didn't agree, there were more Nordrhein-Westfalen, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania.</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority from other federal states," complained Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in NDR.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.</seg>
<seg id="23">Apart from that, the Nordost-CDU largely refrains from the usual election campaigns at market places and in front of shopping malls with parasols and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">That, says Kokert, only plays a "subordinate role."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union also noted that in the country you are crumbling on the ground that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people.</seg>

<seg id="30">At the election of 2011, the SPD gained a clear margin of 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>

<seg id="2">At the speed with which the B 27 is renovated, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for the construction work, which start at 5.30 in the morning and only end at 8 o'clock in the morning, there is always praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "they've done everything pretty crispy," "" "says Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet petrol station." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is also no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site could be relocated to the south as planned at the beginning of the week, and everything will be ready by the end of October.</seg>
<seg id="8">The receipt of the work for the construction works is also vowed, for example when it comes to the establishment of emergency services.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site had migrated to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the Aspergstraße in Odondingen was lifted and thus also the connection to Rottenburg, the traffic situation within the place has relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now move from Odondingen from the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The evasive movement through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were some considerable problems," said Florian King, the head office manager responsible for the transport management of the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachmannstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many Schleicherooms were looking for and rather trusted their Navi as the signposting.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks were fringed in residential areas.</seg>

<seg id="19">Since the construction site has moved on, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the business people at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is now open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 refurbishment has led to revenue outbreaks, allows everyone to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "those who have less to do with the" "" "end customer" "" "are therefore produced for other companies, for which the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences." ""</seg>

<seg id="26">The most popular are the bars along the street.</seg>

<seg id="28">This is already existential threat.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "not only him but all the restaurants have" "" "hit hard." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="34">He had to leave half of his employees.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, District President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from Göhner if there is a financial compensation, with the hint that the restaurant profits otherwise from the advantages of the situation on the B 27. now, it must also bear the disadvantages that result from the renovation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties where something more generous was handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been settled here since 1715, pointing to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">The fact that other regular guests are now less frequently missed due to complicated traffic guidance, he can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't drive, it is also elsewhere nice.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubt that his family clientele returns after the refurbishment works.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and avian flu, Göhner thinks the impact of the B 27 construction works on his clientele for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its many years of history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work, that's brutal.</seg>

<seg id="6">Despite its many brands and some well-running markets, Europe's largest car manufacturer can still advance a plus in spite of its many brands and some well-run markets.</seg>

<seg id="9">In Western Europe alone, after China was the second-largest market, sales were 14 percent below the prior-year figure.</seg>

<seg id="16">All in all, the most affected branch of the Niedersachsen is already marginally affected by the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only an extradition of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is available.</seg>
<seg id="17">Group sales director Fred Kappler was able to advance a sales platform from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">At this time, Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles, 5,904 million worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had tampered with a software exhaust test.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany alone, VW is calling approximately 2.5 million cars for retrofitting into the workshops.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the course of retrofitting, Volkswagen confirmed that the conversion of the cars had no negative effects.</seg>

<seg id="1">Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee demands punitive interest rates from rich savers in future - as a second institute in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="2">"" "on Thursday, bank manager Josef Paul said:" "" "it is only about 139 customers that park 40 million euros on sight deposit or day money accounts." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="4">If banks are spending money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they must pay their 0.4 percent penalty.</seg>
<seg id="5">This fee requires the Raiffeisenbank Gmund to withdraw from private and corporate customers for deposits of more than 100,000 euros in cash or day money accounts.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "the first 100,000 euros are free." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "the next 100,000 in the future will cost 400 euros a year," "" "said Paul." ""</seg>

<seg id="11">According to the polluter-pays principle, the costs now continue.</seg>
<seg id="12">Leaving the cash in the Raiffeisen Bank's safes would be far too dangerous: "I have already experienced four attacks, I don't like the fifth!" said the Chief Executive Officer.</seg>
<seg id="13">Most customers would have understood and changed to other forms of investment.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men of middle aged love boards.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you hasten to the comment section, to reamend him under the pseudonym Non-Allemancy of Male Damage with harsh insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the much discussed redevelopment of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to Midlife-nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who bought recently a record are all foresight at the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older drummers tend to retain their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov right?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog was a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit before I stop, holding my hands and saying something like "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - still there is still a handful of fantastic record specialist shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the camera man to switch off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, dem ich von Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (number of data: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I already appreciate," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4.000 records.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I didn't follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford than they appeared and buy items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought was probably too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink so much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets on the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media puppy, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations that I have conducted, people usually get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica, to realize that record shops offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers accepted the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record sleeves, from items that evoke happy memories of youth.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of emptiness or possessions of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "" "said WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is like a collector so and I think that it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "an employee flirts from a stack of plates." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey by ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet heard them.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use while 7% of those who buy a record have no record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried as I flatten out a stack of Bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (number of people: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came just recently and said," I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead sound record so I can put them into the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musicastic.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say," "" "I have no record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones who are only slowly coming in.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has dedicated the records almost an entire floor, has a blower audience than I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above mentioned stores - Wild Beasts's newest synthesizer and sextary pop instead of experimental jazz from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but stressful psychological trauma is hard to detect if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the store for a few minutes and looks at the variety of records available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">She rather makes a shop window than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "it is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is..." "" "she drives away with a dearted sigh." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I am pretending to smuggle the jeans-hot pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls grouping for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a ley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could ship to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group, who has more time and money than others, is the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as records.</seg>
<seg id="61">Although my research has shown that the results of YouGov are right, at least in record shops in Soho, they disregard the large number of female collectors that exist in reality, record shops and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They will certainly not spend their Thursday mornings with marbles through records of Berwick Street and the sheets by platters, while they avoid the staring look of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator who rises above the shoulders of no middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="1">French court rejects offer on demolition of shops in the refugee camp</seg>
<seg id="2">A French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary shops in which individuals within the camp would sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefecture argued that these places were to be broken down because they would constitute a parallel economy out of which no taxes would be paid and which contain a fire and sanity risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups told the Court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people running the 72 temporary businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the Calais prefecture were "absolutely understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "the judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafés and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely feeding people living" "" "living in extremely precarious conditions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer quiet meetings between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by the collapse was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is operated in general and 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as a consultation on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "in a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure was" "" "for these children of a catastrophe, of which the youngest eight years are old." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The two relief organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of migrants living in the jungle camps had risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number so far - after a steep increase of newcomers during the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's racers have to adapt to the next generation speed measurers: in different federal states, including in Hessen and Brandenburg, new flash units are tested, which should overrun tempos.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic Enforcement trailers of the Vitronic company from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at accident centers, where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, on motorway construction sites or to renovating bridges with temporary speed limit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a stationary f-glitter to meet the speed limit.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days in case of continuous measurement operations; the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">Laser measurement technology enables all vehicles to be recorded simultaneously across multiple tracks simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits as well as driving bans after time, lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the high-raised condition, the trailer can be moved by car with trailer hitch according to the manufacturer.</seg>
<seg id="10">So that it is not simply clicked, it is lowered in the measuring mode, so that the wheels in the armored and by the way also shot-proof outer shell disappear.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition, a built-in alarm system should protect the glitter against vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since 2015, the trailer has been tested according to information from Vitronic in different federal states and is now also used.</seg>

<seg id="1">Britain recovers silver in the 7-er Rugby after Fiji Masterclass takes gold</seg>
<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at the 7-star rugby reached an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in Fijis on Thursday evening, when they were hit with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji granted a master class in handling, side-step ping, back, line and roher power to win Gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was lost through the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth this day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of this, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least a Briton tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, they lost every game under Ryan at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This flap will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderful and kicked off the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if you were running in driving buses. the World Series winners went up 5-0, when Osea Kolinisau echoed in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With only four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuvi added another attack from the right corner he turned.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A pivotal fight against Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, Merathalua turned a touch down in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the restarted and there was still over a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravoutrau plunged through more weak tacklings of the UK team and stormed up to the line to make a fool.</seg>
<seg id="20">The transformation took a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.</seg>
<seg id="22">That's how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB conducted fundamental changes to half-time and closed the fijian gap... for a whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua passed Tuisova after a brilliant interim play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB, made a touchdown on the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was long in favor of the South Seas, whose fans sang, wave flags and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Vililady put the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The fijis sounded, the Fijis hugged and the UK kicked down in the lawns.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day, Fiji Japan defeated 20-5 in semi-finals and Britain pushed South Africa into a tight half-finals match from the race - Britain's conversion of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown got the Boks in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a score among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant later tackling by Marcus Watson, Anthony of the English 15-Aside Team, secured the winning - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fight with the coach's cancer</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no more emotinal gold than with these games, and that will mean something.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first stroke to the last, 220 tough pieve, which enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only those who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the coach Robin Williams, was all present when they rowed for the second Olympic-old in the second without a tax-woman, the first women in the history of British sports, who laid such a benchmark.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her dominance was absolutely, after all her 39th inexorable use, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant female athletes who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the nature of the triumphal march.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that make the difference and there was no one better than the trainer who did not know 30 months ago if he would survive this day at all, when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer that is operable and that did it.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you don't do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little bit the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if this is the right term at all.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to get better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around at the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing is a challenge, but it makes it an even bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of victory her first thoughts came to Williams, who spent a nerve wrecking morning doing something more than anything else and trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "panning, which was the captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said," "" "I was an emotional wreck this week. this is perhaps a bit extreme, but it means so much." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It just repeats how much this means, how much I and Helen and Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him. he is the best trainer in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have asked for a better person for training or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning never lost a race over the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters when the teams started from New Zealand and Denmark, panning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>

<seg id="7">"" "the work of the Veitenstein Group calls" "" "Bavaria far as exemplary." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="8">Behind all this, Rupert Göller, who worked for 31 years in the Zweckverband employee, is 28 years as Managing Director.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Drinking Water Board of the Veitenstein Group, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, transports approximately 150,000 cubic metres of water per year and provides 32 places and hamlet with about 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">The congregations are the congregations of Kirchheimer, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are water delivery contracts for other towns and villages.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairperson, Breitbrunn's mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zweckverband in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water line construction and maintenance work through office and organisational activities, budgeting planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends" "", "said the chairman." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">As an outstanding event, she named the start-up and inauguration of the new fountain (1994), property purchases in the area of the new well (1998) and compensation for farmers, the renovation of the high containers (1999), the re-purchase of a central computer control system (2004) and the reengineering of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There have been no standstill and there have always been new additions because water means living and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her laudation she commended Göllers loyal, reliable and correct service for over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">It has been used with a lot of heart blood for its water-purpose association and it has really lived the water-purpose association as if it were its own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein Group on nitrate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Franconia district.</seg>
<seg id="20">For this he received very much recognition and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller, for his part, praised Water Management Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best water wart and he was a faithful cracker.</seg>

<seg id="25">The biggest challenge and the most difficult operation were the tubular rupture at the high reservoir in Kirchhön on a third of January.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night, so that the localities could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">Also the supply of new brunn can be maintained once because one filled the high container of Pettstadt with hoses.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Lichtblick for the German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-packed and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared from additional costs in millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that the industry threatened with green electricity are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains with the exemption from the Renewable Energy Survey at the existing facilities for the so-called self-power production in the German steel industry, "said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung "(WAZ, Friday edition).</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "I am really happy that we could finally reach after two years of tough negotiations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators are replaced in the steel works is an EEG levelling of 20 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even this will not be raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall has welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on self-electricity production.</seg>
<seg id="12">As a result, the status quo of the previous regulation is largely determined.</seg>

<seg id="17">Since the financial crisis of 2008, the steel industry in Europe suffers from overcapacity and a considerable price pressure.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the past year, the situation further intensified as the world's largest producer of producer China threw up massive steel on the world market in view of the ailing domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation has somewhat relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, import duties imposed on import steel show effect, on the other hand, the economic outlook in China has increased.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price pick-up is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least the prices had stagnated.</seg>
<seg id="25">The sector responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">Last but not least, ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude the closing of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the end of 2015, some 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, the German steel producers are cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.</seg>
<seg id="29">With 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year's month, as the Steel Economy announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a short upliftment in May, the quantity produced was now back for the second month in a row.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has been around two percent below the previous year's figure.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the coming months, the association expects an improvement in order volumes thanks to an improved order situation.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing is good for seniors</seg>
<seg id="2">The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp her whole life: she was a young girl in the school choir, in the Lehramt studies she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in an elderly choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing brings me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and a total of living, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way she does something good about her health and her spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because Singen is a great hobby for seniors straight from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German Senior League.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular meetings, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Social and family structures often dissolve in old age, then a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "to speak and organize oneself, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For this, seniors train deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand his lungs are not so fast out of the box in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">Singing often has a very special effect on older people, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Working Group of the Seniors Organizations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations the common singing had a much higher priority, it was part of everyday life, both in school and leisure time, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz frequently observes that singing or listening to songs in older people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their adolescence.</seg>
<seg id="18">With lyrics and especially melodies, people who have dementia are self-denial for long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, a special performance is required for the head, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">Focusing simultaneously on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially older people who live alone exercise to concentrate not only on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "another positive aspect is the recognition you hear through singing in the choir," "" "says Hackler." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The feeling of self-esteem increases by singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I practise for a long time, I will be better and more vigilant over me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">There are plenty of good reasons to start singing.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you want to try a new hobby, don't hesitate - even if you think you have little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who can hear when a sound goes wrong?</seg>
<seg id="29">Looking for a suitable offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a retirement home, you can simply join them.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many towns also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many people's choirs may also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those who do not have access to the internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors to help with the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who want to sing should definitely join a choir, advise Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating - that applies to any age.</seg>

<seg id="18">It is too early to express themselves on possible motives - but probably the acts of Muslim rebels are likely to act.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical for the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist uprising movement or terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is only local sabotage which limits itself to limited areas and provinces," "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">On the contrary, it is assumed that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "in recent days the authorities would have received confidential information on forthcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they had not been informed of the exact time and places." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is hiding behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police found their officials in the country to enhance security around important government buildings, airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand, there are repeatedely smaller bombings, but mostly they are not against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin is a palace used for years by Thailands King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">Following the well-known bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and its surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="30">After clashes between the security forces and Muslim populations, there will be no necessary trips to these provinces.</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday were a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This also gives the military a great influence in the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta boss and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs had been an attempt to create chaos while the country faces stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military unta, who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, remembers himself to have led the kingdom again to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Almost one year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stroke at a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>

<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filtering tool, it enables snapchat around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders on the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can transform yourself into an pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be made of a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are unblooming, self-rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All false entrances reach the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the past, Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in which they were charged that the app would promote blackface or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week suggested some users a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called it a racist cartoon by Asians - "yellow face."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has a diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it would have deactivated the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended to pay homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism recalled the filter of vulnerable clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others opposed the Anime Comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail, Grace wrote asparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widely circulated across the photos that the filter was "vulnerable and easy to say."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the juxtaposition of a very reluctant Asian caricature and filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow face has been moved to the end of the extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural stumps.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats great audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race as their older counterpart - might be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">When one of Snapchats filters creates an image that is insulting to a user, "it is much more difficult that such things go unnoticed than it used to be," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, who works as product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for media and in a telephone interview, she said that they believe that race-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in setting practices for Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the mostly white, only male leadership and finished their essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either she has no different representation of people with other skin colors in their staff so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that has largely unanswered Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise.</seg>

<seg id="6">"" "" "" "what happened at the CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," "" "said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">The management errors in the CentCom range up to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in training Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts face the pressure from their superiors to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements in front of the Congress were considerably more positive than it corresponds to the facts" "" "stated the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigation, it's so clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the Central Command points changed the intelligence reports to downplay the danger posed by ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The republicans called the Task Force to life after it was played that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights as the investigation continues.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of the CentCom reports are under way by the Ministry of Defense's General Inspector.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday, consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "in 2014 and 2015, the CentCom created an overly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," "" "announced the highest level Demokrat in the Committee of Representatives, member of the representative house Adam B. Schiff, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process, Mr Schiff," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "accused the morals of analyst and" "" "gave too little room for divergent opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of a White House intervention in the CentCom Analyst with regard to a "definite political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the Congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon general inspector who was accepted after complaints from CentCom Analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on any reports of the Congress, while the investigation of the General Inspector was still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he also stated that "experts sometimes have diverging opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that intelligence services and the ministry of defense welcome controversial discussions on these important issues of national defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions for the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that has since been made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, last year's allegations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State recall the intermediate activities of more than ten years ago, when a centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush presented only a small crew in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in rising up against the current reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, Mr. Hooker's team stated that according to government officials, contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the terrorist group's financial position, as these provisional refineries were put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This recognition, however, was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">CentCom's commander, GM Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature for his excessive positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin was retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after firing three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games were supposed to be a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she couldn't remember what ever did.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "I have no idea." "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">I am not one of the people who keep their doors in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">But she knows this: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Britons on the first place, who are undefeated after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final match of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter final, the game will decide which of the two will win the first and second place within their group of six teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed one will follow the strong Dutch slightly longer out of the way that the other group will lead.</seg>
<seg id="10">Whatever the game is going to end on Saturday, the Americans have fired up a surprising muddle because of their success story, four years after they landed in the last London Games on the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time with three years she had a hockey club in her hands (her two older sisters played sports at Drexel University), with 16 years she became national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">It missed the Olympics in 2008 because it could not qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012 in which everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the National Team, began to turn things into a better place.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "a cultural change, a mental change and a physical shift," "" "said Bam." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">We didn't have the workload in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have been able to get rid of the rudder completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening, Bam opened the door row in the first half of the game with a backstop from the close range.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone into the game without winning the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She ran a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled in the middle and knocked the ball in the gate to give the American a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the US, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position" said Parnham, but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the middle of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of trampolines</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and inevitable, a fast relay race between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning staff, which is handed down from the Crossbow to the float to the turner for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't switch on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's chat in the queue, without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the quarrel between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympics and a swarm of women with dimples, could have been among those well-known names sent to Prime Time by sponsors and well-being TV advertising, if he would be a swimmer, gymnast or even fencer.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights gold in the Olympic trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event equally.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, some in the shade are the sports which are not generally accepted: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast-swimming and may it rule for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I would like to make a modest argument for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, it was perceived so sparsely for the last 16 years that many of those who asked me did not know that it is an Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, there has never been a medal in jumping on the trampoline and until 2012 had an athlete who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and Russians are inclined to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend her Gold Medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than that sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a devoted enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonish trembling of its never-ending bouncing - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports which essentially unites them.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means" "" "jumping-board" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Aspiring winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, holding and balance) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "according to the official Olympic program, they are rated for performance, difficulty and" "" "flight time" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists need to continue in their quest for gold, faster, up and down, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down at the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They not only chase the finish line or the output wall, but also another height target in the television broadcast: that of the world or the olympic byte.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented quest is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it's enough to even beat a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel tired even when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then downwards, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">Here too there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during practice there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant suspension of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final hours of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming around 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final hours as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can be achieved only by the apprehension and the objective of male athletes - as the male US-Turner suggested recently according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley is expecting his new fan community.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long is an ally of the USA</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters calling for political changes in Ethiopia pushed the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses testified that dozens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police when they were shot.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years it was one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government shook the country and expanded into ever-increasing areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week, thousands of people hit the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the government's response was relentless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses testified that policemen shot and killed tens of unarmed protesters.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos on the protests which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security people hit young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights authority now demands a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will even become even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Africa International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services work closely with Ethiopians to combat terror hazards beyond the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations continued to lead repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restrained, and dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or prison, killed or driven to the wigs of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you oppress people and have no other options but protesting, it breaks out," "" "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold in relation to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists, such as the Oromo Liberation Front, or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, have been forced more or less in recent years to use turmoil and rearm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness may explode after years of getting into the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was only in recent years that many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media, as cheaper smartphones became more and more common and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still can communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians held that they were so protesting.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amperas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amperas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons the Amperas prospered, who come from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian high countries, in politics and economics, while they exploited the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are going to co-ordinate under a screen," "" "said Mulatu Chanechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The greatest protests took place in the areas of Ampera and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is fairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and is dominant in the military, intelligence services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, until his death on a disease that was not made public in 2012 was 17 years in Ethiopia's prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of discontent and using special officers to manipulate opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this basic skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively intransparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Contrary to Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of North Ethiopian, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia had witnessed such upheaval was in 2005 after thousands of protests were protesting which, according to analysts, were apparently pledged by the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following raids many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train and for their measurable progress in poverty reduction." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal abuse of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnical form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters in Gondar, an amharic city, managed by Tigray led businesses and hatred against the tigrians becomes more and more common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests are bringing the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over neighboring Somalia, even though it recently reported that it closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While Westerners clearly want to support democracy, he does not want his ally collapsing in an already volatile area.</seg>
<seg id="59">"" "" "" "this," "" "said Mr Abdi," "" "is a very thin tightrope walk." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim Obama has founded ISIS was "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J.Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his repeatedly repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously meant.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions on the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings its fellow campaigners who try to protect him during an eventful stage, in the peculiar position to declare statements which he could not have meant at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">After he had made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening Mr. Trump reversed his claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was the opposite to the previous day Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the allegation was completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate wanted to know nothing about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism came down on Mr. Trump, while he tried to draw the focus of his campaign for declining demand values to the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Following Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defence.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he drew a strong criticism when he thought that the Russians were to hack Mrs. Clinton's e-mails, but later he explained, "Of course, I said the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then rowing back as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his ways to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive, and then" clarify "depending on how the reaction fails." said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who observes the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump accepted an even more etcher tone, as his demand values declined further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a lead with a leading edge in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally trying not to excuse oneself for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humor.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is increasingly focusing his attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps jokes his loyal companions in the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent pronouncements, had great difficulty defending the candidate today in a CNN interview of Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "" "Mr Giuliani said he was questioned about Mr Trumps's statement whether Mr Obama and Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama IS an almost unknown, small organization, he called it a hind broker, completely wrong, and that's why it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream republicans attempt to argue that the government under Obama, in which Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to expand by allowing them to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of quarreling on each of his words and being prejudiced against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he ridiculed the" "" "poor, miserable" "" "TV experts who try to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats mocked Mr Trumps's apology as just another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="1">Once driven by the price from the market, café is back in Greenpoint</seg>
<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a cute café in Williamsburg, where you could pay only cash, which didn't have Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices from his Bedford Avenue store were supplanted.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Soap Cherie shop, which replaced Verb in summer 2014, sells the soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Local people saw it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I can still not believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is exempted and Verb is now a soap shop."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is a change, then it is also new invention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revitalized verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the club is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old coffee bar, the owner and managing director of the new coffee bar.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered to provide money for a new exterior, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, retained many things.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment too.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishings like capers and acidic onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural sweeteners.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café serves no more beer, but there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months, Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "many old customers were also displaced by prizes from Williamsburg," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and visited the Verb regularly.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">After the verb had closed, she gave up the coffee drinking, she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "it was clear to me that it was at the coffee and in the culture of the verb that pleased me," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">Now she drinks coffee again, even if on that day she has ordered a Blended Chai tea instead of her usual ced coffee, which is another new addition.</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and loyal customer since the start of the club in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="31">He went there before work and invariably ordered the same.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "I came fourth after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything bagel with butter," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="33">Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nowadays Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.</seg>

<seg id="25">Meat, which was the focal point of American cuisine for many years, became a seldom served luxury.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland shark: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-hair usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">After an investigation this shark was allowed to return to the sea on board the Sanna research ship.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was born in 1624 and floats at a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland shark only get up with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely the Greenland shark swims at the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it comes in average just 1.220 meters far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it matters, the five meter long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle characterized by slowness, however, seems to be a recipe for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the scientific journal "Science" at any rate of a Greenland shark who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "insanity," "" "commented Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock this life-span, which means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The evolutionbiologist presumed for a long time that Greenland shark will become stone-old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was lacking.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's arks are hard to observe, after all they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear in the winter at the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland's hair.</seg>
<seg id="17">They measured their slow motion as they fitted six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">The sharks nevertheless make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice cream and seek cadaver, which torment from higher water layers downwards.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland shark, which caught Fischer from Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the largest shark was 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analysed with the carbon-14 method the lens nucleus of the sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens already arises before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein are not renewed later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly high carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Its birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons search deported large quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third-smallest animal with 220 centimeters length, the lenticular nucleus, on the other hand, contained a low surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons, so its 50th birthday is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">In their lens nucleus all larger Greenland shark, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 quantities produced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493-centimeter-long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimetres might even be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland shark females only get young when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers of the length could classify an old age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age with 156 years was determined, Greenland shark with the increase obviously can be at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates currently.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is no coincidence that such methane minerals live mainly in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland whale, in whose bacon at the neck was a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on fire-flame.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they later ripen - and age slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often very big.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal emits warmth.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as early as possible," "" "explains the Evolutionbiologist Scheuerlein." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal, on the other hand, should invest his resources more in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="3">Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust Documentation "Shoa," left his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four-day pilgrimage to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together, four stages were overcome.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the period up to the next Romance pilgrimage of all the young registrants in two years, the St. Anna senior ministerial round decided to prepare and carry out a long-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations have been examined and finally decided for the Episcopal City of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy on the Freiburg cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis of Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligenzimmern opened their way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening, Parish Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the Pilgrim Cross and distributed the Pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb, by train, we went to the starting point Villingen, where also a Minster of Our Lady stood and so the pilgrim way from the Münster was started.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening, depending on a brief impulse with various prayers, songs and texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, Minis repeatedely made Rast to sing together a song from specially made pilgrims song book.</seg>
<seg id="11">Parishes of the local parish were available for overnight stays.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner last night in the men's team sprint in Velodrom in Rio for fame, when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow assumed the role played by his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy. he was proud of the legend when he stormed home to hit New Zealand's favourites.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago while Hoy scored the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after taking only a modest sixth place in London at the World Championships in London in spite of the squat's back.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did so in good time as a hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Scots that had unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy prevailed - and Skinner placed an olympic chord in the qualification laps, but in the standard round the New Zealanders won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hindes fell short after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner kept it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation, in which Hindes went in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked at his position as BBC expert and dropped Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they rose to the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it's a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an olympic record in the final round and defeated the world champions.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 on the Kenny and Hoys side, Hindu admitted that after a weak start, he deliberately went to the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He withdrew this statement later and there was no objection to British rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such a victory this time there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Hindi said," "" "It feels like the whole GB of flags on the tribune like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team over the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the bicycle rom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the Form Kenny, it is in the realm of possibility that he repeatedly repeats Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would mean for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who also was born on March 23 (a seemingly sacred date for British sport; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">This would be the same from Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny is next in the Sprint, which starts today and will go for more than three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said," "" "I just enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "Hindi said:" "" "if he wins two other gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometer race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They came to the finish in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record that won gold in London 2012 was 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday, he fought with delegates before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition which will be continued and terminated in the morning, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowel Shandong, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie on a world record period in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on his strong team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a crowd of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were downgraded.</seg>
<seg id="46">Dramas played in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and mobbing reproaches as well as retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks as if the now legendary reputation GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium smelting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces of workers - are at stake, as plant operators are announcing the energy supply contract and thereby raising all delivery contracts, such as the supplying energy company announced.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria earlier this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A maximinum payout for 20 years runs in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the installation of Alcoa in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 workstations - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effects as the melt consumes approximately 10 percent of the total power generation of Victoria.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa finished the Point Henry enamel, which resulted in closure of the Anglesea power station last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melt of Alcoa in Portland loses cash and risking a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows years of speculation as to the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and recently due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will terminate their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp keep smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL expects the plant to continue to operate in Portland, which means another physical demand for electricity through the melt," announced the company.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "AGL continues to say that the contracts are so-called" "" "hedging transactions" "" "that should have entered into force in November 2016." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a period of 12 months, so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "from this point, AGL assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue," "" "said the current supplier." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on income to AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the predictions of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL announced that it had already deducted the value of the contracts in its annual depreciation of $187 million in "anticipation of a termination."</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the" "" "Alcoas..." "" "ability to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt" "" "did not interfere." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, who would have entered into force from November this year, even if it is still a matter of explanation why it has withdrawn from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the sector's poor economic situation before the possible closure of the Portland melting plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the analysts' statements at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses around 600 megawatts per year to generate about 900 MW of electricity per year.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan. Kris is on the cover of the sought-after September edition of the US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on her Instagram account.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to cry," Kendall wrote.</seg>
<seg id="5">The cover of the cover was followed by a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians), accompanied reality video that shows the entire Kardashian Jenner family (with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn) as well as in the presence of the universally popular Showbiz uncle and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest).</seg>
<seg id="6">This represents the cliché of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has certainly begun.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's big sister Kim likes her as regards the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were looking to see them in April 2014), but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most sold out of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that rather resembles an illustrated book than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (According fashionista were from the 832 pages of the tome 615 pages advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover star is expected to be so longingly expected that in the last two years pictures of the magazine filtered through before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who have already been on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "in recent years there were clearly more" "" "celebrities" "" "as" "" "models, the celebrities are" "" "on the cover." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar prize-winner and Dior-brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honour.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to celebrities or reality stars or youths of today who know how to make a good Snapchat video (even though everything is true for Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who are involved in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course Jenny's success doesn't suit everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With her reality TV history, Jenners's position in the world of fashion was always somewhat tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June, the former Victoria's Secret-model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized them and called them "the mistletoe of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings looked up again when the message appeared with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue Cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But running around on the mess seems to pass by the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">She runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">She makes advertising for your primer by Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">You and all her sisters are selling pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sells her own pictures of Cindy Crawfords's daughter to the LOVE magazine.</seg>
<seg id="30">And in her spare time she is seen in reality TV. probably just to see her sister Kourtney and her children.</seg>

<seg id="2">The upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (September 4) and Berlin (September 18) have significant losses for the SPD and CDU government parties.</seg>
<seg id="3">This resulted in representative surveys conducted by the INSA public opinion research institute for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).</seg>
<seg id="4">While the red-black government coalition in the north could scarcely manage to govern, this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="5">But in both provinces the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances of continuing to be the head of government.</seg>
<seg id="6">In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, the SPD dropped from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the survey, the party only smiled shortly before the CDU, which could rise to 23 per cent again.</seg>
<seg id="8">The third place is disputed between the left and the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="9">The left would be 19 percent (previously 18.4 per cent), and the AfD would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="10">In spite of slight losses, the Greens hesitated in the Schwerin Landtag despite slight losses of 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent).</seg>
<seg id="11">NPD and FDP would not be represented by 3 per cent in the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the survey, the SPD in Berlin only polled 23 percent (election 2011: 28.3 percent).</seg>
<seg id="13">CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.</seg>
<seg id="14">They are thus still lying behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but before the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).</seg>
<seg id="15">At 14 percent, the AfD would be represented in the Chamber of Representatives for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="16">With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, whereas the pirates would not miss the move in 2011.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heathrow will bring regeneration and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">For me, that was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, as in 2012 in London when we ran a great effort to make sure that all of our nations and regions benefited from the games.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great advantages to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities, we will alone employ 10,000 new teachers, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.</seg>
<seg id="7">As they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of the expansion of Heathrow is too great.</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will dazzle on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">Expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in social growth and to leave a legacy of skills and jobs both to the airport and to the entire UK.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have a great team at Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 - the five year in a row to the world's best airport terminal, to the T2, which was built in the middle of the two most frequented catwalks of the world.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third runway, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="1">Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "Katz and mouse game" regarding ad blocking</seg>
<seg id="2">For companies that earn money with online advertising, one of the software manufacturers attempts to bypass the ad blocking, a "cat and mouse game."</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block signposts on its desktop, Adblock Plus published a blogpost saying that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social network again.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, Facebook shared that its desktop page would change coding for its advertisements to make it more difficult to detect signposts showing how advertising is part of the advertising page.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it had found a new way to bypass the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a blog post, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this sort of Hin-and-forth struggle between the ad-blocking open source community and the bypassing has already been underway since the invention of indicators," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media company has embarked on the fight is a strong indication of how worrying indicators for the industry have become alarming.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to a study published last year by Pagefonand Adobe, around 200 million people worldwide use display loaders; almost four times as much 2013.</seg>
<seg id="9">With 1.03 billion daily users who access Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of the advertising revenues of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="10">The company is targeting ad blockers on desktop PCs because mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook mobile app for the social network and Instagram, distributed a speaker.</seg>
<seg id="11">Advertising on desktop PCs has a sufficiently large proportion of revenues, so Facebook appears to be worth the investment of such a step as worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="12">On Tuesday, Facebook shared that it would update its "Ad Preference tool" to give people more control over their targeted advertising.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably inhabitable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies by NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus by using tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine if Venus could have rebuffed Earth-like conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably referred to more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protected from rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow turn of Venus will expose its daylight side of the sun for almost two months," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus, similar to evolution, which was previously suspected of planet explorers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably habitable, Venus -- over several billion years --was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans were evaporated and their steam was blown away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide returned with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that as we know it today.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers shared the results of their new Venus' climate model 'in the Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="4">A literal bulletin would have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh race day, the first official doping cases have become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter-obstacle runner in Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and the Polish Weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the start of the already critically inspected athletics competitions these messages come to infinity.</seg>
<seg id="7">Last Sunday, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was proven in Chen, which is used as a masked means for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday afternoon, the International Sports Court CAS confirmed its expulsion from the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old clinched the fourth place in the final about 100 m of the butterfly, but only 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen would have participated in the events of more than 50 m of Freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">The International Olympic Committee (IOC) applied for the opening of the B-rehearsal and a hearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "the national association takes the matter" "" "very seriously and demands from Chen full cooperation in the investigations," "" "said Xinhua from a message:" "" "we will work together with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the judgment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history the IOC, but the CAS is responsible for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also during the night of Rio, the news came through the positive test at Danekowa, the 33-year-old went on to the offensive himself.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "said the Bulgarian TV station BNT." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "it is innocent," "" "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," "" "said the athletic woman." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, it is intended to act on the banned substance around the blood doping agent EPO.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekova has been suspended for the time being, according to BNT, the B-rehearsal should also have been positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojko Borissov immediately contacted the athlete with criticism.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "I don't understand why athletes don't draw the right conclusions," "" "he said," "" "Bulgarians are under observation, so many have been excluded." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">For instance, all weight lifters from the chronically doping nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympic champion in the class to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tomasz three days previously positive for the anabolic steroid Nandrolon.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both deny the intake, however, both may not start in the class until 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before the athletes start, especially the case of Danekova is another serious blow for the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The world association IAAF had forbidden the complete Russian team up to an exception owing to systematic doping, and also the nation of Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the previous offences in China were also provided for violent confrontations between athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">So the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang.</seg>
<seg id="28">"sun Yang pinkelt lila."</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "when I see the podium over 200 m of freestyle, I want to hand over," "" "said Lacourt in the French radio." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun was also the focus of a confrontation with Australian Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I have no time and no respect for doping cheaters," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">In 2014, Sun had been positively tested for the Trimetazidine stimulant at the Chinese Championships, but had only a three-month lock.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data lau: so perfide blacker hackers their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeted at targeted companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey by the malware-defense specialists Malwarebytes at 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months became at least once, sometimes multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of the companies were already the target of a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims readily paid the deletion fee required by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators are noticeably specializing in attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential to ransom erransom is significantly higher than in private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently watching a startling fast evolution of the malware," "" "explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most Malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">First of all, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks happened quickly over the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works after a simple pattern: once on a victim's computer, it searches for recently changed files such as Word-, Excel- or database files as well as for archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the receivables of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the final key code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrency Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where the personal photo database is at stake in private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage precipitates when a ransomware strikes.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of affected German companies reported sales losses due to ransomware, 13 percent had to completely interrupt the business operation, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany there were already several hospitals victims of attacks whose patients could be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims:" "" "do not pay, you only support the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay will get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the perpetrators "demand in view of standstill in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know that and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the safety researchers at F-Secure have examined the user interfaces and contact with blackmailers and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims via chat, how they can pay by Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt sample files for free.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private people are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies must partly bargain collectively and pay five-figure sums to get their data back unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively high-risk gains from the ransomware blackmail, the hackers become more and more professional and share the work, "explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider Sophos:" a single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">It is more likely that these are three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malicious software then in the form of a software kit to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The malware-Kits originated by purchasing the malware, consulting and additional tools for a one-time fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "the scope of delivery includes a fitting tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," "" "says Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmailer then searches for more hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you logs in one of the forums underground, buys the set of a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is effected per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually criminals employ spammers with dissemination" "", "explains Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">In the meantime, the risk of ransomware has become known to many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of the companies IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey rely on rewarding ransomware by file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if data encryption alone is not a threat to successful blackout, the perpetrators are threatening to release sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," "" "explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Depending on the type of data, the damage potential is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the future, the perpetrators could also take completely new goals on the internet of things on the grain.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the hacker conference, Defcon, safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the activation of such a blocked heater might well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a subject in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="4">Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear, it does not work tight at all.</seg>
<seg id="6">The interior materials are well-finished and have a pleasant effect, only the cockpit upper side is slightly falling apart.</seg>

<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seats of the back bench can be folded up like a movie seat and offer storage space, which is 1.24 metres high from the floor to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The luggage compartment can be loaded well, but the load height is 650 mm higher than with the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he should do his job a bit quieter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another powertrain: a 1.5 liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.</seg>

<seg id="20">"" "the collision warning sometimes irritates because he assesses many obstacles as" "" "approaching objects" "" "when maneuvering." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">The high-beam assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed controller responds to the recognition of traffic signs and throttles the speed as required.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, full connectivity is only available for top-level equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation system, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and one HDMI jack are located under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The roughly 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who do not want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 20000 Euro, the diesel of 23,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="2">It is regularly stowed on the bypass road - here is an image of November.</seg>
<seg id="3">But this should change: the right balance should be extended.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips for sleeping disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening you roll around eternally, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning it is not possible to think of sleep long before the alarm clock.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequent or permanent as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep problems manifest themselves?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many causes behind them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weak, member of the board of the German Society of Sleep Medicine and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understands for the time being, however, is the insomnia, i.e. an entry and sleeping disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is precisely the sleeping experience that many people perceive as unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German household medical association with practice in Varel in Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind this can be organic, mental or behavioural factors, but also drugs.</seg>
<seg id="12">Sleep disturbance is often an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is common in depression," "" "says Weak." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors are mutually dependent.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, those who have a herniated disc can sleep badly, wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to salute over everyday problems and worries, there are kind of things.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are affected by the day should go to the doctor, advises broke away.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate sleep problems, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or drugs - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases, and no more than two weeks at most.</seg>
<seg id="22">Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medicine centre of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin, is hardly available in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, one should first contact the family doctor in case of sleep problems, advises broke away.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can clarify with studies whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go into the flabor, and what happens there?</seg>
<seg id="26">For example, in the case of snoring with airfuls, for example in case of poor daytime, sleepwalkers or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disturbance, Fietze admits to the examination of the sleep laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "please do not make a nap," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After gluing, you go to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-goggles, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera on the ceiling draws the sleeping end.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can those affected handle the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a few adjusting screws which can be used for better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">There is one thing that counts: regular sleeping and sticking times, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV for falling asleep, avoid alcohol and do not watch out at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is absolutely not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few linden trees, in between still a remnant of cobblestones: the Riga road in Berlin-Friedrichshain looks not like that at first sight, but the police is one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If one walks east from east to west, one passes by playgrounds, a frescoed kindergarten and a bioladen.</seg>
<seg id="3">Someone "ugly!" sprayed on the facade of a grey house.</seg>
<seg id="4">In front of a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, it will be built: a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here by 2017.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "article about this" "" "trendy neighborhood" "", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, is, however, preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rental contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, particularly Berlin's inner senator Henkel has repeatedly declared a tough action by the police against the project, the area referred to as a "No-Go-Zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After clearing the premises on the ground floor, the Kadets smiths, with 300 police officers, on 22 June, the police patrolled up official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, locked sections of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the meantime, the building workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the clearance was illegal, and a day later police and construction workers removed from the jug of sympathisers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon, the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk in front of Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many local residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who raises three children here, is mainly irritated by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the residents of the house projects they share the concern for rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a Kiez, who mostly wanted police protection from vandalizing leftists.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin inner senator and the police force between the occupants and their neighbors, apparently does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain, in the East of Berlin, was actually a traditional working-class neighborhood which even today has a low average in comparison to the rest of the city and has a high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Straße in the vicinity of the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was evacuated under large police orders in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the neighborhood has become a magnet for tourists and electors from all over the world over the past few years: with them residents from the GDR times and former occupants share their neighbourhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also reflected in the rents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: they recognize them at discarded discs or freshly painted façades, which have been kicked with paint bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year as often as the words "Left Autonomous Violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason why not all neighbours view this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as physical assault are, according to statistics, almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the crimes are made of material damage, which tend to hit the newbuildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a tenancy house next to the controversial 94, there can be no question of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As far as violence is concerned, it is important: people in the 94 are their neighbours, they were certainly not.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Riga Castle anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, her road is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is consciously drawn into the Riga road - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">That's why it was so important to her that the residents get their way back: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of the inhabitants such as Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: faceless newbuildings in former buildings, which displace the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are ultimately condominiums that are not interesting for many - here are more people who are not so well searched," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I absolutely cannot approve violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what do you want to do if you never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, also with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For zooming, who like color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who come from should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a tavern area, can complain about noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons presented with first names have asked not to be named with their correct name</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is the new Commissioner for Refugees</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact for integration and organiser.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the administration of Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact person for all actors: refugees, working group refugee aid, administration, authorities and who else is involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine Customer of the working group indicated that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the lifelong Wollchsau, which has above all a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">This meant that some - less ridiculously rather than on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write down the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">Looking for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just an experienced Wollmerchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, Annika Deuschle says.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organisation, work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent position for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine Customer, that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers soon to be placed in Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been for some time to find housing for the connecting refugees that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The local authorities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the administrative office to the municipality and job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">In fact, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It does not function until now, whether it is dependent on private dwellings, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common apartments need to be intimidated as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will soon be installed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Prospect is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent residence there are internships, training centres, school grounds, one-euro jobs and aid activities for refugees and migrants who need to be repaired or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," Regine Customer reports.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the yard or help house masters, do nonprofit work - and that is motivated and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community will result in a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "that is" "" "no employment therapy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not mean only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and Client.</seg>
<seg id="37">People should develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need special offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here too, administration and honorary officials jump here.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcomed and welcomed in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "they need to explain to the refugees that it just takes time and can bridge time wisely, for example with language courses." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever will someday develop the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach, may not work and be useless, he will never integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">However, there are also problems, says customer honestly, "people with whom nothing works." therefore, the work of Deuschle and the customer is always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two after the latest incidents fear radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "Regine's customer clearly states" "" "what some naive might call." "" "a residual risk can and may not exclude them." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "these incidents are also subject to the refugees." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the assassins would call them completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "says Regine Customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the main and honorary officials have to look for activities locally and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that a new impetus could soon come to refugees and migrants to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "" "" "to answer this question clearly, the policy is afraid." ""</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to make them helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "in Urbach, we haven't arrived yet where we want to go," "" "says Annika Deuschle." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine's customer also makes it clear that the judges are already utilised to integrate the existing people in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in need one has to help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
