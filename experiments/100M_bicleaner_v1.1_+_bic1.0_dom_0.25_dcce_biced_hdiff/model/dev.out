Obama receiving Net@@ any@@ ahu
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
at the meeting , however , it should also be about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement of settlements and deplo@@ ys Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal between the two has deterior@@ ated further by the deal adverti@@ sed by Obama .
in March , at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech in front of the US Congress which was partly regarded as an aff@@ ront against Obama .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected it with reference to the upcoming election in Israel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an emergency call Professor he conf@@ essed to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told him with a slightly t@@ itt@@ y voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house .
Lamb was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone .
inside the house the officials found the corp@@ se of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note scri@@ b@@ bed on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ drawing ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff had heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb had made the cat@@ astrop@@ hic emergency call sometime afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : the Lamb took the life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after the shooting in the university , which forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get an idea of what Lamb is motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ sh died , said he has no history of violence or criminal pre@@ history .
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students visited courses from both .
at the same time there were some incl@@ ination to problematic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , praised him , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University to have an absence for health reasons and said he had any health problem .
this year , he only taught two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard for him would not constitute a guarantee for an automatic way to employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the escape from the campus , the police found out Lam@@ bs later when he came back to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi in Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ bre gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his par@@ ental home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ yl Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb started his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city of about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and pedago@@ gy .
he did his doctorate in pedago@@ gy in the spring .
one of Lam@@ bs &apos;s long @-@ standing friends described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and the Lamb was 20 when they met through common friends .
she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar game .
at that time he was the s@@ warm of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls melted away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ er obviously had some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ sh , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail had both appeared on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings its own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked on @-@ line for various companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment co @-@ ordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a dim@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ er Night at night 5 . September saw his guitar and harmon@@ ica playing ended before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no indication that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were cleaning up and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , &quot; said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the Student Committee .
around 900 people attended the Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and attended a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght commemor@@ ative ceremony on Tuesday evening , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the watch station , while the university choir sang &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ sters P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police have now said that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that lamb in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ er claimed as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
To@@ ys R Us plans to hire less labor for the Christmas season

Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins and it comes to my mind that I &apos;m a simulated cock and an arm length away from being on a date with the princess of Wales .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest time @-@ travel film ever filmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back in Time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be on VO@@ D , DVD and selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the conflict spann@@ ing almost five years , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN boss challenges once again all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution .
B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the br@@ ink of meeting the Council of Ministers of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ an called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they have proven in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey values showing that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans attempt to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks in surveys down@@ wards , it has ( yet ) not worked .
ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l .
of course it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of which even won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s stamina and begin to drop their dollars to overthrow it .
here are some current survey data suggest@@ ing that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps popularity characteristics have turned 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two out of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive opinion of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures hold in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of GO@@ P &apos;s GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of ten would say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son manages about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the establishment &apos;s favorite , would be the candidate .
a majority of Repub@@ lic@@ ans do not see Tr@@ um@@ ps Temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of Irish voters ten@@ ding to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right tem@@ per for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number counts in the nation &apos;s first choice state , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans think he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively carry out his ministry , and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament was not thrown into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they set up their scholars , Republi@@ can voters hold plat@@ former for real .
when asked who will most likely win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time four of ten at the end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this time in the last cycle , four of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination compared to only 28 % for the final Candi@@ date Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a variety of GO@@ P voters view Tr@@ um@@ ps Camp@@ aig@@ n as plau@@ sible .
even when the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is still beating almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ Support is distributed over a dozen other candidates .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump re@@ aps the majority support .
he points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their mind .
a new pol@@ l from C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have soli@@ di@@ fied their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nonetheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competi@@ tor at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their mind are twice as often for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rap@@ ist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immigrants from Mexico two months ago , immigration has been the turning point in public discourse in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump &apos;s pi@@ vot@@ al His@@ pan@@ o Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but after the new N@@ BC / Post @-@ survey on Monday six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump on immigration issues .
so long as immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do it too .
the fru@@ stration of the government is climbing to new levels .
Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son now account for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days Survey of ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are angry at Washington too .
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines registers / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three out of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; inter@@ rog@@ ation . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential districts in Germany
here in the Hob@@ bit @-@ weg you find the most expensive urban@@ ization - with a view over the North Sea .
in the street , one square metre of a roof@@ ed house cost 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated in the study - so the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which particular locations one square meter costs the most .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential locations , however , one of the price comes like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Angel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of euros per square meter , noted .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top , exceptionally .
Champions League : Bayern &apos;s dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double door sho@@ oter in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller pa@@ yed the way to the FC Bayern 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze provided a dream start to FC Bayern in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission of Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of coaches P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their first game in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry ( 8@@ 9th ) earned at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth race success in series is supposed to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where guar@@ ola will finally get the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
Müller won his 28th strike in the Champions League for the Bavarian lead , with the help of Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who made a shot of the world champion at the edge of a flan@@ k .
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m promised before the match at the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich held word .
they showed a concentrated and committed introduction without gl@@ it@@ tering .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus has won his most recent six home games in the top class , among them well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund also stum@@ bled over here ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , un@@ defeated in seven European teams with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they were courageous , but often too in@@ ventive in their offensive efforts .
the attacks were often initiated by a game shift on the left @-@ hand side of Douglas Costa , which seldom occurred against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller was more fortunate from the right when his flan@@ k came out of the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion awarded the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski had the best opportunities in half one .
first , when Olympic @-@ stri@@ ker Ide@@ ye Brown hit the Pol@@ es head ball off the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct debit , the go@@ al@@ keeper will par@@ take Roberto with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians moved their usual dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could set needle stit@@ ches .
but Manuel Neu@@ er was at the door of keeper Manuel Neu@@ er .
for instance , when he drew a shot of ide@@ ye across the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
in front of Neu@@ er Guardi@@ ola left a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the center near Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it good .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , was sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after the qualifying session , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sports Director Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to do something else , this is a bad thing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even at the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to the slaugh@@ tered Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59 . ) .
Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made everything clear for 13 minutes , mil@@ led by El@@ f@@ meter .
before the match it had come to Kra@@ v@@ allen in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly m@@ um@@ med Bayern fans in their audience @-@ block apparently provoked the supporters of hosts Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces interven@@ ed and went against the Munich @-@ based tra@@ ilers .
at least one Bayern fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
the good news : if you do not , the risk decreases quickly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several employees of the German Institute for Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison to non @-@ smokers , smokers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely to increase the 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3,@@ 6 @-@ fold higher .
the scientists observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
the main causes of tooth decay are cavi@@ ties and inflammation of the gum , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors .
the link between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore due to frequent inflammation of the g@@ ums in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
people who quit smoking could reduce their risk in a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take more than ten years before the endanger@@ ing came back to the level of non @-@ smokers , explained author Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people must persu@@ ade people to be non @-@ smokers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Head of Study H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the time of life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and according to our findings also leads to good dental health up to old age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 were affected by tooth@@ lessness , the DI@@ f@@ E reported .
earlier studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ scores the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists stum@@ ble on remain@@ ders of the late Anti@@ quity from Cologne on the Rhine .
archaeological finds have been found on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the first time .
in the vicinity of the building site for the new Rhine Boulevard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , says museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine , historians are searching for so @-@ called ground monuments .
for all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always considered as a specialist department for archaeological soil conservation .
in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ards the arch@@ e@@ ologists were now found .
from text documents it has already been known that in the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century had stood a church , explained Trier .
besides the remains of the fortress and the church tower there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves that belonged to the church .
young woman of freight train captured
after a young woman is un@@ happy at the railway station in the Lin@@ ear @-@ Lin@@ dern station , the Federal Police asks the people to help .

she was treated emergency medical and brought to hospital by ambul@@ ance .
on the basis of the noc@@ tur@@ nal crossing of the young woman there are no evidence of the medi@@ ating function@@ aries .
the incident could possibly be seen by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .
local residents or pass@@ ers @-@ by from Lin@@ der@@ ner Bahn , Ziegel@@ bä@@ cks@@ weg , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ straße and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) come into question .
critics concerning the cause of the accident can be given under telephone 0@@ 800 / 6@@ 88@@ 8000 or any other police station under telephone 0@@ 800 / 6@@ 88@@ 8000 or any other police station .
EU Commission adop@@ ts new court in dispute over TT@@ IP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to tigh@@ ten the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TT@@ IP , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system which , in its mode of operation , corresponds to much more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated EU Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de is planning to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position into the US &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; free trade talks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
TT@@ IP aims to create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings see in concrete terms that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries .
a second instance is scheduled for the first time .
it would allow it to obj@@ ections to judgement .
until now , the parties involved agreed with each other on arbit@@ ration judges , there was no possibility of objection to their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past months it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , she wants to work towards an International Investment Court in accordance with his own specifications .
there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be clari@@ fied .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) , especially demanded by major corporations , are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great opposition in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice that companies can use compensation for compensation of tax@@ pa@@ yers , le@@ ver@@ aging national laws , or reducing consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organisations such as Camp@@ act referred to the proposals of the European Commission as insufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was above all critic@@ ised that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
on the other hand , the German Minister for Economic Affairs , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , described the plans as a great advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission included key points in the reform that the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration is from the table .
also the French government welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European business association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against limiting the economic action of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged as a result .
when the talks on the TT@@ IP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday .
negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the US so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should already be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer durable .
delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart which the timi@@ d in@@ timi@@ dated folk singer has recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt @-@ tip pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is nearly seized by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells us about various places he repeatedly draws on the map , about his meti@@ culous and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they came into being and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderful creative innov@@ ator .
with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State , &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs appear that harmon@@ i@@ ously nest@@ le close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can always go into great opul@@ ent drift .
it is rum@@ oured that &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 states would follow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and in the proximity of the Rhine already &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and has a positive effect on certain expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this reduces St@@ ev@@ ens here .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician living in New York returns to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) a comprehensive masterpiece will appear in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bor@@ dering on ideas and styl@@ istic refin@@ ement .
the album entered the Bill@@ board charts and is missing in no one @-@ year list of influential music media .
after very productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic fragments .
this sixth full studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effects and rever@@ b .
from the smaller clubs the stage shows become a colourful spectacle made of ne@@ on head@@ bands and big fluorescent stage design .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five member band .

&quot; &quot; &quot; he presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although nearly 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the distinc@@ tly mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to the in@@ timacy and folk .
without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one hears the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and one can basically throw away the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only after an en@@ core St@@ ev@@ ens would like to thank himself , playing acousti@@ cally a few older songs and finally deca@@ ying with thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gran@@ ce
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gran@@ ce with suspen@@ se is expected
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gran@@ ce and set up for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to make the first of his six pre@@ determined questions shortly after noon , whereby his performance is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour MEPs from near .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour leader to remain silent on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration ceremony for the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence has provoked a criticism of a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the centre of several front @-@ page stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a Mr Cor@@ by@@ n spokes@@ man said he was &quot; respect@@ ful of silence , &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of Shadow ministers have refused to serve the top team in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , and they are called on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party initially supported him as a leader .
the BBC &apos;s political correspon@@ dent Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also pil@@ ing up within Labour , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and limiting profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference said that Labour has made changes to remove all the idea of a bo@@ unds overall .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow working and pensions minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to lower the limit of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he has been a T@@ ory boss over the last decade of the Dis@@ patch box in Parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour leader who promised another politi@@ cian said that he has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Is@@ lington North MP has said that the Prime Minister &apos;s questionnaire is too confron@@ t@@ ational and that he will refrain from both &quot; pun@@ ch@@ ability &quot; and stri@@ fe with bar@@ bs , and instead decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of the economic minister , will represent him if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is on the road abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally spoke the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the lower house , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; j@@ ester &apos;s theater , &quot; which is often linked to the prime minister &apos;s fragment . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television in 1990 , the interviews with the Prime Minister were regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the sub@@ house and its position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far @-@ reaching reforms .

pound St@@ eps through Acc@@ eler@@ ated Ear@@ nings Growth in the UK
the pound went up br@@ ittle according to data which increases the growth in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ B@@ Miller bid goal .
between May and July , the result without bonuses in the UK increased by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
since 2009 , this percentage has been the quick@@ est and most accurate assessment of the timing of an increase in interest rates .
the pound went up by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after the tak@@ eover offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v was received .
a transaction would combine the world &apos;s two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher after encouraging news from the competition Group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures beat all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
Gl@@ en@@ core shares rose 5 % after the mining industry said that he had taken $ 2.5 billion through stock sales as part of his debt reduction strategy .
the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decline of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his estimate for the company R@@ ating on &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % following a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages will end@@ anger expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate the higher labour costs for his company , he says .
the cost could hit the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

the fans do not .
also Bi@@ eber himself does not .
this has already taken care of .
for the advertisement in the advertising break of the super market , he spent three million euros , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ imp@@ le company washed many , many dollars on the Bi@@ eber account .
and with every doll which looks like he and over the counter , Bi@@ eber also collects .

he is said to have exploited more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e is too far .
others stress that Bi@@ eber is in the US and UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; at No. 1 .
Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , is not interested in the many zer@@ os first .
at least he does so .
PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A poster brings Lebanese to a potato @-@ twe@@ eter idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
both - namely in the potato @-@ twe@@ eter developed by the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ owner , Han@@ i Al@@ hay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he accidentally saw on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , a barbecue sk@@ ewer , which is equipped with meat and potatoes , turns in its shop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea was to have the Lebanese registered at the Patent Office in Munich .
according to the authorities , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
therefore , Al@@ hay does not want to betra@@ y how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer has .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding also goes well with its customers .
Met@@ cash starts soil resistance campaign to combat al@@ di@@ - inf@@ estation
Met@@ cash attempts to protect the I@@ GA stores from an Al@@ di advance in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ cash has launched a stance campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailer in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets enhance their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and store shop@@ keepers who sell cheaper tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment will carry out its annual investor strategy day .
there is much on the game as South Australia and Western Australia spend nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in the Eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe Al@@ di will cut away about five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after the opening of its first markets and will take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this pro@@ g@@ nosis is based on the assumption that over the next year , Al@@ di opens 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and the high fixed cost base of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s could cost Met@@ cash around € 13 million before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s revenue in food and food business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ cash will likely disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash declined to respond publicly to comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a member of the Board of Directors of Met@@ cash took contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 , i@@ G@@ AS market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the operational debt reduction while printing revenues and margins .
however , wholes@@ al@@ ers are reluct@@ ant to invest more than $ 150 million in order to increase sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and to improve their stores by improving their stores by rapidly growing fresh foods and delivering a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s chief executive manager Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and shop refurb@@ ishment programs will grow to El@@ an and hopes that in 2017 the wholes@@ aler will again return to profit growth for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism of his behavior .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ z and ear@@ ns praise as a cri@@ tique of his own behaviour , according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented duo , who is always referred to as &quot; Special Cat , &quot; got into the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght by the not@@ orious contest of Cy@@ rene with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , Har@@ rison called out , &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Cy@@ rene , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was finally seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after beating a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ gow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the sing@@ les behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m quite en@@ vious about is the fact that after my opinion , Th@@ an@@ asi was dra@@ fted into the fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost due to a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too severely .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he has never had a problem with the other players , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to consider Cy@@ rene in the important decision that begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; common decision &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed component to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversi@@ es around &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Nick made a very quick rise to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray made out . he &apos;s up in the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions . I think it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares state of emergency , closes the border , holds refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to come illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border when hundreds of migrants arrested in a man &apos;s land and Serbian officials re@@ acted with indignation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck in a strip of land at the street between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations got up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and shou@@ ted insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of them rejected food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary will be sent back , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece will arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ day block at a disputed meeting in Brussels that no common immigration policy could be agreed .
the ministers , however , agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the next month or the end of the year , an agreement would be reached that the EU states would accept another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis on the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary did not put his hopes on a prompt action from Brussels or its neighbours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the emergency situation called on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could block streets and speed up asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having completed a fence on the Serbian border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were deployed to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck for many refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and have become a gateway to the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the upcoming economic refugees are seeking a better life and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make crossing the border or damaging the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 foot ) high fence that the government built along the southern border to Serbia led to a crime . these laws also set higher prison sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the military use of the military , expected next week , but repor@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have seen on the border heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities are quick to repair the fence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungarian officials also closed on Tuesday morning two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , having arrived a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container in order to process people &apos;s data and press a crowd to enter there .
about 20 managed to enter , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders hal@@ ved in national survey
former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to lead a double @-@ digit advance in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face to ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the pre @-@ election ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders stands second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he can vote for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is determined by which candidate they will support them .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their election than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders earned some profits .
Clinton has a great advantage over women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished .
her support with the men has sun@@ k mark@@ edly , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage with democratic voters under 50 years has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Clinton has a big advantage over the older voters .
last month , Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit advance in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the elections say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her .
the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusi@@ astically support them .
while 48 percent of democratic voters are saying that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want it to be the candidate , the most common answer is that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman president becomes president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
from Clin@@ tons Sup@@ por@@ ters their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is also mentioned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consent to dealing with the problems and the eligi@@ bility are also quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the vice president poses a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not .
if democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
more than half of Clinton &apos;s followers say that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to run for the democr@@ ats &apos;s nom@@ ination , H@@ illary Clinton increases his lead in front of S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election , but this number has fallen from 78 percent last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second one in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; selectable &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , with the question of what is more important with a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the elec@@ torate .
similarly as in the last month , not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters of the prim@@ aries stands out as unacceptable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristics of voters in the prim@@ aries of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den consider maj@@ orities as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den performs best with the three candidates in hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have any opinion of it .
democratic voters of the prim@@ aries generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server are still being asked as Foreign Minister during the term , most Demo@@ crat voters of the prim@@ aries are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinion overall .
but it is a different story in the American public overall .
half of Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about a third is satisfied .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on their general opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion had deterior@@ ated .
there are mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six out of ten who say their views of Clinton have become worse .
although Clinton is regarded as honest and trust@@ worthy of the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them among registered voters . only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 62 % of voters do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , 55 per cent of the eligible voters view Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump however get good grades in leadership .
from the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush respond best to hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders as honest , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pre @-@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves to Donald Tr@@ ump close to the nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is close behind Donald Tr@@ ump with the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times survey
in the meantime , half of the voters &quot; support in the new survey is om@@ itted , and others lose a dramatic foot@@ ing .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers nationwide . the support is growing 23 % in the last C@@ BS Survey , conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , advancing 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son dropped from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passes Tr@@ ump among repub@@ li@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ con@@ sin Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen down most , from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
the former Gover@@ nor of Florida , J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are 6 % on the third place .
the margin of error in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest pol@@ l is Plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son is in the poll@@ s - he ends with 19 % support with the re@@ public@@ ans , behind Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the recent ABC News / Washington Post survey also showed Tr@@ ump well ahead of Car@@ son .
looking at a Car@@ son ascending in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon himself , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign gig in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers already a trip to the Mediterranean is enough to find even warm water .
a bath in the North Sea or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea this week , divi@@ des the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) .
on the other hand , bathing temperatures still offer the Mediterranean Sea : in the east , it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic , it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt rises to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood dead@@ ened with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ er
almost two years after a student died during a schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic ritual of a student joint in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges were filed against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ derschaft attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , told the police .
officials said he had been loaded with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g fain@@ ted and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s clothing , goo@@ gle his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to seek advice , police Chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide items and basically ordered the welfare of the Brotherhood via the von Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ gra@@ ef Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning in his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeated with bl@@ unt force injuries to the head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student died at the ch@@ ic@@ anes every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer representing D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for the murder of the third Gra@@ des for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of embarrass@@ ing attacks and the formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we not only want to take responsibility for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that has sanc@@ tioned this , officially or in@@ official , we will also hold this ac@@ coun@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood has re@@ vo@@ iced their affili@@ ation to the local council .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest increase comes , and the house will fall into fuel , yields for bonds will rise and the economy will slide into recession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy offers only little guidance for the process .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments respond .
therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period required for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could find that all the excitement was exagger@@ ated because of the increase in interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no impact .
here , a look at historical trends shows how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market saw last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment occurs , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency that wealth yields will be reduced by 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which might reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what is going on after the F@@ ed &apos;s interest rate increases . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , in the past 35 years , the market is mostly upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average yield in past six cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis that Bob D@@ oll , head of plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , published at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the return thus begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote it .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that could not have existed before and which could accelerate a recession .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point at a rate increase in the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Deutsche Bank , in the case of the 118 interest increases since 1950 , only twice the nominal GDP was below 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few anticipate that this will last and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this time is different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants held the F@@ ed interest rate all year round , and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading has only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all increase cycles from 1950 to now have taken place in a super @-@ cycle with increasing momentum in GDP , and pre @-@ rec@@ essions sh@@ aded very quickly after the beginning of recovery in the shadows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far .
the fixed income was also volati@@ le as the market anticipated interest rate increase and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than with shares if they change their strategic course .
in the case of bonds the returns seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle takes place .
at the end of the increase cycle , the bond yields immediately fall , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the increase in interest rates will result in yields between longer and shorter bonds closer together and leading to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still careful to expect higher returns , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analysts at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is interesting , says Jones , that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest has risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , credit margins have expanded and volati@@ lity has increased - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy .
in large and large companies that handle the greater part of their business activities in the United States , profit rates will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts will get worse , as a rising dollar accounts for their products on the global market and also the financing of their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after initial interest increase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analy@@ st in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded on average by 5 percentage points on average after each of the increases in interest in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital returns and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their equi@@ val@@ ents with lower quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts become a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most , Gold@@ man said .
outside the pure share games consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; savers could see gains due to higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are how fast that will take place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says MP Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the station for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cur@@ v@@ ature &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ish@@ able from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Voice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said that this is not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns &quot; to Classic FM , says a leading member of the Parliament and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private sen@@ ders do not do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham also said the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public broad@@ caster &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distingu@@ ish@@ able from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , appear to be The Br@@ its only under a different name .
so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you can only im@@ itate what &apos;s already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ing@@ ham .
BBC General Director rejected the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I will not learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music making really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and order new works is really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder to work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which , during the hearing in the Committee on the Sel@@ ection of Culture , Media and Sports , came under fire to tramp@@ le the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins took The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George was produced as a judge - &quot; in special BBC @-@ mode . &quot;
he added that he wanted the company to &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; if it launched a series of entertainment next time .
however , he refused to exclude the order from further ranks of The Voice in the future , or to spend money from the commission for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales slow@@ ed down in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest result since the record began in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed the issue in November
for over a decade , the virtual shopping has bo@@ omed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost towns .
but experts say that there are now signs that online sales will stagn@@ ate after new numbers show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index of the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this comm@@ utes itself , and we may experience that growth decreases .
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for decreasing revenues .
experts believe that shop@@ pers with@@ hold their purchases prior to this event , which takes place last Friday in November .
last year five times the average number of buyers gathered around their computers to make their bar@@ gains and some dealer sites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , where the buyers strug@@ gled for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 output was spent at a little more than £ 1 online .
in some products such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now carried out via web @-@ shops .
at the same time more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion labels in the inner cities .
Muslims buried the people killed in Mec@@ ca during the crane accident - bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first burial in Mec@@ ca by the streets .
Saudi Arabia reli@@ eves the collapse of some of the gigantic Saudi Bin Laden groups
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the dead who were killed as a crane in Mec@@ ca &apos;s grandfather collap@@ sed .
mour@@ ners filled , dressed mostly in white , the circuit to pay their respect when the first of the dead came to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the procession passed on to the Holy Place where only days before a building crane collap@@ sed through the mos@@ que &apos;s ceiling and then on the worshi@@ ppers .
the bodies were released for burial when the Saudi king had imposed a san@@ ction on the Bin Laden &apos;s construction company because of the disaster that left 3@@ 94 injured .
the bodies of 29 people who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed through the Great Central mos@@ que of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets .
among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram came from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who were on his first pilgrimage to support the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the yearly H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden group should not have let the arm of the crane stand when it was not used .
an Arab version of the decree published by the state Saudi Press Agency said the bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the leadership of the company abroad was forbidden .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the down@@ fall of the Cran@@ e , which rush@@ ed into a courtyard of the great mos@@ que , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before the p@@ addle , which takes place later this month .
the Bin Laden Group has not issued statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for comment .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also rebu@@ ked the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surrounded Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mos@@ que as part of the massive building project headed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major construction projects .
the de@@ ceased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the collapse of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said that 15@@ 8 people stay in hospital .
government officials said that 1 million ri@@ als ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) are to be paid to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other injured are given half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Bos@@ s says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
British increasingly occupy arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increased
this will lead to the opening of 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops target@@ ing tra@@ des@@ people
at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher will close 60 B &amp; Q outlets throughout the country
from Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that the British lay down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified eastern European craftsmen who carry out their work in their homes
if you can handle a hammer or a brush for painting walls , you seem to belong to a minority today .
the British are increasingly occupied with arti@@ sans to carry out DIY jobs in their houses , the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , the new managing director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the hardware chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe , offering services at low prices , is now obsol@@ ete .
as a result , King@@ f@@ isher is planning to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at tra@@ des@@ people and close 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten buying decisions were hit by women .
at the moment , the men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that show more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is still a majority of men working in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this to a balance more strongly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a UK listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is the only company that has exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management board and Chief Financial Officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales , after the Group deb@@ ated the costs of closing the stores .
due to the trends , King@@ f@@ isher , who has Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity to court
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball runner A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and public spending .
the defend@@ ants ple@@ aded not guilty .
one of them had also been accused of office abuse .
he was acqu@@ itted by this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process was postpon@@ ed .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the preliminary investigation cryst@@ alli@@ zed that the defend@@ ants used funds from association accounts in the years 2006 to 2011 , which they were allowed to disp@@ ose of in their functions for private purposes .
it claims the damage with around 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sports officials are also charged for financial off@@ ences .
this fact expi@@ red the chair of the Sho@@ v@@ eller Senate , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
for the dis@@ fi@@ del@@ ity of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence asser@@ ted that no asset had occurred at any time .
the sports officials had just calculated expense allowance and the sports club for whom they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and where they had invested a lot of time and money from the debt - the liabilities in 2001 amounted to some 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time we were faced with the situation : do we continue or block the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the defend@@ ants told , in the B@@ read @-@ based firm of the financial ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he then decided to take over this task with his colleague and co @-@ defend@@ ant .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , laid down our life insurance policies as security at the bench , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during acceptance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can freely admini@@ ster the money , it is not allowed to make any debts .
furthermore , in case of a corresponding financial success , the reimbur@@ sement of expenses for the expenses to be reimbur@@ sed retro@@ spec@@ tively until 1991 was decided .
therefore , one part of the allowance was paid only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus was on the account .
so also package deals and not detail@@ led entries appeared , the former ob@@ man explained the events .
the accounts and as@@ par@@ ag@@ us books shared the two defend@@ ants , &quot; said the second accused .
the judge asked why the withdrawal had not been disclosed in detail to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association did not care in detail for the financial support , it was important only the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when in 2011 , against the one function@@ ary investig@@ ator on the matter of mis@@ use , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the club account .
those were appropri@@ ations , the defend@@ ants declared .
this securities account ran on the name of the second defend@@ ant and , according to the statement , was not known to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a long time , the respon@@ dent did not know an answer .
then he finally said that he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything of this money , the prosec@@ utor put in the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claims compensation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why in@@ dem@@ nity ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
wher@@ eu@@ pon the first defend@@ ant declared that he had not agreed with this formulation because the association had never been damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With this you are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a lawyer ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore the function@@ ary said he never paid a cent salary , he only calcul@@ ates mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
he added 1,000 euros to the association to di@@ ets per month , but the actual expenditure was much higher , he added .
exact documents for the early years could not show the accused .
these were no longer stored after an audit in which everything was judged as correct .
o@@ dom@@ eter also referred to the second accused .
all the arrangements were made in cash , so he had to go to the bank to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence to the bank , he explained in his statement .
the main hearing is continued on 23 September with the questioning of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard st@@ inks another 30,000 jobs
in addition to staff cuts that have been ongoing for three years , the computer can disman@@ tle further jobs when spl@@ itting up the company .
the star@@ ches at the US @-@ Compu@@ terri@@ fic Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) have no end .
as part of its restructuring , the U.S. technology group plans to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30.000 jobs in its corporate customer division .
this meant that costs amoun@@ ting to EUR 2.7 billion ( EUR 2.4 billion ) were to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the move will result in a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed .
at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 associates .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard &apos;s share yiel@@ ded 2.3 percent over the exchange .
the group grown with printers from California &apos;s Pal@@ o Alto is currently being split up : the computer and printer business will be bund@@ led together this year in a new company , separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data store for companies and other services .
both business sectors are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC he@@ el as well as a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services set the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo last .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
the proceeds went back in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP rep@@ lies with spl@@ itting and massive positions on changes in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only late re@@ acted that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and getting more and more stores on @-@ line .
in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age the reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflicts : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
however , a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would mainly rep@@ u@@ di@@ ate : 54 per cent said , by contrast , 35 percent were appro@@ ving .
the fact that other countries fly air strikes against IS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive .
in contrast , 24 per cent are likely to intervene in the conflict .
a collaboration with the Syrian authorities , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , rejected 51 percent of those surv@@ eyed , 20 percent would be responsible for this .
29 per cent could not decide .
car : second day of the press at the 6@@ 6th IAA
the focus of the fair will be on the 27th of September connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and electro@@ mobility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mobility connects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; officially on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the general public can visit the IAA from Saturday .
like two years ago , the organizers of the V@@ DA car association will count around 900 000 visitors .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence broke out on the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police used several hundred refugees on the Serbian border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and the water@@ shed .
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the violence in the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it a police line had formed and behind the police officers stood a water@@ shed .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially stopped pe@@ pper@@ mint .
the police then used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
in this way the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now withdrawn something . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees put together in themselves and suffered under breath .
the press spokes@@ persons of the Serbian police also suffered injuries through the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US staff
the world is watching when the U.S. staff arrives at two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the most important decision whether interest has been raised for the first time for almost a decade or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , which was last week of view that the F@@ ed would do so , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates at the current level will last from 0 to 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historic event because it has been seven years since F@@ ed has put interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Managing Director at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of power , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ru@@ sty outlook for global conditions .
it warned the markets to adapt to an increase , but the signs suggest that the chances for such a move are good .
the decision is to be announced at 8 : 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death wag@@ ons at Delta State University left behind exc@@ uses
after the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues on the day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted to &quot; make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor of ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 am Monday morning
and he said , He shot on a man , and killed a man .
lamb said to the staff of the emergency call centre that the police must send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give it .
Lamb did not give any explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note of Lamb , 45 , who said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could reverse it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when police officers surrounded him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday that Lamb had believed that Pr@@ enti@@ er had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was created by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that she was married for about seven years , as a &quot; good person . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ er had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ er were her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was working online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ sh , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that Lamb had called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s not going to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen pick him up on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later that night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to the forest , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb received a doctoral title from the Delta State University in the spring of 2015 , as his life lau can be found on the university &apos;s website .
stars that have lost their lucky charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years .
in 2001 , he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer .
the actor allegedly had to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession .
all this certainly calls for its tribute .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa is expanding the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large corporate restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organisation .
150 of the approximately 1000 executives around the world will cost the company restructuring at the workplace .
however , with the pilot trade union there are new negotiations .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the low @-@ cost Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is a contribution to earnings of around € 500 million a year from cost and income syner@@ gies , divided the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa is no longer a member of the Board of Management for the passenger business .
the cheap airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
in the future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the Management Board of Managing Director Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
to date , the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex .
the airlines operate under the roof of the Pass@@ airline group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of EUR 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots
the negotiations after the strike @-@ stopped strike on this Thursday should be resum@@ ed in the conflict with the cockpit agreement Cockpit ( VC ) .
this shared the union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the theme of the talks is to be the retirement provision for pilots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in one year , the cockpit wants to come to yiel@@ ding results as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and the airline led to various strikes in recent months .
in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the wings are the &quot; Wings &quot; savings concept .
it stipul@@ ates that Lufthansa moves to the Group &apos;s own cheap @-@ line Eu@@ row@@ ings in the fight against competitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; under the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ ning in the South &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; there are paintings by Le@@ ena Krü@@ ger at Künst@@ l@@ erhaus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Finn@@ in , based in Göttingen for a long time , has compiled a selection of tit@@ ular works for the White Hall of the House , which anim@@ ate their viewers to embar@@ k on a journey .
Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United cannot play for months because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered from Manchester &apos;s Champions League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven a double frac@@ ture of his right leg .
while this has brought the left def@@ ensi@@ sts to weeping and closing him for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ruth@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w entered the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being brought to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg structure and is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps one day later and operated on in Manchester .
it &apos;s horrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , it &apos;s very hard and then plays fantastic , and then that happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture then it takes six months and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno appeared to be happy to escape a red card and the suspension of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , did not punish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbit@@ er was wrong .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an el@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a tweet to Sha@@ w &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery is right now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
referring to : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the PS@@ V defeat
with the European Championship in France , the UK Defender has an additional incentive to recover until the end of June .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a player with this kind of injury leaves the place , all are very sad about it .
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno had a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s very hard because it wasn &apos;t his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ c@@ u said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very bad at that . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ der by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron is familiar with The Lor@@ ax ?
it is one thing that all parents soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t be long before you know it almost by heart .
unless you &apos;re David Cameron .
when he was asked by a supplier of child@@ care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the en@@ vi@@ ro@@ ment published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on Super@@ Camp@@ s website , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children , because it always seems to give a picture or message we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and well , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the story of the book , instead re@@ prints a summary of the 2012 movie release that added new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; amid the walled city of Th@@ rill @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , by listening . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and who died 1991 , however completely unknown .
as if that were not yet suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly read like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ rill @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he agrees to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so un@@ familiar with the story of the book . here , an un@@ named boy hears , like the local environment , rav@@ aged by the gre@@ edy , trees f@@ ading , thri@@ ll kn@@ itting Once @-@ ler , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , sle@@ az@@ y being that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row a child .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text was probably from Camer@@ ons &apos;s electoral cycle .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but gave no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult
encounter@@ ing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when one sees the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , there is no repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat on my card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would not exclude a down@@ turn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site might be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the batch setting , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he is an unknown quantity at test level , is an option for the attack .
this message : Adam Ly@@ th dies from the England test cabin and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th , of course , is difficult for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are oriented to results .
there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this - players are their own best selection .
long ago , one would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate .
if he hopefully turns out further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes .
the England @-@ coach Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he did not perform so good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to put his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first sat down in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in maximum form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales is coming in , and he is a drummer , whom I highly recommend .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he achieved 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge square , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same odds as those before him , but this depends , of course , on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of suggest@@ ing mos@@ ques beside Cook , which would provide an extra spin bowl and receive four qui@@ cks , emerged , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ ques may not have done his job for his county of Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he joined the Open@@ er in 2001 .
he has made three hundred runs straight away and didn &apos;t look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ re as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling of him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see their statistics - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
aside from the team , England has done a few clever additions to the coaching staff .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ din , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a masterpiece .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences as he played in all the conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices in the changing cabin can bring fresh wind , even if the messages are in line with what was said before .
Coll@@ i &apos;s te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not taken lightly .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit of Great Britain from the EU ) could gain access to Zul@@ auf if the economy enters a sl@@ um by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ signed ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get into trouble with each day , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n becomes the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which viol@@ ently crushed Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at said recently that some member states are so deeply involved in various crises , as the EU is now and not always on its own fault , Britain &apos;s self @-@ created agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive contract changes that they mostly do not want to be satisfied .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it would not like it if it end@@ angers the social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s all about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , who wishes a UK looking outside in the EU tent - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as with the exagger@@ ated lengthy ten@@ ure like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande look back on his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
it is also a da@@ zz@@ ling power .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right @-@ wing government , Spain a left .
it is hard to imagine that they will break a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
that &apos;s why some such ministers may even deliberately not plan helpful ann@@ ot@@ ations , all in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process susp@@ ects my boy@@ friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing of the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press zone as they were not supported during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opport@@ uni@@ sts who have made a name for themselves as an &quot; EU @-@ Stra@@ i@@ ght ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s .
with all its ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
to this end , the Med@@ ley of Tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , phone @-@ h@@ acking ali@@ ens and the pseu@@ do @-@ non @-@ foreigners that most of our big newspapers possess .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but found that when you sit in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , you &apos;d better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of going to his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had put the principle on the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor to him .
the press has never denied it .
but the cute Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly tap on the back on Monday - I told him that he had no time to waste me for me - seems to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 &apos;s , a mistake at that time and today .
it may take but he has to develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but surely with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe is - I express it friendly - in development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ dy@@ e trend and the wild sign of Tor@@ ey Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can say yes to everyone .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week said that the sc@@ out had fought in him , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the pro@@ voc@@ ative John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
the struggle of Hil@@ ar@@ ys was even more attractive .
but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and dep@@ u@@ ties after all reports at their convention on Monday evening .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - keep in mind that he even stir@@ red me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it &apos;s right not to give Cameron any free ticket for Europe , which allows him to keep Lab@@ ours &apos;s support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks for sure .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities to EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite claim economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try , in all , to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin fail to waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be sen@@ sel@@ ess ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military service in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded at the start on Monday of something called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critici@@ ze report from Public Health UK via e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims from a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , some with connections to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) have joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
he published the &quot; principle report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinarily win@@ dy basis &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two further researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that the claim of P@@ he that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were called to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( MC@@ DA ) in order to lead their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also wrote BA@@ T references to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting announced to receive funding from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he received after reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International added .
the reasons for selecting the members of the committee will not be delivered , but this includes several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also include a sector finance in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the session also took part in the P@@ he tobacco management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ is@@ cated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products with most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or limitations will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been used as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prof. Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well @-@ Being at P@@ he said that the alleg@@ ations of BM@@ J have already been re@@ acted before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies at his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence shows and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative risks compared to tobacco .
nearly 80@@ ,000 people annually die of a disease related to smoking , and smoking will cost the National Health System two billion pounds a year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the clear presentation of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC should give up an East@@ ender , says former Head of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ ender and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give &quot; their right arm &quot; for hit shows such as the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he critici@@ zed the BBC that they are public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and of broad@@ cast@@ ers such as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC general director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to contact the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 without any success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes are commissioned or broad@@ cast@@ ed , which would also be clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee as part of his investigation on BBC &apos;s future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , what I don &apos;t think for a good idea in the medium or long term , one should at least focus on its production on programs that others do not do or commissioned .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve the greatest possible support for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , of course it &apos;s non@@ sense .
Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax financing programs that could also be funded without subsidies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ ender is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm .
I have to see how this should be public television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people working there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular programmes give what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , proposed in his Mac@@ tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows how to sell shows such as East@@ ender .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programmes should go to BB@@ C4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they can argue if they go on their apparent missions to justify £ 4 billion , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
Johnson said to the committee on the broadcast fee : &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions that can get the best value from this .
of course all of us think we all think that for 150 £ a year there is a great value here , but for people who are for the £ 150 a lot of money , ask me if that is true because they do not consume much from the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check its ethics mission &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to inform , train and maintain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said little of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example of the public television stations in Australia and Canada , for example , to &quot; inform , educ@@ ate , and enter@@ tain . &quot;
to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas like that of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and deal with commercial channels alli@@ ances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment they are be@@ amed with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems which can be controlled from qu@@ arri@@ es of sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment when they are be@@ amed with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work through the switching on of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves .
next on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetic , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
th@@ read@@ worms generally do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons wear TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applying ultrasound to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ ves@@ icles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the method has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetic , a ground @-@ breaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetic could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that needs to be sent down to the desired position in the brain on an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent into the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin producing cells , he added .

am@@ nesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works non @-@ profit with the graphic artist and vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over artist who works for free too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP Creative Director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around advertising for the Ce@@ L - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic shad@@ y company advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the blu@@ ep@@ r@@ ints with bright colors and animation it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us to raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture instruments at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we need now is a step in the British government and the guarantee that torture instruments will not be tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally outside our front door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the most creative art around the ce@@ ase@@ fire comes from the area within the scope of Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors sm@@ arten up fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in student resi@@ dences
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ for@@ getting 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved into a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I have anger@@ ed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entry into student residence ranges from slightly nerve @-@ wra@@ cking to absolutely frigh@@ tening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to che@@ at : people tell where you get , whether and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ ana , where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly said Mar@@ m@@ ite will neither love nor hate because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your lashes were burning and those fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people go .
people often turn into drinks reception , film night venues and local meeting points , but they are also places where people dress up and dress up their under@@ wear .
referring to this : don &apos;t remember to start with a relationship at university
intro@@ vert will receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many residence halls form a space @-@ to @-@ space bum@@ ble@@ bee culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted by soci@@ alizing - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
speaking of kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close friendship through baking .
since you start the university at the height of the back man@@ ia , the kno@@ ck at the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have you baked something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain themselves and at the end perhaps you may associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent bear .
poorly mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat make people sleeping when kno@@ cking .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea as well ?
check this with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to use themselves , even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal more balanced as my room@@ mate who added a pur@@ ge to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
it is not only about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people sitting in the glass house in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb .
a girl on my floor asked her neighbors if it was a matter of asking them how to qui@@ eter the drum and bass , because it was three in the morning and it had a test in the morning .
they responded to this with even more loud music .
when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbours to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut her door and went to her three @-@ hour test .
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would accidentally move into the same residence ?
conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be very embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , take care of her , dis@@ connect and then see her every day and maybe witness how she treats all common friends to him ?
of course , the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your abdom@@ en a little reason .
at the exciting moment when you notice that someone has his keys lying in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an ul@@ cer and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good punch is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but never ch@@ ew someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and place your keys in a glass of water , which you put in the freezer - but t@@ ack your possessions on the ceiling not more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single @-@ educ@@ ators , low @-@ income ear@@ ners
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ bert builds row houses for people in Central Fran@@ con@@ ia , who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living room , but also the single mother and the low @-@ ear@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show you how you can build well today and well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are rush@@ ing to the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ bert believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds terra@@ ced houses for refugees in a project .
Mr Gil@@ bert , many refugees will press on the housing market .
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ bert : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people remain in a large part here .
in view of the influ@@ x of refugees , we need enough living space in the next few decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ bert : a row house needs least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if you put people in blocks of flats .
each of the six houses that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace again , I go back .
then the houses can easily be changed according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
Gil@@ bert : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 euros , without land .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction lasted six months .
this is appropriate .
do the building regulations have complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ bert : I went through my project correctly .
especially complicated is the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the regulation Ord@@ in@@ ance .
gr@@ ung@@ y .
it is still under@@ stated , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities there is no place for this .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced project ?
Gil@@ bert : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
what is definitely not true .
but do not tigh@@ ten the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ bert : true , we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but we have built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need housing .
not only refugees , but also the single mother or the low @-@ ear@@ ner .
I &apos;ll show you how you can build still cheap and well today .
that is why it is all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone Operating System when Apple Update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setup app , typing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after installation , as they get an error message telling us that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to circum@@ vent the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the dele@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able by stream@@ lining the update . similarly , it will be easier to do so if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worth making sure your cell phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone may be switched off half@@ way and this could lead to a demo@@ lition of the update .

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows in the fight for the championship title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton only a motto : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup second pointed out before the start into the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the world champion from the second race in Singapore on this Sunday from defending champion and two @-@ way champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on won seven of the twelve races so far and also took the floo@@ d@@ light grand @-@ pri@@ x in the city state as a favorite .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was founded three months ago , has added another member in its ranks so the membership number increased to 19 players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the bearer of the Federal Cross of Mer@@ it 1st class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation made by the chairman Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot afford to pay the membership fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent @-@ seeking should also be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that the membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; as an expression of his connection with the spa town is seen .
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro seeks direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the old centre Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined together under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new point of contact at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg square .
besides consultations you can also take part in courses .
the social foundation dra@@ gs it down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , immediately next to the purchase market , sen@@ iors and counsel@@ ing information will immediately receive information on questions such as care insurance or health care insurance services .
for years , with our ambul@@ ant care service , we have been establishing that many care @-@ loving relatives are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , many cash benefits are not seldom used because the complexity of insurance companies is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new managing director Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ ist and the citizen hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this purpose the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
it is therefore possible to use additional offers such as tor@@ sion prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other perfectly .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; explained Heike R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
both business leaders are seeing the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre especially in the demographic transition .
this is because this makes a good decentr@@ alised infrastructure indispensable in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
moreover , as mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates himself to the association agreement at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ able gathering . &quot;
this makes the social foundation a great contribution for sen@@ iors to live independently and well in their familiar environment .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m .

the meeting of the FC Ein@@ tra@@ cht Bam@@ berg in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Bavarian soccer tot@@ op@@ ok@@ as against the third party FC Würzburg Ki@@ cker was finally terminated .
it will be played on Tuesday , October 6 at 19 : 00 in the Bam@@ berg Fu@@ ch@@ spark@@ sta@@ dion .
&quot; we are glad that we now know when the game goes on stage , we have planning reliability , &quot; says F@@ CE Team Manager Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z Hü@@ mmer , who also points out on the now started advance ticket sales .
it is something special for our team to play against a third party .
we therefore hope for numerous spectators , and this is not without reason , because floo@@ d@@ light plays have a special appeal .
in the round of the last 16 teams , the FC Ein@@ tra@@ cht Bam@@ berg went through victories at the district li@@ gi@@ sts 1 FC Ober@@ ha@@ id ( 3 : 1 ) and at home against the regional gi@@ sts 1 FC Schw@@ einf@@ urt 05 ( 3 : 2 ) .

Viennese architect Karl M@@ ang 92 @-@ year passed away
Karl M@@ ang , one of the do@@ yen of Vienna &apos;s architecture , is dead .
he died on 5 September at the age of 92 , as the Künst@@ l@@ erhaus told on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with M@@ ang the Künst@@ l@@ erhaus left an honorary member and at the same time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as was said in the broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
born 1922 in Vienna , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna at Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War .
he has worked as a freelance architect since 1952 , but he also worked as a teacher , writer and institute manager .
from 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute for For@@ estry .
in the 1980s , he was commissioned to set up the treas@@ ury chamber in the Wiener Hof@@ burg and the renovation of the Palais Lob@@ ko@@ witz in the Austrian theatre museum .
death penalty : Tim Wiese th@@ rows a polic@@ ew@@ oman with money
former soccer player Tim Wiese has been dis@@ cour@@ aged in Bremen .
foot@@ ball@@ ers once , Tim Wiese , former Nation@@ alt@@ or@@ hü@@ ter in Germany and Bremen and H@@ offen@@ heim were engaged , W@@ rest@@ ler .
according to his own statement , he wants 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years .
intellectu@@ ally , on the other hand , he has not admitted .
Wiese has just cut off his hair in the Bremen downtown when he saw a parking atten@@ dant posted a ticket for his white Chev@@ ro@@ let Cam@@ aro .
Wiese rush@@ ed out of the business , insul@@ ting the offici@@ ant , and accused her of the accidental fin@@ es of the feet as reported by the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper .
at the city of Bremen we confirm the accus@@ ations , but it is not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the matter is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says von der Stadt Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only after that decides whether a meadow will be displayed or not .

men beating up on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses seek the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , around 23.@@ 45 o &apos;clock , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one from the group , a 17 @-@ year old Afgh@@ an , followed after data from the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was located at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
on the premises of the gas station there were also three persons .
one of these men now scre@@ amed the young boy and hit his face with his fist .
the victim suffered a nose of no@@ stri@@ ls and ble@@ ed heavily from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he left his victim .
the injured young man was brought home from his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator watched the group with a passenger car up to their apartment and ro@@ de several times there demonstr@@ atively .
when you couldn &apos;t see the vehicle any more , the injured went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was again attacked by the ra@@ cket and another male .
with the help of a stock@@ pile , one checked on the face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim .
the injured person had to be hospit@@ alized for medical treatment .
so far only a vag@@ ue perpetr@@ ator description is available .
one of the men was about 1.80 meter in size .
the second ra@@ cket was about 1.@@ 65 feet tall and was dressed with jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police ask witnesses and instructions to report under the telephone number 0@@ 6@@ 18@@ 1 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank Müller takes over field breaks practice and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) assume the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ est@@ ausen .
there are also Deputy Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ ul .
there is a lack of doctors in many places in the country - A@@ sen@@ dorf on the other hand is lucky : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice in the field on October 1st .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich succ@@ eeds in half a position for his successor in the coming months .
after a reconstruction phase Müller re@@ opened its practice on 12 October , until then it inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight , when Frank Müller and his wife , Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , met Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who is currently completing her specialist training in the Ver@@ den Hospital and also wants to enter into practice this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mil@@ ler would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far I just called her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Müller couple liked the idea to operate their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we want to meet and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees his own boss as soon as possible .
and so it was agreed that the mil@@ ler bought the house with the practice .
however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time father Frank Müller grew up there , his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed chief emergency doctor in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is engaged in the DR@@ K readiness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from September 19 , the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
while the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ est@@ ausen is working as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ acional ) has specialized in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the land@@ owners , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as domestic doctors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the renovation , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and load EC@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
the mil@@ ler receives a total of 50,000 euros in the framework of a funding programme of the administrative district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and glad we are , that the practice will continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sam@@ t@@ eller mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , some 2,000 patients come to the field of field breaks every quarter , in the North German average practice there are about 500 patients .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another doctor &apos;s office .
a positive side effect of the practical tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf , according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ est@@ ausen .
if no successor would have found , it would have gone too .
who visits mil@@ ler &apos;s consultation hour , inci@@ dentally , still looks at familiar faces : takes over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power of the fel@@ lows .
with their departure in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all the doctors have practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ur@@ sel Fel@@ est@@ ausen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she felt a little melanch@@ oly after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients very often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Intern@@ ship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now I have always pressed gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we let the refugees go through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also ramp@@ ed up at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border are maintained parallel to this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still clear that anyone who wants to make a asylum application can do this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of people are in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear , however , that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to continue to travel to Austria and Germany and to establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
however , this Minister of the Interior , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , did not see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area .
as Minister @-@ Minister emphas@@ ised , Sloven@@ ians want to violate its borders for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fill in his obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees in the night hours had already tried to travel by the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in eastern Croatia to avoid registration .
the Croatian police could pick them up in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , police vehicles with new refugees have been constantly meeting in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mainly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , among them numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are also in use .
in the coming days his country will be counting some 4,000 refugees , &quot; said the Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian Serbian border , who had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , would re@@ direct Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Belgrade Government , however , denied that it was to instruc@@ t people to adopt certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , in the morning , a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were on the road all night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border that was about 500 kilometers away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
as a result , the postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary , which has already been predicted by observers , could actually come to a somewhat further west stretch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive border control capabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we carry out strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have since carried out a good testimony to the country , concerning the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side there are still about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to the media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked .
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
Ser@@ b Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to soo@@ the Wednesday morning with a local ey@@ epi@@ ece in Hor@@ gos : he kept the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not be a very high number of refugees currently . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could not yet say whether they would continue their journey across Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , private Hungarian refugee aid workers have already started distributing maps on which alternative routes are drawn in Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .
stock exchanges : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok should have belonged to a ring of cy@@ ber criminal who has been accused of providing insight into un@@ published financial statements and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ ers and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the captured information , insi@@ der businesses should have been made on the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched to the investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the SE@@ C report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 additional accused in the case continued .
most of the defend@@ ants are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators are said to have acted in both the US and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
there is a lively operation around the Par@@ ade@@ platz in Mannheim .
the people do their worries , partly fast steps , partly comfortable bum@@ bling .
you control the two stations of the Mannheim car terminal at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep urban trains .
puls@@ ating , pr@@ es life with wonderful autumn sunshine and in the middle four big plates each with the heading &quot; Before I die I want .... &quot;
with this action , the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce helped to draw attention to its 20th anniversary and is confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among men , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Aid is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and discussions as the voluntary workers .
while a p@@ asser @-@ by spontaneously goes to the chal@@ k and reads the sentence about &quot; My life , &quot; &quot; stop the war , &quot; &quot; stop the war , &quot; or &quot; don &apos;t suffer long , &quot; others are short , read , say sentences like &quot; I &apos;m not yet , &quot; and then go on .
there are always little discussions about the action in themselves , about life , dealing with dying again and again .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; only when I realize that at some point the end of this world comes to me , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the de@@ ac@@ onal work Mannheim , which is jointly with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband wear@@ er of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce .
therefore , this public action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the fact that not everyone wants to communicate on the boards is understandable , but finally it is a very personal thing .
the subject of death and death is still afflicted with tab@@ oos , the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed much to the opening up of people .
an estim@@ ation that An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid shares .
the funeral and mourning companion belongs to the volunteer staff of the first hour .
confronted with the topic of personal experience , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in the eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid appe@@ aled to volunteers by calling , she immediately reported and had been there during the founding in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the hos@@ pi@@ ce Sankt Vincent .
they are all meti@@ cul@@ ously trained .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid is able to deal with her task and experiences and experiences .

F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial outlook for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reported dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the Gi@@ ant Gi@@ ant lowered his prospects for a whole year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire some 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell over 2.5 percent in pre @-@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. Sa@@ ys to Ear@@ n a Profit Bet@@ ween $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the Financial Year , which ends next May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast .
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower view comes despite the increases in price , which is an average of 4.@@ 9 percent and will take effect on January 4th and despite higher rainf@@ all deliveries for heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result will increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and growth in online trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yields solid earnings if one considers weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , who plans to hire 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , for example the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex was earning 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just below $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which predicted twelve analysts from Z@@ acks Investment Research .
sales increased by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six analysts questioned forec@@ asted $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a decline in international pri@@ ori@@ tis@@ ation shipping , which brought sales in its unit express delivery to stagn@@ ant .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales increased by 29 percent while transporting the body , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self insurance .
the express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result decreased because of higher labor costs in the freight business .
in the after@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , F@@ ed@@ Ex stocks fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .
on Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
at their most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time to lift the body for the first time for almost a decade .
there is a mur@@ al of the United States lo@@ oming over them at the end of the orn@@ ate , two @-@ storey seating sa@@ al .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double order from Congress : maxim@@ ising US occupation and prices stable here .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision too tight to predict them . it is announced on Thursday that the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented stimulus through the close @-@ to @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the economy &apos;s data show that it grows solid , recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets could frigh@@ ten the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to increase this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal loans - and be it only about a quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation in the first place will be the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which insur@@ es itself to the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists who have recently been inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase in interest this week .
the financial markets , however , expect to wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance to increase .
this suggests a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed raises the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts allevi@@ ate the blow by promising that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial average j@@ umped by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the movement this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that they won &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that interest rate increase would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed on a good way to increase the rate by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow intensi@@ fication of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that in this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the sentence ensu@@ ed .
although job creation slow@@ ed in August , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world met at the end of last month after China had depreci@@ ated its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value dropped by more than 16 % in May when investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would cur@@ b global growth .
this month the market recovered a little while the Dow is now nearly 10 % below the pole of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation when interest is to be increased .
&quot; if events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the past few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US staff .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get better grip on the effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the effects on the U.S. economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be involved in decision @-@ making technically .
but in the end the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the mere indication of the former director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; close &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their monetary expansion , dis@@ b@@ anded confusion around the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can expect that they not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global asset management strategy of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that are apparently not linked to the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ ner , member of the Federal Open Market Committee , ple@@ ading for an increase in interest , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia helped the F@@ ed to reduce its interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in spite of limited det@@ ectable effects on the growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lack@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later , the F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability to the first place only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market place , &quot; said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest rate .
the recent tur@@ mo@@ il does not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest because the markets are upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until it is changed I don &apos;t think it should be ahead of time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little Life Aid for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
to give you a warm welcome does not go without the commitment of countless volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
they include Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still likes to teach with her 74 sequences .
every Thursday she is doing it in the asylum seekers home at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
there she helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German .
of course , it is quite different from a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast @-@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS aims at sho@@ cking women to clarify how important good diet is during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck breasts that are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research indicates that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should undertake .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet in pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions to the new Bern@@ ried sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million Euro expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited Turn@@ halle building on the Bern@@ ried sports grounds is progres@@ sing step by step : in the most recent municipal council meeting , the elabor@@ ated construction application was unanim@@ ously agreed without major discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Board had previously decided on an application for an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; respectively &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the current development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was about permission for a special form concerning the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gab@@ led roof with non @-@ centered first and roof top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be constructed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the planned use of the roof surface for solar installations is the background of the planning : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this brings us together a wonderfully large south roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in turn led to the roof @-@ tilt , which is supposed to lie below ten degrees for energetic reasons - unlike in the development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
for this reason , &quot; liberation &quot; was necessary because the development plan with regard to the ap@@ pre@@ hen@@ sion does not permit &quot; exceptions , &quot; whereby the Council of St. Bern@@ ese in general is more restric@@ tive in the case of liber@@ ating applications .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is not a recurring project when it comes to rever@@ ber@@ ation : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gymn@@ asi@@ um building at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
costs are estimated at around 2.3 million euros .
subsidies are expected by the support of school and Brei@@ ten@@ sport@@ sponsor@@ ships .
in the next process step , the building application for the 18 x 36 @-@ meter hall will now be submitted to the District Office for the Ex@@ am@@ ination .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital is planned to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes a new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au hospital .
the station and the majority of staff move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the unexpected plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß asser@@ ted .
however , a decision on this is due to the Supervisory Board , and the meeting is scheduled to take place on Wednesday , 23 September .
if plans were to be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should go to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the further existing In@@ ner ward .
the rooms are available .
employees who do not go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ iter @-@ White .
the employees are informed of the plans .
the change has triggered the dis@@ miss@@ al of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year and is now changing to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ iter @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer , &quot; who agreed to take the lead from 1 October and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a spread of the offer in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so J@@ och@@ iter @-@ White . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in gastro@@ enter@@ ologic diseases on the In@@ ner ward .
over the next two years , when the Supervisory Board agrees to the next two years , the Supervisory Board is expected to lead both houses until next year the former hospital of the pop@@ lar , which has more than 35 beds , is to be finally closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , when the current refurb@@ ishment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is completed .
country coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the Federal Council , will be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what I close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß could not say that there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present , there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a day @-@ psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fischer of the Qu@@ asi Mo@@ ving to the Le@@ ch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has not been given a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for more than 30 years .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has repeatedly been threatened with closure in recent decades , departments were closed , such as surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .

Jag@@ om@@ incident with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the aber@@ ration on a maize field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ kreis Witt@@ enberg ) several hunters were in action , as the police announced .
after a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
it was unclear how exactly this happened to the accident .
the criminal police investigated .
missing 16 @-@ year old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has taken the police to the body of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old who has been missing since Saturday from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
in the inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their corp@@ se was thrown into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who has been missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to a violent crime .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office and the police .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , arrested on Tuesday evening , was also considered to be a suspect , who was in fact given the indication and led the investig@@ ators to the place of discovery of the corp@@ se .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home after a visit of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of a visit of an autumn festival .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first met personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
in the case of inter@@ rog@@ ations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tances of the missing persons , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the body was found .
according to the authorities , the det@@ ain@@ ee reported to the authorities that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was killed and the corp@@ se was placed in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the port fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him under cover .
the further investigation shall be carried out over the immediate circumstances of the deed .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of apartment gaps
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for affordable resi@@ dences .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction is facing a challenge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the distribution of distribution on the German housing market has long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the incoming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable apartments .
to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany this year .
this way , 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in a first @-@ time accommodation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many then stum@@ ble upon the housing market and join the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers were used for rent in the last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees .
the study also makes considerable om@@ is@@ sions in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is shooting down a housing deficit , which increases from year to year .
currently , some 77@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings have already been missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , lam@@ ented Matthias Günther , author of the study .
for this reason , many professionals were living in large cities in a residential area .
young adults stayed invol@@ un@@ tarily because of the f@@ lau@@ ts in the housing market last longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has dropped again for the first time in recent years .
in order to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; Sozial@@ er housing construction &quot; proposes a new start .
new incentives should stimulate the social housing construction again .
this could be om@@ itted on the purchase tax and the land tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats may be suspended for a limited period of time .
in addition , attractive fiscal depreci@@ ation opportunities are necessary according to the Alliance .
the subsi@@ dy programme for refugee camps of state bank Kf@@ W is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , at 18@@ 4 million euros , more than half of the available EUR 300 million was retri@@ eved on Monday evening .
now the project could even be raised .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia mend a corridor
there is practically no pass to Hungary anymore , as more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia .
Zagreb canc@@ els transit via Slovenia to the north without obstacles .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia about the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have spoken to the Sloven@@ ian Minister of the Interior , and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border de@@ mar@@ cation , hundreds of refugees moved to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people have crossed the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian TV station RT@@ L .
Hungary had closed its border to refugees on the day before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws , which came into effect on the same day , virtually obvi@@ ate the need for decent asylum procedures in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic said : &quot; they can travel through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
but there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police took up the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring country in the morning .
most media reports have been reported from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came to the Serbian border town of S@@ id with both the bus and the taxis .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
the refugees do not reach borders on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border .
this is where the border strip hides other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mine clear@@ ers should now quickly create a safe passage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , after the closure of the border , there are hardly any more refugees to Hungary .
on Tuesday , the police numbered 3@@ 66 .
shortly before the end of the gate on Monday , there were still 9@@ 380 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Hungarian laws stages the overcoming and damage of the border crime as a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
35 criminal proceedings were initiated in Sz@@ eg@@ ed in the south @-@ Hungary border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the condemned threatened prison sentences up to five years and the deportation from the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ onen &quot; set up at the border , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants , there are 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees .
in practice , however , no one has a prospect of obtaining asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; before the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , only a few hundred refugees gathered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected garbage that tens of thousands of people left at the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
locking grids were disman@@ tled and one of the reception centres in the border area was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to express himself to the goal of this reconstruction .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria only few refugees arrive .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
but about 20,000 migrants still remained in the country according to government figures .
in Salzburg about 1400 people wait for the continuation of the journey to Germany .
train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the instruction of German authorities .
in Frei@@ lass@@ ing , smaller groups of refugees met regularly .
mayor drove &quot; ge@@ str@@ and@@ ete &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy on Sunday after the bridge , when ten people were standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to take the train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had un@@ expect@@ edly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday , but because of the flow of refugees , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein an end , &quot; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the rocks along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
prior to that , we first c@@ ased the unexpected guests , with snack and drinks .
we said in the same way , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man was not allowed to receive a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that made us very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers had switched from an ICE in a regional train towards Passa@@ u on Sunday evening , in order to try it after the short notice that the railway traffic was set to Germany , but still to try over the border .
however , the regional train was put off at the Inn before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest linked with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday for@@ soci@@ ably , on the day before a two @-@ leg course sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends further tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke to establish structures immediately in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , our chan@@ cell@@ or has officially and openly moved the attitude of the Hungarian government into the sphere of national socialism .
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now faced with cha@@ otic conditions in the bor@@ der@@ lands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the refugees will have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pro@@ mis@@ ed Land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great challenge in the face of the ongoing flow of refugees and the approaching winter to create decent conditions for people looking for protection .
and it will be an even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter@@ proof lod@@ gings
with the provision of refugees , Konrad has all hands full .
Christian Konrad is used to his word weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to set quarters for thousands of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chaos at the first training centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported on his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the lodging of the 20,000 refugees that came to Austria on Monday was without a great f@@ uss , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Konrad counts with a demand of 85@@ ,000 lod@@ gings in the year @-@ old year .
in order to meet the number , 3@@ 5.000 lod@@ gings will have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to provide the federal states , 15,000 of them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already had talks with the provincial governor .
they would have assured him to create quarters for the coming refugees .
&quot; it &apos;s good in Upper Austria , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier .
the former VP Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , who will be clari@@ fied how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator puts great expectations also into the ORF campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Help like us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are vac@@ ant in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier critici@@ zed the standards for placing as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , it could not be that the accommodation provider had to comply with a certain height of the towel rack or the size of the upper floor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , he is more successful in accommodation , Konrad explains with his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older Lord , whom one does not say without further to the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not cause the Republic to bear any costs as they themselves declared themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
the own search for mapping was not yet successful .
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but apparently there are problems with permission .
Linz invites for a better division
for the time being , no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ Arena and design centers for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as it is currently possible to accommodate those affected without these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further locations should be checked for their suit@@ ability .
the mayor exercises criticism of the division of the refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also contribute here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; boundaries are not sealed off &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , the Gover@@ nor of Germany Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) , on Monday corro@@ des further action on the issue of refugees .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders are not sealed off .
the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there is now just the appropriate border controls .
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being .
the protective hunters , however , would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , Mr P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria now carries out controls on its borders , is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for P@@ ühr@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the German action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Linz industrial line is officially concluded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the publicly tra@@ ded IT group S &amp; T is moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can imagine investing in the start @-@ up companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard and later to acquire some of them .
from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - from which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises something : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
Euro 1.7 million were invested in the site by S &amp; T , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is covered by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 per cent of the 27@@ 00 square metres of residual space in the building are already rented , and for a further 40 percent there are inquiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second store in the arcade
the focus is on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags in the new shop .
in fact Jut@@ ta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
this project had to push the 49 @-@ year @-@ old propriet@@ or of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the do@@ ve market ar@@ ca@@ des : after all , she has now grown in the form of a further business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop in front of the shop , in which they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes of various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously it was rebuilt several weeks ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I long thought if I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deciding factor for the decision was , among other things , that even the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of a location in which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Region that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who have Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion @-@ interest has put Br@@ eit on her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I like most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why some woman gets into rap@@ ture at the sight of a hand@@ bag , the trade lady can also not answer with the last safety .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag of every outfit is enhanced .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called investors .
this quality also connects some with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ setting .
whether it mani@@ f@@ ests itself as an anti @-@ x@@ en@@ opho@@ bic , repor@@ ter or revealing knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office sp@@ ells up the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cuts off well .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate city of K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ öhn@@ hair@@ ur &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a word to many in Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine route . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some in the 1200 inhabitants @-@ village is related to it over -@@ nin@@ ety corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the villa@@ gers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their c@@ aller @-@ city , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous children , including Tr@@ ump and K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , also comes to word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
indeed , there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to think that Tr@@ ump is &quot; a bit of a big mau@@ l , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the loop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - too High German : the don@@ or , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump is coming from the village of the gi@@ ver .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the corner@@ stone of the real estate company was the first real estate in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed in the Bavarian state to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he had once been cut off without permission , the director of the Institute of Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared the start of the film .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes distinctive statements of the descendants .
he repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a boundary wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so symp@@ a@@ thetic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement sees the American rather dis@@ soci@@ ating , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so fi@@ erc@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared for K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension lady Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions how many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters pointed out that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which generally arrived well .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be better if he didn &apos;t win the election , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if this is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if those who had sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting subjects than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my President is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe also without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wen@@ dels Films , for whom Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12 000 movie @-@ go@@ ers , also in the USA is awakening interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper Bavarian town of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the hand of vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 inhabitants village in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ ber villages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award in the neighbouring country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sunrise dominates the reviews despite the attempts of N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Charles Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of leadership of the liber@@ als , but there have been no major shifts in today &apos;s reviews .
the N@@ ine breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull created the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sunrise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a week series of international television programmes , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Canc@@ un .
this disadvantage of the Executive Board did not seem to play a role for Australian TV viewers , since the average of 39@@ 7.@@ 000 viewers in the five capitals grew , compared with today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , Today posted a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number lag@@ ged behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , Today , Today has closed the gap to Sunrise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August Today , Today , Today , Today , Today , Today , Today , Today &apos;s 3@@ 18@@ .000 reached the 33@@ 0.000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50.000 .
until now , the average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 viewers in September is at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the Parliament !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star from Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle down on New Zealand &apos;s coast with his two children , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics had asked if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of last night answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven has been strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and easily hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe scored an average of 44@@ 6,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small win over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia posted 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour a full 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second night of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot seed will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that didn &apos;t manage to over@@ run the Mc@@ Gu@@ ire Show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secrets un@@ disclosed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ ann@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who gains The Bachelor .
the woman , at which Sam Wood landed in The Bachelor , was envel@@ oped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked in with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ pit@@ on Fel@@ lows on the day before out of three , you may have accidentally checked out who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips tight until the finale on Thursday
all three women were ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and thereby called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you don &apos;t , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; their answers might become the per@@ ish@@ ement of who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ ann@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both quickly - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the very first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams energies , I felt they were pretty compatible and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ ann@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood are well @-@ suited as a pair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the house last week made it clear that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the One . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ condition@@ ally adjusted to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked who Wood to choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broad@@ cast@@ ed on Wednesday at 19 : 30 p.m. on Wednesday .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a clever decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game when he lost a don@@ or , as the Aus@@ sie Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ ver@@ ted at his first pun@@ t return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his man and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also to the running game after an injury of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the match .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a also strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the match .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by the special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his cra@@ mp@@ ed catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t that was restored in the first game quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start , Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine any worse start into his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his original debut back then in 2007 , when a passport with his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; free voters are calling for the recruitment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high numbers of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of F@@ W @-@ Herbst@@ kl@@ au@@ sur in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned of a serious crisis at Bavaria &apos;s schools when there are no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools from collapse , &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said .
&quot; otherwise we will get distor@@ tions in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Land@@ tag fraction of the Free vot@@ ers conven@@ es until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , quite different main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees now also dominates the free choice of voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lay the clo@@ ister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as it existed during the wars of Yugoslavia in the 1990 &quot; s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the free vot@@ er boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to post@@ p@@ one the free elec@@ torate as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is why Ai@@ v@@ ans also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W CEO critic@@ ised that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need nationwide uniform standards for federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria push@@ es away , others don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the country &apos;s policy should not fall under the table .
a long lasting torch remains on the agenda : the education policy .
for the new school year , the Ministry of Culture Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot test &quot; Medium Level plus &quot; at 47 grammar schools in which an extension of the secondary school middle level will be tested from three to four years - in the end it will take nine years to finish .
but this is not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we demand freedom of choice for all high schools who want to do that .
free travel to G@@ 9 wherever it is desired .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , senior civil servant , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , with some of them throwing stones and bomb bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before res@@ or@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
20 officers and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets used , of which it is known that they can kill , but which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ ras@@ i say that new provinces that are formed within the proposed new constitution would dimin@@ ish their political influence .
there were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent cl@@ ashes since the 10th century .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been governed centrally for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legislature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the constitution in Kathmandu and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction site planned in the city
the site at the Em@@ den Youth Centre in the Old Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 m2 area .
a mixture of trade , trade and living is planned - but there is still no concrete offers .
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market an approximately 4000 square metre plot in direct neighborhood to the Youth Centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are ongoing .
it is planned to use the premises for a mixture of trade , trade and living .
you are waiting for appropriate offers , it says on the part of the city .
what investor needs to inqu@@ ire is not yet clear .
no contracts have yet been concluded .
the city Em@@ den had bought a part of the property that is located at the Ring@@ straße / corner of the Great Street , already a few months ago and the building can be torn down .
p@@ ieve Project : details are on the table
the plans for a holiday settlement on the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the Investor creates plans for the project for the first time .
many An@@ li@@ eger are still worried - they fear the res@@ ale of their leisure activities
for months it was negotiated behind closed doors , g@@ ag@@ ged , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now there are plans for a new holiday settlement on the small sea near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prospective , the mid @-@ sized Em@@ den company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; System Building &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; presented his plans for the first time in the city development committee of the Council of the Council of the Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of the project critics and the F@@ DP @-@ faction , who accused the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ inger went from the system @-@ building management to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ours now .
the ten @-@ to @-@ twelve million euro project has been in discussion for months .
the pictures and new details on the desired hotel construction were sum@@ mon@@ ed by the violent reactions among sea bu@@ den@@ ers who had arrived at the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , seaside owner and member of the board of directors of An@@ li@@ eger , P@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be a huge kl@@ ot@@ z that over@@ looks all the other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears , like some other project critics , that traffic would increase significantly by the planned size of the system : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be whole bus dischar@@ ges to calculate it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , what happens exactly on the well one hect@@ are site of the former inn is still open .
there is still no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we need to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ asing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this still lack@@ ed , the development plans are still variable .

Google starts dou@@ bling donation campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign to raise 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who have over@@ rolled the European nations , as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donation call on its blog .
instead of making a manager the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee , who fled Kab@@ ul with her family when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark rail and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but as the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million will be doubled to $ 11 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / .
Europe is facing the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely due to the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many also escaped from the war torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery may be helpful for obes@@ e patients .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if obes@@ e people with diabetes live longer after losing weight than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to take food .
over the years , obesity operations have proven to be efficient for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain measure of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ an Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital reported data collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c flu@@ e formation - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I of those undergoing this operation dropped from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments at the age of 29 .
among those undergoing a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disease dis@@ integrated completely and at 28 % partially .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes was dissolved in only one percent , and in some cases only about two percent .
in addition , the results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the blood glucose levels of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce the mortality rate of five years , so the guiding scientist Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared average results with the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the host rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved higher decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) and showed a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show any survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of wei@@ ghty people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people who underwent an obesity @-@ operation , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it would be re@@ ass@@ uring for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their physicians should start taking weight seriously once the patient with his BM@@ I is between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long until we get people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story takes place in H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a topic that currently attracts attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly at school , meets the flock of her youth after years , and falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because it plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the main professional writer grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could place a literary monument in her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East lies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist guide urged to stop the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit in the UK in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford which is dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of the West European countries to the refugee crisis was ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation was not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised German and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as genuine peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we need to think about how killing is reduced in their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack on 11 September and pointed out that the violent reaction of the US pulled a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem is non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used force , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four@@ fold increase of ing@@ es@@ tion of hand san@@ iti@@ zer by children over the past 4 years
po@@ ison@@ er control centers in the US report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve who swal@@ low a strong alcohol disinf@@ ect@@ ant , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of recei@@ pts of hand dis@@ infection products for children under 12 years of age reporting toxic@@ ity control centres rose from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them are landing in need of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children intentionally drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how youth disinf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers allegedly mixed dis@@ infection products with alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wash in order to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; Lop@@ ez said .
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent , which are very appealing to children .
hand san@@ iti@@ zer contains somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in small children , a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison emergency centre in the hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 station in K@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t let slip whis@@ ky around , but people leave these hand dis@@ infection products within reach of children , and when children come to it , it is a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who had recently taken four sp@@ lashes from following Stra@@ w@@ berry Du@@ cts of disinf@@ ect@@ ants at school , was brought to an emergency room for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is considered drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a not@@ ary doctor who treated them at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah told her words and wasn &apos;t able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trauma , since the girl had fallen through alcohol and had pushed her head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and store wall disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol pois@@ oning , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were linked to deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing toxic , un@@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities suspect that the product contains meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which has been listed as an active ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in January three students of the fourth grade in the State of New York planned to poison their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; common &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teacher by putting anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says a police report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ex@@ poses them from their space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police regarded the tar@@ nished plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gesch@@ i@@ ät@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and referred to disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
during a rear @-@ end collision , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old car driver has been slightly injured in a rear @-@ end collision .
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove across the road towards the round@@ about in the direction of the round@@ about and perceived too late that two previous vehicles had stopped at the round@@ about .
as a result , he b@@ umped into the rear of an audi@@ torium with his truck and pushed this vehicle onto a previously standing Ford Fi@@ esta .
in the case of the vehicles involved in the accident , property damage of around 10 000 Euro was caused by the police .
the Audi of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer ready to ride and had to be tow@@ ed .
rum@@ ours of smells : no shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays the talk of di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glas@@ gow , Dei@@ la indicates that the tops are on a bad place , but that he will turn it again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hear@@ ts will combat S@@ FA as a result of N@@ eil@@ son &apos;s accus@@ ation and war@@ bur@@ ton should be cau@@ tious in January @-@ new obligations that could destroy the unity of the squ@@ ad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ ons raise lead over Celtic to five points
Adam Ro@@ one@@ &apos;s el@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time gave Aber@@ deen a tight victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e , so that the d@@ unge@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between Celtic and Celtic .
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
there are rum@@ ours of di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glas@@ gow , which was dismissed spontaneously by Griff@@ i@@ ths . this insi@@ sted that he and his team mates are not under increased control , as they are preparing to confront the Dutch leader of the table .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in the Scottish football bor@@ es Dutch - de Bo@@ er
former R@@ angers &apos; mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title @-@ ri@@ val@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland , they do not show highlights of Celtic @-@ games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here talk not only about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swear Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la accepted that Celtic had to fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent exit from the Champions League , the defeat against ten @-@ man from Aber@@ deen was followed , now with five points ahead clearly at the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this exactly the same - but we must continue .
we really need Celtic support because it makes the players better .
to stand together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton carefully during January transfers
despite his comments just a few weeks ago , suggest@@ ing that he p@@ itted a few January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ Bos@@ s Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious about the signing of new entran@@ ts and insi@@ sts that he does not want to distur@@ b the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x cad@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players coming in the summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Celtic destination Mi@@ ha@@ u with reference to return
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stur@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer period in conversation , indicated that he could withdraw if his contract runs out with the Sw@@ ans .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been pla@@ gu@@ ed with a troubles@@ ome an@@ kles for two years and has not made the departure from Wales this summer .
heard on S@@ FA battle for N@@ eil@@ son &apos;s comments
the Hear@@ ts resulted in 2 : 1 , when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and lost 3 : 2 , but the Red card of the Defender was later removed - the third red card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no integrity in question , I have not commented on performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid ty@@ ro@@ ast@@ le
the in@@ cor@@ rigi@@ ble hi@@ bee was re@@ buff@@ ed after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive texts about Ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the ros@@ eb@@ urn area of Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ te@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Stür@@ mer , and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is certain to say that I don &apos;t return to Ty@@ ler when it does not play for Celtic Glas@@ gow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tann@@ adi@@ ce Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that the Executive Board of Dun@@ dee United still has confidence in the management team to turn things - but it is said that the decline must end on the playing field .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .

Mc@@ Inn@@ es is happy to &quot; win &quot; against Hamilton . &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team from Aber@@ deen is desper@@ ately fighting for Hamilton Ac@@ cies to see a seventh consecutive league victory that gave them a lead of five points ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ &apos;s El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is no team that has won everything in poker games or songs that have not won games of this kind either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it is increasing overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged in the period May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above the 5.5 percent U@@ K@@ s , as demonstrated by the figures of the Bureau for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland dropped by 12.@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland dropped to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government laid the foundations for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost a year ago that Scotland took the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment .
drunk disturbing the drain
since security personnel were unable to satisfy the situation , the police called the police .
only with the use of pepper spray the officials could take the stur@@ geon into custody .
a breath alcohol test resulted in a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 0,@@ 89 per mil@@ le .

why I will be witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
a little later , except for a late legal action , I &apos;ll see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens and I hope that it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison inj@@ ector .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death .
the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
as the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and since more applications are available as seats , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place in order to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will see it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will be next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps closest friend with whom I have developed my own relationship during the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality on Twitter .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it , and you get access .
I weigh@@ ted myself with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she acknowledged that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could have formulated it better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the pod@@ casts I made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all the details again .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the act .
but I believe there is a strong chance that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die of unnecessary death .
man after wet police persecution persu@@ ades to come out of the Cann@@ ing River
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale polic@@ eman was dry when he talked to the man of the Cann@@ ing River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to susp@@ end the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y waters , only a few meters away from a police officer who tried to &quot; gently persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
cann@@ ing V@@ ale Police was called into Beck@@ en@@ ham &apos;s Hou@@ se@@ keeping incident on Tuesday .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them towards Cann@@ ing River .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c wasn &apos;t too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he tac@@ kled more reliable tactics - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negotiating . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car to the tren@@ ches to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .

Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims Ste@@ wards were trying to spy on him and thre@@ aten to finish racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims Ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to stop the race immediately .
he insi@@ sted on the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she had conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai due to a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions than it was about the positive Cob@@ alt plu@@ mage at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had with@@ held 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age alleg@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it was going on .
sometimes one re@@ acts , and one has to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
tonight I will go home and sleep well .
I want to walk around my head and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be a trainer anymore .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously M@@ oo@@ dy had sent the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integrity department had tried to spy out his barn .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do inside my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ wan , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should this bring me to the point of view that it becomes personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out there that I &apos;m it .
maybe they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say is letting them think about it now .
but I have now arrived at the point where I don &apos;t care about it , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the Train@@ ers &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have been based on the long @-@ term cob@@ alt exploration of Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching allowed him to &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the defeated champion Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse debate , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my staff has er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously applied mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been like yesterday all day , which was so .
but it had been so on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy turns back against ri@@ vals for claims on ring battles
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy den@@ ounced criticism of the Tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee allowed the storm @-@ player &quot; w@@ rest@@ ling &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a barely concealed remark to the Storm team after his team reached the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the rug@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ li@@ g of his team and said they were only concentrating on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading trainers in his team felt confident about him as it meant that they were worried about being hit by the storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is emerging again and again - I have not heard Tr@@ ent Robinson said about ring@@ fight as they beat us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our defensive system or techniques all year long . but over the past six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ cles a real focus , and this has provided us with the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not accustomed to losing it so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is funny how this occurs again and again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy attacked Benn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne is talking about exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he would take care of a sh@@ it .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players at their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play as they can .
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts at our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are there p@@ auses and no points of tension ?
for me , it &apos;s the game plans .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase .
the Storm team is free this weekend , as they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday evening in the advance at A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with $ 200,000 Guarant@@ ee on Drug Ad@@ dress
a man who could possibly have a life @-@ long punishment because of his attempt to get into possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a $ 200,000 security deposit .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and started in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the yacht harbour during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a potentially life sentence for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole lot and that in the café could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the danger of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of the criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security in common to reach his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of a safety of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he gave his Australian and his Serbian passport , reporting to the police daily and with@@ stands a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : cab ri@@ ps apart
in a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had slow@@ ed down in front of a permanent construction site towards Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to escape to the left at the last moment , as the police announced .
the driver &apos;s cab was torn apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ North was completely closed from six hours to 2 o &apos;clock .
a damage amount of 12@@ 2,000 Euros was incurred .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to l@@ ure ped@@ ophi@@ le to send pictures
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of a 11 year old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when this fell asleep , log into an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a number of un@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping ho@@ gg .
she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ er@@ ted her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five pictures , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; related &quot; web research that used terms for searching for un@@ solic@@ ited images of children .
Ho@@ gg then claimed to the officials that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ le on the Internet , &quot; and then &quot; preten@@ ding to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor , E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on , said to the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be an ad@@ diction that he was addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
he said he was sick in the head when he drinks and said that he then wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was on the ver@@ ge and crying .
she also saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the accused with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused used computers and pla@@ yst@@ ation to speak with girls who looked much younger than he .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the indictment , to have in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year , to have viol@@ ated the conditions on 25 January of this year and did not appear before the court hear@@ ings on 24 March this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defense attorney Gregor S@@ im requested that Ho@@ gg not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , as one could argue that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be found in his off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael closed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work .
in this case Ho@@ gg was granted a security deposit but was held in custody for hear@@ ings on other pending cases .
he was added to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of the judgment .
slu@@ ice switches to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up in the German @-@ Austrian border away from the main control points .
many of the wrong@@ do@@ ers left people on smaller border cross@@ ings because of fear of discovery and arrest .
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
more than 1000 refugees have been taken up along the border river Inn in Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn districts since Tuesday .
they were on foot over bridges and bar@@ ges onto the German side .
there they are received by Federal Police officers and forwarded to registration .
according to the German Federal Police Reg@@ ulations , more refugees met again on Wednesday at the Munich central station compared with the weekly beginning on Wednesday .
by 8 : 00 a.m. some 700 people arrived in the state capital , said a spokes@@ man in the morning .
after the re @-@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : runner from tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the southwest
meteor@@ ologists warn against storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area in Western Europe , warm sea air currently flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful low is the prec@@ ursor of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who was drawn from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in recent days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent storms and storms are expected especially in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , even up to Thursday early in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Boden@@ se@@ price with bu@@ cks from 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
on Friday , the sun can be seen again for a longer time .
the mass makes it : every two years , the automobile manufacturers show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
2015 is especially noticeable in the compact cars , which are currently particularly well @-@ selling .
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : some 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations accounted for this segment alone in August alone .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
this year , many new compact models will be presented between all futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra , which will be at deal@@ er@@ ships in the autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra will not become much more expensive .
Opel is entering the world &apos;s largest competi@@ tor VW Golf with a view that starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra is priced from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the federal state of Hessen is offering further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines are also included for the first time .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only five @-@ door .
the second option will follow in the spring of the Kom@@ bi , which will also be seen at the IAA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA and new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the trade fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e can only be seen as a five @-@ door in a conventional and sporty GT version .
he comes to trade in the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan install@@ ers want to find their position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .

Ds 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA .
outside the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ er were particularly impressed by the front part : the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights are equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , especially the inf@@ otain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and integrated into Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time .
in addition , at the IAA in the compact class , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants , such as the turbo@@ charged Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are deser@@ ted
the Federal Constitutional Court gave a right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the Judi@@ cial Centre Te@@ gel , which was lod@@ ged in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , in@@ mates are entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells .
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , the parties can even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in the rooms ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
as a result , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful : he was accommodated at the Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel Institute of Justice between June and November 2009 in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated .
after that , the man who , according to his lawyer , had meanwhile been on free foot@@ steps , was transferred to a larger cell .
due to the un@@ question@@ able detention conditions against the Land of Berlin , his district authority failed .
however , the Constitutional Court uph@@ eld the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al and pointed out the case for re @-@ examination .
they see the man &apos;s dignity viol@@ ated .
court court now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if legal reasons for compensation were only a few days of imprisonment for compensation , a compensation claim was given . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ham@@ mer@@ ing of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber judgment must now clarify the amount of financial compensation .
in the past , the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war .
so they only spoke to a prisoner in April because he was imprisoned in a prison cell naked .
according to a decision from 2011 , the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet is un@@ dig@@ ni@@ fied .
furthermore , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , who had agreed to a prisoner in a parallel case a decent housing in a parallel case in November 2009 .
for three months , the former pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff was accommodated daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case .
in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also hit the head@@ lines for lack of personnel .
det@@ ain@@ ees are therefore always included 23 hours , aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even ra@@ ckets must have already come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the judicial review , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of young talent , 19 should fall away in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the chan@@ cell@@ or is determined to accept her .
what comes to Germany ?
according to the Federal Ministry of the Interior , some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated conviction in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following overview shows what is coming to Germany .
according to different progn@@ oses between 350 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Building ) and 400@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) flats are needed annually - and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as ever built ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all for affordable rental objects : yearly , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ ,000 social dwell@@ ings fall out of the rental price bond , and in order to make these particularly favourable apartments , refugees will also apply .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
far too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social dwell@@ ings per year would have to arise and the federal government would have to invest a funding amount of 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both scientists and Federal Buil@@ ders agree that there must also be more tax benefits for housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can work in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany would not have been systematically asked about their qualifications to help them get started , writes Claudia Walter , Project Manager for Integration and Education at the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial to find employment in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the society society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ ust@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to Thr@@ ust@@ y , there has been a political turn : from the prohibition of labour for refugees to recognise work .
while there was a ban on employment for asylum seekers of up to five years earlier , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence requirement that asylum seekers are confined to a place of residence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society , also because of the lack of skilled labour , a majority of the views have prevailed that refugees should be able to access the labour market faster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is lack of knowledge of German .
until now there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
research also shows that jobs are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
for this reason , the structure of networks is the royal road to work integration , according to Thr@@ ust@@ hardt .
the Berlin school administration has found that few wing@@ ed parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the dis@@ car@@ ded parents it is only very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ sche@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family of the benefits of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the demand for educ@@ ators grows strongly due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase its training capacities , for example by allowing more specialised schools .
in the countries , students without knowledge of German will be prepared for classes without German language skills .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ags from the Berlin School Administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle no federal state prohibited asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception was Berlin , inner sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his stance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; study @-@ willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because refugees with a stay reimbur@@ sement or de@@ ple@@ tion do not receive any benefits in accordance with the Act on asylum seekers when they begin their studies .
the latter basically do not get a b@@ af@@ e because they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to commit prey .
patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for b@@ af@@ o@@ grams , from 1 January 2016 this can be shortened to 15 months .
but this financing gap must also be closed , call for Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many people religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually conc@@ ede to Islam the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ churches right to develop a new state religion relationship .
also important would be the creation of an Islamic Wohl@@ fahrts@@ verband ( Islamic Wel@@ fare Association ) , who takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally .
the rights also include obligations .
thus the representatives of Islam must agree to clear contact persons and be ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control options .
this also includes the willingness to take heart against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to escape such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law into Arabic .
in the future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society .
in this way , the majority society will have to change , and the disman@@ tling of discrimination and rac@@ ism will become more and more urgent .
as a result of European decisions , Germany has - as a result of European decisions - for a decade of anti @-@ discrimination and a general equality law .
but it slowly learns how the NS@@ U series showed that the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants &quot; organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans are calling for a long time and why international agreements such as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism Convention in Germany are bound to become reality in the coming years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is in a position to provide medical care to the refugees expected so far , &quot; says President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for man@@ - power and capacity , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
in order to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery demands to hand out health cards to all the newcom@@ ers .
provided services may later be settled with the federal states .
and in the long run it is highly question@@ able to break down so many people with the limited range of services offered by the asylum seekers &quot; law .
apart from that , the doctors in particular make the language barriers created .
already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has shown that migrants are more poorly informed about their diseases than other patients .
it is not only in clinics , but also in doctors &quot; practices that interpreting costs would have to be taken over .
but many refugees would have been helped by more general medical centres in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
in refugee camps , for example , there are much more untreated ob@@ struction , and with the young people it is about HIV enlightenment .
with the partly other illnesses , German doctors come out of their education , but Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite attacks or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the doctors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fight &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the refugees may even be allevi@@ ated in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians had a highly developed educational system , some refugees were even doctors .
in order to be able to practice , they must prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill after estimates of the Federal Institute of Psycho@@ therapy ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
in particular , refugee children are vulnerable , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study by the TU Munich illustrates that every fifth Syrian refugee camp is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffers from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong shock and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms being chronic , early treatment was necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
up to now only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
while psych@@ ically sick asylum seekers can apply for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social offices , in most cases , non @-@ skilled workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illness decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new staging &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to draw each age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the cir@@ cus promot@@ er invites into the arena on the brick , v@@ ases to dream .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ g and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - this is the motto of the current stage production . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family for more than 33 years .
so the gift for enthusiasts is in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take away the people from their daily boy@@ cot@@ t and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with cosm@@ opol@@ itan flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 kilometre tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
awarded the international Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wit and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of silent films , the Cuban duo wants to easily record the Cuban duo .
light@@ ness and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is intended to conquer women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
except through numerous salmon @-@ sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus Pro@@ bst is also fascinated by the feeling of t@@ act and arti@@ cular strength .
balancing on a ball with the un@@ ic@@ ycle ?
no problem for He Yu@@ an .
snake @-@ men fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascin@@ ates with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Steph@@ an@@ ies Mutter , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
ab@@ norm@@ alities in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are all too often subject to various animal welfare organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst also takes a stand : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not good for our animals , we don &apos;t feel good either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each stroke unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artist &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are called lovingly , is read by the eyes as far as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it does not want to get into the man@@ ege .
so the par@@ amount commandment : good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land P@@ ony stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived in an enclosure for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst told . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
so there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1,@@ 200 spectators , we always do our best and are with all their heart . &quot;
the cir@@ cus promot@@ er invites you to his ideas from 17 to 20 September daily at 5 pm and 8 pm .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , for the screening at 5@@ pm the prices are dis@@ counted .
the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is also open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the fall quickly spread across social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by statements made by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them of accompanying Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen .
last month they had blin@@ ded him and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their mobile phones , which they warned of interfer@@ ing with Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he told repor@@ ters about Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warns the affected Parliament members that the immunity in parliament ends and once they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year HP will split up into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and its service business activities .
the expected job cuts result in a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , &quot; said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP chairman and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a broad and in @-@ depth portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before in order to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; will be focused on providing so far un@@ paralleled , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; explains the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical equipment and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage man called &quot; the birth place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to manage the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this area , based on the belief that closely @-@ focused companies perform better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says team @-@ mates must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed about Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of his story , his participation in the next summer is certainly still uncertain .
the great dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing back during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that didn &apos;t heal properly .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also acknow@@ le@@ dges , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the study of Premier Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 out of arsen@@ als in 15@@ 7 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , which have recorded most of the vulner@@ ability .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury ratio will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a reasonable period of time , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win fighting force , &quot; Wen@@ ger said .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
Arsen@@ al starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning that Ma@@ th@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need it , a little break @-@ up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsen@@ al is clear favour@@ ites to advance through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has started in the last season .
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measuring 3,@@ 2 on the Richter scale .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven by far away hope to lead the association to his first European victory with his management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked at Arsen@@ al .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand , I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show , which gives us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the lack of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now even more desperate than ever before , how suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ aig@@ n Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a mis@@ erable life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man , with the goal to question the culture that prevents men from seeking help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms found that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery were doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of spiritually healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends first , so that friendship can work .
in the age of communication led through social media , with its focus on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a significant contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even though in reality isolation dominates .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Beau@@ tiful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Friends was that this focus was put on the head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which was shining through interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments in soccer matches in com@@ fy arm@@ chairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can relate to it , even though they often with@@ hold to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of telephone @-@ pastoral care told me : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; my role of listening to people who are de@@ pressed and at risk of suicide has shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us feel often unable to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as weakness if one speaks openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status about the phone may help people in moments of despair also , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the completely re@@ designed scenery to celebrate the day , why don &apos;t you take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you see someone sitting alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .

angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ die Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria joins the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to drop by Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ die Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö at the Prince Park@@ stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French master the way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their advance when Cav@@ ani reached a head @-@ goal in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk even in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master , as they not only strive for the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the club with whom he began his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , cause our opponents troubles and look back relaxed even if there are certain things that we have to perfect over the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two other goals scored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris Team after his injury , a 2 : 2 un@@ decided in his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed to death in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was called the man who can take PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe , when he was taken over last month by Manchester United , and he pointed out why when he went in to Marco Ver@@ rat@@ ti pass behind Malm@@ ö &apos;s defense before he passed Johan Wil@@ and nicely into the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who hit Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was armed with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field a heavy opponent .
but besides a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed away to Kevin Tra@@ pps Center in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in advance .
instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes abandoned himself , with some mis@@ ses and bad degrees , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who only scrat@@ ched his first half in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ bo@@ oting .
nevertheless he showed a lot more skill if he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c to turn Di Maria into a shooting , which was defle@@ c@@ ted by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . so the Urugu@@ ay@@ an achieved his sixth place of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had caught up a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent way to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the end result low before replacement player E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi finished a door at the end .
the trainer of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de later admitted that PS@@ G played a class on his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then we only played in the Swedish League which did not have the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualification games are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
a few years ago , FC Bayern was shortly before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times winner champion , four times champion league winner , twice the world champion , twice world champion , twice world champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is stunning .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona for 24 years and switched to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i betra@@ ys that he stood before the European fair in 2008 before the farewell from Barcelona .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça was selling me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Madrid won &apos;t do anything at that time , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; he says .
and the registered also the FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot;
in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern .
guar@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this is working for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça accepted Guardi@@ ola and I played a great European . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s playing time was run in 2008 / 2009 with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians across the entire distance on the lawn , the reds broke out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end celebrated the royal class triumph .
matt Dam@@ on playing variety in film@@ making
matt Dam@@ on confronted the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown interrup@@ ts the need for alternative perspectives , in reference to a black protagon@@ ist in the selected script of the project .
&quot; if we talk about diversity , do it with the cast of the film and not with the cast of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Brown was shocked , with offen@@ ded dis@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian fast@@ ened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to encourage people to think about it - who will always be the director - how to treat the figure of the Harmony , &quot; Brown first said .
the only black person , and she is a groove sm@@ itten by her white p@@ im@@ p .
the producer of Dear White People won Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the directing rights to the film . Dam@@ on replied that &quot; in the end her direction &quot; could give us something we do not want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media did explo@@ de before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Po@@ oni &apos;s Twitter user pushed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in the room , so he can explain its variety - that &apos;s SO WH@@ ITE that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its publication .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the head of social discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after killing Michael Brown in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement achieved national action and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against the subject .
in February singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album still matter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black lives , albums still have their mean@@ ings .
more recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation , in response to the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos; American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowns first champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete who won the American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which has just completed its 7th season , has never experienced a competition participant who could finish all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and Camer@@ o@@ ann Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
to the last task , climbing was part of a 75 @-@ foot climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten completed the task within the time that he was the first ath@@ lete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock of winning the great price of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had been alive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac e ! over his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so suddenly .. how I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , did not receive any prize money .
according to the rules , money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful prize and life changes , he gets the great deal of Gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he has any gru@@ dge about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received the masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac felt the same if they had changed the roles .
America N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit tig@@ ers sne@@ aks past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
Min@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit tig@@ ers .
formerly , they once were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field .
the T@@ wins don@@ ned a chance to climb inside a half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card Square .
for Detroit , albeit only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word , which was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad Ni@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit pointed out three times in the first two inner @-@ ings , then once in sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit 6 times in the 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and enabled three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw at bull@@ pen each game , and therefore I want to go into the game very concentrated .
the designated Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit @-@ hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on 6th July .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sw@@ ung the schla@@ gh@@ ol@@ z well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( punch training ) , looked much better at the bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the back@@ yard at the end of the seventh session the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man with whom he was faced , before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run away from the right @-@ h@@ ander Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the finale run in the second , Ver@@ hagen introduced the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play .
it was the 27th time in the Major League , 27th time this season that pl@@ ou@@ ffe beat a Double Play
after adding an Insurance run at the end of the ninth city , Wall created a R@@ BI double against the loser of the tiger Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed , however , st@@ ach S@@ ano in three pit@@ ches for its fifth save .
Detroit benefited from a not moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es at the start of the game .
the tig@@ ers achieved three races in the first two inner posts against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been painted before the game from the list of injuries after he had missed more than a month because of a back suffering .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt better when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter in the first one , H@@ ush@@ es gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to the game , who created a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 success stre@@ ak with the Run@@ ners in the scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers posted in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he did not feel very well , but he got the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning before replaced by the reli@@ ever right @-@ handed photographer A.@@ J.@@ Ei@@ ght .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es it came to three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four strokes .
remarks : tiger R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z was eliminated because of a violation of the throwing school .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , on the vulner@@ ability list since mid @-@ August due to a shoulder tie , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP has stri@@ pped Daniel Mor@@ ris from the vulner@@ ability list to compete against T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the tiger since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
it has been missing since 20 August because of a distortion in the right hip joint .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will finish their series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ota &apos;s R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees shall perish in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people who arrived there should be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the City of Wiesbaden hur@@ ried on Tuesday evening .
it calculated with 450 to 750 arriving refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this case over the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily stop there .
they shall then be distributed to other municipalities .
over the past ten days , 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse have arrived in Hessen , who was responsible for the first recording of the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Gie@@ ßen .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls due to the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe the decisive reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he accused the European States of &quot; collective way@@ far@@ ing . &quot;
four years ago , one was glad that the cup of military involvement has passed in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends up against our front door , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international assistance on the ground for the refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria again established controls on its southern and eastern borders .
Austrian minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner explained on Tuesday evening in the Austrian broad@@ caster ORF , nobody will be sent back to Hungary .
also Germany did not send back refugees to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it &apos;s so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement on which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been talks between the Director General for Public Security and Represent@@ atives of Germany .
she did not call concrete figures and pointed out conversations on Wednesday in Berlin .
over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary .
their goal is mostly Germany .
chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , together with several other EU heads of state and government , requested a special summit next week .
Germany began on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far not been able to agree on a common procedure in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Tuesday ( 22 September ) , the EU interior ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of further 120 000 refugees on a special meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the strong refugee success in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries in the first recording and distribution of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Con@@ federation will manage this jointly with the countries , announced Merkel in the late Tuesday evening after almost four hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined those people who need protection , be@@ ware this too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if you don &apos;t have a lead perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany .
this view was strongly divided in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre border to Serbia during the night of Tuesday .
a few hours later the government announced in Budapest that the border to Romania would be brid@@ ged with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to on the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
in Turkey , in the meantime , thousands of further migrants are making their way to the Greek border .
room probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus
under the ice dance of Saturn &apos;s En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus , a global ocean sw@@ ells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes researchers from observations of the space probe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore the moon stum@@ bles easily on its orbit around the ring planets .
although this movement is only small , but nevertheless too big for a permanently fixed cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state of New York ) from Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the field of &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
it was known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already discovered ice volcan@@ oes at the South Pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds in 2006 , sp@@ ying the water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feeding the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers concluded at that time .
the expansion of the hidden ocean was , however , not clari@@ fied .
R@@ ama missing in Munich several weeks
the 1860 München had to ren@@ ounce Val@@ det R@@ ama for approximately one month .
an examination made an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury at the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , divided the association .
R@@ ama was compla@@ ining about pain early in the week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Munich Li@@ ons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the diagnosis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means a forced break for four weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a crude loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we have to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sports Director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of an un@@ compromising pro@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;

no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his lean lines is often dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ gos contain relatively high sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
nevertheless , the exotic fruits are healthy : B vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular , however , man@@ gos contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor of beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thus support vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
during purchase man@@ goes should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then , of course , they taste pure or in sweet foods .
but a man@@ go also gives a special touch to sav@@ our@@ y dishes .
it allevi@@ ates the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .
the US parcel service U@@ PS raises up to 9@@ 5000 aids for the Christmas business in the USA .
the company has already started recru@@ iting seasonal workers , U@@ PS announced on Tuesday .
above all drivers are sought .
already last year , U@@ PS had increased its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5000 aids .
in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and its competi@@ tor F@@ ed@@ Ex have been making arrangements for the Christmas business since last year .
in 2013 , bel@@ ated deliveries had brought the parcel service to harsh criticism .
first fo@@ eh@@ ner tower , then striking cold front
in the coming night , the F@@ öhn stops in the valleys of the Alps side of the F@@ öhn , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz announced on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and on the night to Thursday the F@@ öhn blows partially with storm strength through the si@@ eh@@ ner valleys .
after the bo@@ oming on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front that brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a drop in temperature .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful south @-@ west current .
on the north side of the Alps , the F@@ öhn breaks through the valleys in the night to Wednesday .
as a result , the F@@ öhn blows up to Thursday morning in the valleys with bends of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partially also with over 100 km / h .
the F@@ öhn can penetrate in places to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains are even or@@ bits of over 120 km / h possible .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair dryer for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , moisture starts to st@@ ow at the Alp@@ ens@@ ü@@ d@@ slope .
rain starts here , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , more than 100 litres of rain per square meter must be expected in the south of the Alps in the next 48 hours , this after large amounts of rainf@@ all have fallen in the last days .
on Thursday morning the air starts blowing , as a result , a cold front with a strong , partially weather@@ ed rain from west to east is rolling over Switzerland .
along with the cold front the wind fresh@@ ens up to stor@@ my temperatures , and temperatures clearly drop .
the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , whereas in the south it will be sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther square in Rome .
in the presence of Mayor Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former .
on the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located right next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um in the middle of ancient Rome .
the name was proposed by the working community of the Protestant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es were often only able to live their faith in the city of the Pop@@ es for centuries .
with the square , it becomes visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of the Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered himself a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
at that time he felt the city as a fallen man of sin .
his negative impressions are likely to have reinforced him by historians in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the split of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his theses on the trade of waste .
Hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with splendid images .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , this can be quite glo@@ omy .
Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project for about three years , for which he has made a subjective and artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
cycles which focus on topics such as cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , commandments , or fa@@ therhood are created .
as a result , he was immediately fascinated by several partners : this applies to the Luther publishing house with its the@@ ological focus as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its emphasis on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who dealt with the biblical passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Old and translated into present @-@ day contexts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original biblical quotation of Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts to the situation in question .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family belonging to the strict protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ h@@ uter @-@ Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the education has been done with the cane &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt ev@@ okes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work up to be able to carry me back with the Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to bring art again to greater value in the fast @-@ pac@@ ed future : &quot; today &apos;s perception of visual worlds is characterised by advertisement , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is being displaced .
artists have a different lust and delight to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewers to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fall into the pictures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they let themselves work , discover and sense the power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture is looking for its opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation &apos;s presentation at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; I always like to have been a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he compreh@@ ends life with his pictures . &quot;
I don &apos;t care to completely capture the Bible , but chose the important topics that are important to him .
&quot; this was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; arose a picture Bible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther &apos;s publishing house , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts paintings speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas prints - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
start of construction for the BM@@ X railway seam
plans were made , place found , company commissioned , earth moun@@ ds for a round course model@@ ed : one year later , almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X track , it was already finished .
om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration were concerned with ver@@ dr@@ uss , especially those who did not want to tolerate the railway .
so hill tow@@ ed , new place wanted - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval was received in October , and the First Community Coun@@ cill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will still happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further memorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the work of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B broad@@ ens its commitment to refugees by 2019 , and the Bundes@@ liga cat@@ ches a clear signal on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football responds to the p@@ itting situation in Germany and ass@@ ures politics its help in tac@@ kling the upcoming problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this for the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t concern me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must interest each individual to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he will discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the chan@@ cell@@ or &apos;s office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State , Mr@@ s Ö@@ z@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the Chancellor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and will help .
but the crucial course must be the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have ensured that this program continues to run until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also some federal li@@ gi@@ sts support this program .
already on this weekend , the 36 Prof@@ essors set a clear sign when they will carry the im@@ print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; on the left tri@@ cot @-@ sleeves instead of the usual sponsor@@ ing logo ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper of Völ@@ ler , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matter of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama is going on everyone , nobody can see it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can help football teams , no , we must use our bril@@ liance , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees that have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig talked about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent character of the league . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on this Friday , the national team of the Women will invite 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a big joint work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license publishers have started their own projects in their places is great .
it is just as great that small and small clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and the next year , the association will jointly provide 300 000 Euros for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government .
&quot; the clubs have already called up all the money for 2015 , &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach .
reports : SAP Executive Officer loses an eye in case of accident
the board of directors of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
in the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the United States , he fell on a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he is almost bloo@@ dless , impot@@ ent , then dra@@ gged out onto the street - he told us this last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can follow his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to run the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board all the time and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer at the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , said the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up once you have fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren spare pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except fighting ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen weather@@ ed a photo and explained that he suffered injuries when he was thrown off the wheel .
he therefore comes as little as a spare driver for the two stam@@ mer@@ ing drivers Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button during the weekend in Singapore , as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback from Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europa League have finally sm@@ ashed .
the national player will also be missing the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga in the du@@ el with the FK Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , we cannot fall back on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if Re@@ us will be back in the Bundes@@ liga championship on Le@@ verk@@ usen on Sunday , the BV@@ B coach left : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return of him to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the high load of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ ank@@ le will not only change its root position on the Re@@ us position .
so he announced a change on the goal keeper &apos;s position .
that is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the space of the Roman citizen Roman citizen .
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the world champion .
however , Tu@@ chel was open to the future in all European league games .
with a high probability he will also contest the second game .
Mit@@ ch Re@@ us said that the final entry for the BV@@ B in the Europa League has to be the goal , mid @-@ field player Julian Wei@@ gl as understandable : &quot; this is not so wrong with Marco . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot Cars : government wants to lead the way for Germany
according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the transformation of the car .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , envis@@ ages investment in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday in Frankfurt , Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility age &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Frankfurt Motor Show . &quot; &quot; &quot;
automated and networked driving will improve road safety and reduce traffic jams , &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt .
he also wants to discuss the topic with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who come together with representatives of the industry at the IAA .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transportation , among other things , highlights the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid conversion to digital radio communications .
a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria is currently being developed for testing new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks are imposed on the driver , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legal framework and , where necessary , to adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use internationally that the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicles is lifted from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only envis@@ aged people as drivers .
in automated driving , the car is increasingly taking the lead , the driver becomes more and more passengers .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be expected only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
value added in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the Germany site estimate the authors of the 20@@ 25 study to about 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD traffic politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted on Wednesday by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the research organization Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonom@@ ously driving cars will prevail in the next ten years , 32 percent only reck@@ on in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe in it at all .
in France , 21 percent of those surv@@ eyed until 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , 33 percent in the United States .
in Germany , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the Digital Union Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads .
on the highway , the traffic in flowing traffic could be 15 percent , and 45 percent in traffic jams .
good any fourth person would leave the car under no circumstances .
Bol@@ l says team and double start at table tennis EM
according to the current status of the title campaigns of September 25 to October 4 , the Düsseldorf @-@ based Düsseldorf will only open its doors in the single .
the final decision should be made at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are strong enough , even without Timo to clin@@ ch the title , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ bark@@ er Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this time , Bol@@ l was on the flight to a long @-@ term arranged sponsor@@ ship date in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Individu@@ al European Champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ etz@@ tal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also rec@@ alled the European Championship in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo also lack@@ ed , and we have become European champi@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should be guided by this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the World R@@ ist Fi@@ fth . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins that look terri@@ fying human thanks to video projections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the great star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men into skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ak , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from September 18th at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer changed his initially negative attitude towards a show on his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a little bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you get to the museum .
the impressive collection was previously made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed overall artwork , for which a lot of effort was carried out : to fr@@ ying the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was specially committed .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have car@@ ded 14 tons of material according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was another special feature : a leather pants outlet with cor@@ set .

&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gau@@ l@@ tier &apos;s old ted@@ dy is also shown in the exhibition .
it stands for the designer &apos;s first , z@@ ag@@ matic fashion efforts .
as a kid ( he wasn &apos;t a good student and bad in football ) he dressed his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him .
he later taught the design of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
for his first own fashion show he did not have to pay the models .
they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of sheer curtain - P@@ lau@@ en tip as fashion niche
it used to be on the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and lace arose in large quantities for customers , which they used for example in ceilings and she@@ ers .
today , this alone is no longer working , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en family .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ en peak , fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewellery , accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vintage fashion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that leans against past Sti@@ le@@ po@@ chen shows an increasing order potential . &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who do not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already make half of all orders .
Mo@@ solvent P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the Industry Association of P@@ lau@@ en Sp@@ itz and embroi@@ der@@ ies together with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
in the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken .
there is almost no private trade and wholesale trade .
our products hardly reach our customers in this way .
today , mass goods are made much cheaper in the Asian region and are sold almost exclusively via chains .
it also weak@@ ens exports , currently to Russia and to the US .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to score points with environmental awareness , as explained by C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the embroi@@ derer in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year we have a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berg regional office of the West@@ säch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - special@@ ising in embroi@@ dery and lace .
in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the companies that must think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design will often only be slightly modified to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historic snow@@ ball point .
at some places , the machine sticks small spheres .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the pl@@ um gold@@ smith Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took inspiration from it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously I couldn &apos;t start with traditional P@@ lau@@ en tip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex process it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ en Peak - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and its surroundings and who would like to have a mem@@ ento .
with this I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ en tip .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
legends are not to be touched , but Disney nevertheless vent@@ ures into a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
according to the &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it is not a new movie but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes place 20 years after the first film with the magical children &apos;s girl .
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny and the B@@ anks family in times of the Great Depression in England .
those who play P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the director is already clear : Ro@@ b Marshall , last with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the cinema . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy more broad@@ ly for the world
the economy has to open more broad@@ ly to promote growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday a group that was t@@ asked with the steering of the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should be committed to attracting foreign investments and know @-@ how and improving the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Leadership Group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to promote new start @-@ ups and promote reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , X@@ i said .
the management group has adopted a number of directives , including a negative list for the regulation of market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the inhabitants milking system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that do not question for investment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system is gradually being tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance as it as@@ signs a greater role to the market in the allocation of resources , ensuring a legal state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art business environment and open the market more open , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to the companies and ensure that companies decide how to manage their businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas are opened for private investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the ri@@ ghtful interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optimizing the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury level in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and thus increase the dose of the neur@@ on to the consumer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which is a corresponding EU paper paper , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force to pregnant women and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish are to be lifted from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury each kil@@ ogram of fish .
large pre@@ dat@@ ory fishes are already so strongly polluted with mercury , that on the basis of the still valid limit values approximately 50 percent of the cat@@ ches are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ market@@ able .
according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram in return for this loos@@ ening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fishes , such as car@@ p tend to be so low that they are keeping the planned maximum values already today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dy reduction manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal heavy metal which is highly toxic to humans , especially in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already low amounts can cause damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is primarily caused by carbon burning in the environment .
according to written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power stations come across more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total volume issued in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish approximately in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and nationwide exceeded &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted in March from the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
