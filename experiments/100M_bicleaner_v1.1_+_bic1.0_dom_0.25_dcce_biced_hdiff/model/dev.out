Obama welcomes Net@@ any@@ ahu
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing actions in the Middle East .
but at the meeting it should also be about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and th@@ rows Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
by the deal adverti@@ sed by Obama for the Iranian nuclear program , the relationship of the two has deterior@@ ated further .
in March , at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech in front of the US Congress which was partly regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected it with reference to the upcoming election in Israel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an emergency call Professor to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb talked with a somewhat supp@@ ressed voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house .
lamb was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone .
inside the house the officials found the corp@@ se of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was scri@@ b@@ bled on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ emble@@ y Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff had heard shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb had made the cat@@ astrop@@ hic emergency call sometime later .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took the life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after the shooting in the university , students and lec@@ turers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get an idea of what Lamb is motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ sh died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history .
Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both were taught in the Social Sciences and History Department , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended courses from both .
at the same time there were some in@@ clin@@ ations about problematic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers who praised him , said he seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for an absence for health reasons and said he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion that Lamb had worked so hard for him would not constitute a guarantee for an automatic way to employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the escape from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs later , when he went back to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home country on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ yl Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
lamb started its work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city of about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and pedago@@ gy .
in the spring he did his doctorate in pedago@@ gy .
one of the long@@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through joint friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to teach her the guitar game .
at that time he was the flock of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls melted away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ sh obviously had some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ sh , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail stepped up both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings its own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked on @-@ line for various companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a dim@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ er Night at night 5th September for the last time , after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica game before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no indication that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were cleaning up and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in indigenous people and colonial history , &quot; said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the Student Committee .
about 900 people attended the Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and on Tuesday evening , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght commemor@@ ative celebration .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the night watch , while the university choir sang &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot;
lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police have now said that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that lamb in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ er claimed to be his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
To@@ ys R Us plans to hire less labor for the Christmas season
To@@ ys R Us says that it won &apos;t be as many Christmas season employees as last year , but toy and baby products dealers say that he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said that it planned to hire 40,000 people in shops and distribution centers throughout the country . in the 2014 season , 45@@ ,000 workers were employed .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .

while the holidays are even months away , the Christmas business is approaching , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip stores with employees who sell , ship and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were sitting in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the film begins and it comes to my mind that I &apos;m a simulated co@@ cker@@ el and an arm length away from being on a Date with the Princess of Wales .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , and with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest time @-@ travel film ever made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back in Time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be on VO@@ D , DVD and selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon is saying his answer to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the conflict spann@@ ing almost five years , and more weapons will only exac@@ erb@@ ate violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN boss once again calls upon all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution .
B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the margins of the General Assembly &apos;s minist@@ erial meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ an called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they have proven in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey values showing that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some tried to fire him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans attempt to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks in surveys down@@ wards , it has ( yet ) not worked .
ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that during this time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of whom had even won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ um@@ ps stamina and begin to drop their dollars to overthrow him .
here are some current survey data suggest@@ ing that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a passing phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps popularity ratings were turned by 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey by the Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two out of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now , six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive opinion of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures hold in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son manages about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Repub@@ lic@@ ans do not see Tr@@ um@@ ps Temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive remarks , 52 percent of Irish voters tend to believe that real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right tem@@ per for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is seen in the nation &apos;s first pre @-@ election state , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans think he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 per cent think that he did not have the personality to effectively carry out his office , and almost six of ten independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament was not in the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they set up their scholars , Republi@@ can vot@@ er Tr@@ ump is real .
if they are asked who is most likely to win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
that &apos;s a change since the time four of ten put their money on J@@ eb Bush from ten at the end of July .
full disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination compared to only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it is apparent that a variety of GO@@ P voters watch Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Republi@@ can gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is still beating almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership while the anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is distributed over a dozen other candidates .
but a survey by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is re@@ aping the majority support .
he points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ head race .
a tight majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
a new C@@ BS / NY@@ T survey on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have firmly assigned their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nonetheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competi@@ tor at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their mind are twice as often for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ ape &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immigrants from Mexico two months ago , the immigration was turning and fishing in the public discourse of 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic way of Tr@@ ump will keep pi@@ vot@@ al His@@ pan@@ o Americans out of the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but after the new N@@ BC / Post @-@ survey on Monday six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration issues .
so long as the immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do it .
the fru@@ stration of the government is climbing to new levels .
in the meantime , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son accounts for about half the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days pol@@ l of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience .
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines registers / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , 54 per cent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; inter@@ rog@@ ated . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential districts in Germany
here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg you find the most expensive residential complex with a view over the North Sea .
in the street , a square meter of a roof@@ top house costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 Euro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which particular locations one square meter costs the most .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top @-@ class places , however , one of the prices comes like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Angel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square footage in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of euros per square meter .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top .
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
two tw@@ ins in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bavarian star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hit from Thomas Müller pa@@ yed the way to the FC Bayern 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze created a dream start to FC Bayern in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission of Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission of Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of coaches P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their first game in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry ( 8@@ 9th ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth expedition success in series is supposed to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
in his 28th strike in the Champions League to the Bavarian lead , Müller was rewarded with the help of Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who made a shot of the world champion remembered as a flan@@ k .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bavaria captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m before the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is Stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich held word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated vision without gl@@ it@@ tering .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus has won his most recent six home games in the royal class , among them well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund also stum@@ bled ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bavaria , un@@ defeated in seven European @-@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they ran bol@@ dly , but in their offensive efforts they were often too in@@ ventive to works .
the attacks were often initiated by a shift on the left @-@ hand side of Douglas Costa , which was rare against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller was more fortunate from the right when his flan@@ k came out of the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion awarded the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , when Olympic @-@ stri@@ ker Ide@@ ye Brown hit the pole of the Pol@@ es off the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct debit , the go@@ al@@ keeper will par@@ take Roberto with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians moved their usual dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus has succeeded in setting needle stit@@ ches .
but Manuel Neu@@ er was on the door@@ keeper .
for instance , when he drew a shot of ide@@ ye across the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
first of all , Guardi@@ ola left a four chain with David Al@@ aba in the center near Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it good .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , was sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sports Director Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to do something else , this is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even with the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to the beaten Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59 . ) .
Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made everything clear for 13 minutes , mil@@ led by El@@ f@@ meter .
before the match it had come to Kra@@ v@@ allen in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly war@@ med Bayern fans in their audience @-@ block apparently provoked the followers of host Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces interven@@ ed and attacked the Munich tra@@ ilers with bat@@ ches .
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
the good news : if there is no risk , the risk decreases quickly .
smokers have a clearly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several employees of the German Institute for Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison to non @-@ smoking smokers , smokers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely to increase the 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3,@@ 6 @-@ fold .
the scientists observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
the main causes of tooth decay are cavi@@ ties and inflammation of the gum , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors .
the link between smoking and tooth loss is therefore due to more frequent inflammation of the g@@ ums in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who quit smoking could reduce their risk in a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take more than ten years before the danger once again fell to the level of non @-@ smokers , explained author Thomas Dietrich from Birmingham University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smokers , said the Head of Study H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our knowledge , also leads to good dental health up to the old age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population ages 65 to 74 years of tooth@@ lessness , the DI@@ f@@ E divided .
earlier studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study supports the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists stum@@ ble on remain@@ ders of late anti@@ quity in Cologne on the Rhine .
archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the first time .
in the vicinity of the building site for the new Rhine Boulevard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum have dug skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , says museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine , historians are searching for so @-@ called floor monuments .
for all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as the Department of Archae@@ ological So@@ il Protection .
in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists have now found it .
from text documents it has already been known that , in the fourth century , a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , explained Trier .
beside the remains of the fortress and the church tower there was also a cemetery with some 350 graves that belonged to the church .

EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute over TT@@ IP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to tigh@@ ten the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TT@@ IP , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system which , in its functioning , corresponds to much more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström responsible for the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de has decided to bring the proposal as a European negotiating position to the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
TT@@ IP aims to create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings see in concrete terms that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries .
a second instance is provided for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would allow us to appeal against judgement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far the parties involved agreed among themselves arbitr@@ ators , there was no possibility of objection to their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past months it has become clear that citizens weren &apos;t familiar with the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , she wants to work towards an International Investment Court in accordance with his own specifications .
there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be clari@@ fied .
the investor state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) , which are mainly demanded by major corporations , are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great opposition in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice that companies can exploit damages to the tax@@ pa@@ yers , break down national laws or cut down consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organizations such as Camp@@ act identified the proposals of the European Commission as insufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been critic@@ ised above all that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
on the other hand , the German Minister for Economic Affairs , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , described the plans as a great advance .
the Commission included key points in the reform that the Federal Minister of Economy , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration is from the table .
the French government , too , welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against limiting the legal action of the economy by too many new rules .
in this way , especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
the talks on the Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ( TT@@ IP ) agreement remained unclear on Wednesday .
negotiations have been ongoing since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is deemed to be no longer durable .
delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart which the timi@@ d in@@ timi@@ dated folk singer has recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt @-@ tip pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is nearly seized by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells us about various places he always draws on the map , about his meti@@ cul@@ ously arranged songs .
where they came into being and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderful creative innov@@ ator .
with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State , &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs , harmon@@ ically very close to American folk of the late 1960s , seem to be able to drift in great opul@@ ence at any time .
it is rum@@ oured that &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; would be the first part of a dar@@ ing series : each of the 50 US states should be held in a row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and in the Rhine near the river &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and has positive expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician living in New York returns to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) a comprehensive masterpiece is released in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bor@@ dering on ideas and styl@@ istic refin@@ ement .
the album entered the Bill@@ board charts and is missing in no one @-@ year list of influential music media .
after very productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic fragments .
this sixth decent studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , yet performed by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effects and rever@@ b .
from the smaller clubs the stage shows become a colourful spectacle made of ne@@ on head@@ bands and big fluorescent stage decoration .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five member band .
in the dark @-@ kept ham@@ burger more !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although now nearly 2000 guests are sitting in their chairs , the distinc@@ tly more mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and folk .
without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one hears from the audience : the talk is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and one can basically throw away the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only after an en@@ core comes St@@ ev@@ ens mo@@ dest@@ ly , plays acousti@@ cally a few older songs and finally deca@@ ys with thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gran@@ ce
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut will be eag@@ erly awa@@ ited in the Prime Minister &apos;s interviews with suspen@@ se
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s fra@@ cking and for the first time set up with David Cameron . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to make the first of his six pre@@ determined questions shortly after noon , whereby his performance is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour MPs from near .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile , during a commem@@ oration ceremony on the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent during a commem@@ oration ceremony for the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the centre of several song stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a Mr Cor@@ by@@ n spokes@@ man said he had &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence , &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told in the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of Shadow Mini@@ ons have refused to serve the top team in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , and they are referring to differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party initially supported him as a leader .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also within Labour , &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s remarks on the position of the European Union and limiting profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference said that Labour has made changes to remove all the idea of a bo@@ unds overall .
hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow working and pension minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to lower the limit of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he has been T@@ ory CEO over the last decade of the Dis@@ patch box in the Parliament .
the Labour leader who promised another politi@@ cian said that he had &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas on Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the Prime Minister &apos;s questionnaire is too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he will refrain from both &quot; comb@@ at@@ eness &quot; and stri@@ fe with bar@@ bs , and instead decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , who will represent the Shadow Economy Minister if he does not participate - for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally spoke the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the lower house , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy &apos;s show , &quot; which is often linked to the prime minister &apos;s fragment . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television in 1990 , the prime minister was considered the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Com@@ mons and his position among his fellow parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far @-@ reaching reforms .

pound increases through accelerated job growth in the UK
the pound increased by le@@ aps and bo@@ unds according to data which increases the growth in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ B@@ Miller bid goal .
between May and July , the income without bonuses in the UK increased by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage since 2009 was the fastest and most accurate assessment of the timing of an increase in interest rates .
the pound went up by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after the tak@@ eover offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v was received .
a transaction would combine the world &apos;s two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies and bring together brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher after encouraging news from the competition Group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures hit all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth once more .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core increased 5 % after the mining industry said that it had taken $ 2.5 billion by a stock sales as part of its debt reduction strategy .
the shares of the packaging and paper group Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decline of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his assessment for the company R@@ ating on &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % , following a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages are endanger@@ ing expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate the higher labour costs for his company , he says .
the cost could hit the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A @-@ Poster &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brings Lebanon to a potato @-@ twe@@ eter idea &quot; &quot; &quot;
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
both - namely in the potato @-@ twe@@ eter developed by the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ owner , Han@@ i Al@@ hay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay has put potatoes and meat together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had seen on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , a grill sk@@ ewer served in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; that &apos;s Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the idea was to have the Lebanese registered with the Patent Office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
that is why Al@@ hay does not want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer has .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding also goes well with its customers .
Met@@ cash starts soil resistance campaign to combat al@@ di@@ - inf@@ estation
Met@@ cash attempts to protect the I@@ GA branch from an Al@@ di advance in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ cash has launched a campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailer in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets enhance their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and store owners who sell cheaper tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defensive strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment will carry out its annual investment strategy day .
it is much at stake as South Australia and Western Australia accounts for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailer have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in Eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that , twelve months after the opening of its first markets , Al@@ di will cut around five percent of the food market in these two countries and take away sales of all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailer could lose $ 360 million per year and cash cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opens 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in the food and food business and in the amount of high fixed @-@ cost Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s could cost Met@@ cash around € 13 million before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash lost market shares in the eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s revenue in the food and food business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2017 and reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash declined to respond publicly to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a member of the Board of Directors of Met@@ cash took contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 , i@@ G@@ AS market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operational debt reduction with simultaneous print on sales and margins .
however , wholes@@ al@@ ers are resist@@ ing and investing more than $ 150 million in selling prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and to improve I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores by increasing rapidly growing fresh foods and delivering a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s chief executive manager Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and shop refurb@@ ishment programs will grow to El@@ an and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will again return to a profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios , and , according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly , deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his own conduct .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented duo , who is always referred to as &quot; Special Cat , &quot; got into the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght by the not@@ orious fight of Cy@@ ren@@ eg@@ gios with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , Har@@ rison called : &quot; V@@ acc@@ in@@ ka would have killed Cy@@ rene , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was finally seen how he beat a tennis ra@@ cket , after crashing a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is von He@@ aly was st@@ ably defended .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ gow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the sole behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m quite en@@ vious about is the fact that after my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was dra@@ fted into the fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost due to a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of appreciation .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too severely .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he adapts to the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is practi@@ sing hard , he &apos;s good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to take the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; common decision &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday and he describes the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; common decision &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term fixed component to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we wish that the team is entirely focused on the competition and not all of the controversi@@ es around &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Nick has made a very quick rise to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he climbs in the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to support him the consequences of his actions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary &apos;s refugee crisis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states emergency , closes the border , holds refugees back &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary declared the state of emergency and regulated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to come illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants arrested in a man &apos;s land and Serbian officials re@@ acted with indignation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a land stri@@ pe along the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations got up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and shou@@ ted insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of them rejected food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign minister explained that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary were sent back , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece were arriving . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; discussions with Brussels and other countries will have to take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border a day after the 28 @-@ Nations block at a controversial meeting in Brussels couldn &apos;t agree on a common immigration policy .
the ministers , however , agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the over@@ crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states would accept another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis on the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary did not put its hopes on a prompt action from Brussels or its neighbours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art emergency meeting in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could block streets and speed up asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having completed a fence on the Serbian border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were deployed to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East into the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the upcoming economic refugees are looking for a better life and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that stands strongly in opposition to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or damaging the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 foot ) high fence that the government built along the southern border to Serbia led to a crime . these laws also set higher prison terms for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the military use of the military , expected next week , but repor@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have seen on the border heavy armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws .
the authorities are quick to repair the fence .
Hungarian officials also closed on Tuesday morning two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , having arrived at a train carriage with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and press a crowd to inv@@ ade .
about 20 people managed to get in , but thousands stayed outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s head shot before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to lead a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race for nomin@@ ating at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face against the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the pre @-@ election ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is can@@ did@@ ac@@ ed for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is determined by which candidate they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their election than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders earned some profits .
Clinton has a great advantage over women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished .
their support with the men has declined mark@@ edly , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage with democratic voters under the age of 50 has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Clinton has a big advantage over the older voters .
last month , Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit advance in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the local elections say that they would enthusi@@ astically support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her .
the views are more bl@@ ended with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusi@@ astically support them .
while 48 percent of democratic voters are saying that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this over its top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want it to be the candidate , the most common answer is that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman president becomes president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
agreement to deal with the problems and the elec@@ torate will also be cited .
since the vice president poses a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not .
if democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
more than half of Clinton &apos;s followers say that Bi@@ den is their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to run for the democr@@ ats &apos;s nom@@ ination , H@@ illary Clinton increases his advance from S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election , but this number has dropped by 78 percent last month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; selectable &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , with the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as in the past month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out for these voters of the prim@@ aries as unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristics of voters in the prim@@ aries of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den consider maj@@ orities as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den performs best with the three candidates in hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have any opinion of it .
democratic voters of the prim@@ aries generally also see Clinton , S@@ ander and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server are still being asked as Secretary of State during the term of office , most Demo@@ crat voters are satisfied with explaining the matter and saying that it has not influenced their opinion overall .
but it is another story in the American public overall .
half of Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about a third is satisfied .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on their general opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion had deterior@@ ated from it .
they are mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say their views of Clinton have become worse .
although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy of the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them among registered voters . only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 62 % of voters do not keep them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , 55 per cent of the eligible voters view Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump however get good marks on leadership .
from the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush are best cut off with hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders as honest , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pre @-@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves to Donald Tr@@ ump close to the nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is close to Donald Tr@@ ump at the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times pol@@ l .
meanwhile , half of the vot@@ er &apos;s support in the new survey is om@@ itted , and others lose a lot of support .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers nationwide . the support is growing 23 % in the last C@@ BS Survey , conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , by 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son grew from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passes Tr@@ ump from Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is kno@@ cked down with Wis@@ con@@ sin Govern@@ ors Scott Walker , who has fallen down most , from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
the former Gover@@ nor of Florida , J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are 6 % in third place .
the margin of error in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest pol@@ l is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son is rising in the poll@@ s - he ends with 19 % support with Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump well ahead of Car@@ son .
with a look at a Car@@ son ascending in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon himself , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , there is already a trip to the Mediterranean for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find still warm water .
a bath in the North Sea or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North Sea and Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares .
bathing temperatures , on the other hand , continue to offer the Mediterranean Sea : in the east , it even goes up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic , it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt rises to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ ers
almost two years after a student died during the deportation of a student joint in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges were lod@@ ged against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ derschaft attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , divided the police .
officials said he had been loaded with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the 911 call number after Den@@ g fain@@ ted and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , goo@@ gle his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice , police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide items and basically put the welfare of the Brotherhood on that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ emble@@ ef Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeated with bl@@ unt force injuries to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; too many families have been destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student died at the ch@@ ic@@ anes every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer representing D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fr@@ ater@@ ni@@ ties and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for the murder of the Third Gra@@ des for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of victi@@ mi@@ zed attacks and the formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we not only want to take responsibility for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that has sanc@@ tioned this , officially or in@@ official , we will also be ac@@ coun@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation with the local community .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rise of interest is coming and the house will be shaken , yields for bonds will rise and the economy will slide into recession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy offers only little guidance for the process .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate rise and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments respond .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when it starts to increase interest rates , but rather on the period required for normal@@ isation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , market participants could find , however , that all the excitement was exagger@@ ated due to an increase in interest rates .
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still on too low levels to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no effect .
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market saw last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the impact is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency for assets to be reduced from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which might reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what is going on after the F@@ ed &apos;s interest rate increases . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , the market has in the past 35 years mostly upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to increasing interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average yield in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis published by Bob D@@ oll , Chief Operating Strate@@ ge at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the return thus begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote it .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession .
it is very remarkable that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at a rate increase of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 tick @-@ rate increases since 1950 had only twice the nominal GDP of less than 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect it to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inser@@ ting increases in such a fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raises the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is it different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants held a interest rate of the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading has only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all increase cycles from 1950 to this day have taken place in a super @-@ cycle with increasing momentum in GDP , and pre @-@ rec@@ essions sh@@ ook very quickly after the beginning of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest one the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months .
the fixed income was also volati@@ le as the market anticip@@ ates an increase in interest rates , and the pattern is pretty much the same as on the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in shares if they change their strategic course .
loans seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / decrease is done in the cycle .
at the end of the increase cycle , the bond yields immediately fall , the Deutsche Bank said .
Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b &apos;s strate@@ gi@@ sts believe that the increase in interest rates will result in yields between longer and shorter bonds closer together and leading to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high @-@ interest loans often yield better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher returns , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
Jones , Jones , believes that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest has risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , credit margins expanded and volati@@ lity has increased - all the features of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy .
in the large and large , companies that handle the greater part of their business operations in the US will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts will be worse , as a rising dollar will make their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after initial interest increase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analy@@ st in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded an average of 5 percentage points on average after each of the advertising increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital returns and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with lower quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt becomes a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest rates are losing the most , Gold@@ man said .
outside of pure stock plays , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; savers could see gains through higher yields , even if experts in different opinions are how fast this will take place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Member of Parliament Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament &apos;s Conserv@@ ative Assembly critic@@ ised the station for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cur@@ v@@ ature &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ish@@ able from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; author Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attacked the voice and said that this is not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns &quot; to Classic FM , maintains a leading member of Parliament and raises new pressure on the channel to prove that he does something that the private sen@@ ders do not do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham also said the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public broad@@ caster &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distingu@@ ish@@ able from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name .
so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ing@@ ham .
BBC General Director rejected the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and education to the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I will not learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works is really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that tough@@ er had to be worked to engage the public when it did so in the past , because the British were less informed about classical music .
however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which , during the hearing in the Committee on the Sel@@ ection of Culture , Media and Sports , came under fire to tread the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins took over The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George was produced as a judge - &quot; in special BBC mode . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that he wanted the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the next time there was a batch of entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from further ranks of The Voice in the future , or to spend money from the fee counter@@ s for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales slow@@ ed down in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed the issue in November
for over a decade , virtual shopping has bo@@ oted , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost towns .
but experts say that there are signs that online sales will stagn@@ ate after new numbers show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index of the Guardian .
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now it oscill@@ ates , and we may experience that the growth dimin@@ ishes .
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for decreasing revenues .
experts believe that purch@@ as@@ ers will hold back their purchases prior to this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gains and some dealer sites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , where the buyers strug@@ gled for bar@@ gains could stop buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 output was spent a little more than £ 1 online .
in some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now carried out via web @-@ shops .
at the same time more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion labels in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca during the crane accident - bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first burial places in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia lays down the collapse of some of the huge Saudi @-@ bin Laden groups
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the victims who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed to Mec@@ ca &apos;s great mos@@ que .
mour@@ ners filled , dressed mostly in white , the route to pay their respect when the first of the dead took their last trip to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the procession passed by the Holy Place where only days before a building crane collap@@ sed through the mos@@ que &apos;s ceiling and then on the worshi@@ ppers .
the bodies were released for burial when the Saudi king had san@@ ction hanging over the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster that left 3@@ 94 injured .
the corp@@ ses of 29 people who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed by the Great Central mos@@ que of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram of Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who were on his first pilgrimage to support the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden Group would not have let the arm of the Cran@@ e stand when it was not used .
an Arab version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company was forbidden to travel abroad .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the down@@ fall of the crane , which collap@@ sed into an inner courtyard of the great mos@@ que , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before the H@@ add@@ sch , which later this month is taking place .
the Bin Laden Group has not issued statements about the collapse of the cranes , and their representatives were not available for comment .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also t@@ amed the group because of not up @-@ to @-@ date security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes are surrounded by Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mos@@ que as part of the massive building project headed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been associated with the Saudi royal family for decades and is taking over major construction projects .
the de@@ ceased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the collapse of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said that 15@@ 8 people stay in hospital .
government officials stated that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) are to be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other injured are given half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Bos@@ s says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
British increasingly occupy craftsmen , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has stepped up
this will result in 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops target@@ ing tra@@ des@@ people
at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher will close 60 B &amp; Q outlets throughout the country
from Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that Br@@ its lay down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of employing qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out their work in their homes .
if you can deal skill@@ fully with a hammer or a brush to painting walls , you seem to belong to a minority today .
the British are increasingly occupied with professional tra@@ des@@ men to carry out DIY jobs in their homes , the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , the new managing director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the hardware chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe , offering services at frozen prices , is now over@@ taken .
for this reason , King@@ f@@ isher is planning to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at tra@@ des@@ people and close 60 retail outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten buying decisions in the store were hit by women .
at the moment , men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that show more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is still a majority of men working in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this more strongly towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the head of a UK listed in FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in executive positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is the only company that has exactly 50 percent of the team occupied with women , including its Executive Board and Chief Financial Officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ f@@ isher reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and turnover , after the Group deb@@ ated the cost of closing the stores .
due to the trends , King@@ f@@ isher , who has Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity before the court
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball runner A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and public spending .
the defend@@ ants ple@@ aded not guilty .
one of them had also been accused of abuse .
he was legally acqu@@ itted from this alleg@@ ation in May .
the current process was postpon@@ ed .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the preliminary investigation cryst@@ alli@@ zed that the defend@@ ants used funds from the association accounts in the years 2006 to 2011 , which they were allowed to disp@@ ose of in their functions for private purposes .
he has estimated the damage at around 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sports officials are also indic@@ ted for financial off@@ ences .
this fact expi@@ red the Chairman of the Sho@@ v@@ eller Senate , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
in the event of dis@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that no asset had ever been made to the association .
the sports officials had only charged allowance and the sports club for whom they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and where they had invested a lot of time and money from the debts - the liabilities amounted to around 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euros ) in 2001 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time we were faced with the situation : do we continue or block the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the defend@@ ants told in the B@@ aker &apos;s B@@ aker of the Finance Office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his colleague and co @-@ defend@@ ant , he then decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , laid down our life insurance policies as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during acceptance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can freely admini@@ ster the money , no debt can be made .
furthermore , in case of a corresponding financial success , the reimbur@@ sement of expenses for expenses has been decided retro@@ spec@@ tively until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the allowance was paid only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus was on the account .
therefore flat and not detail@@ led entries seemed to have appeared , the former ob@@ man explained the events .
the accounts and as@@ par@@ ag@@ us books administered the two defend@@ ants together , said the second accused .
why the withdrawal of the association was not disclosed in detail , the judge asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association did not care in detail for the financial support , it was important to have been only the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when in 2011 , against which a function@@ ary had started investigations into account of abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the club account .
that had been appropri@@ ations , the accused explained .
this securities account ran to the name of the second defend@@ ant and was not known according to the name of the association .
&quot; why ? &quot; the judge wanted to know .
on the other hand , the respon@@ dent did not know any answer for a long time .
then he finally said that he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything of this money , the prosec@@ utor put in the room .
the co @-@ accused was informed that the function@@ ary was justified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claims compensation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why in@@ dem@@ nity ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
wher@@ eu@@ pon the first defend@@ ant declared that he had not agreed with this formulation because the association would never have suffered any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With this you are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore the function@@ ary said he never paid a cent salary , he only calcul@@ ates mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
he charged the association 1,000 euros per month to di@@ ets , but the actual expenditure was much higher , he added .
exact documents for the early years could not show the accused .
these were no longer stored after an operation check , in which everything was judged as correct .
o@@ dom@@ eter also referred to the second accused .
all the trades were made in cash , and he had to drive from his place of residence to the bank to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence , he explained in his statement .
the main hearing will continue on 23 September with the questioning of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard st@@ aps more 30,000 jobs
in addition to the staff cuts that have been ongoing for three years , the computer can disman@@ tle further jobs when spl@@ itting up the company .
the sub@@ stitu@@ tions to the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) have no end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 positions in its corporate customer division .
this will save costs of EUR 2.7 billion ( € 2.4 billion ) , divided the company on Tuesday .
the move will result in a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will be incurred in the fourth quarter .
the div@@ est@@ ment of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed .
at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 associates .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard &apos;s share yiel@@ ded 2.3 percent over the exchange .
the group from California , Pal@@ o Alto , who has grown with printers , is currently spl@@ itting up : the computer and printer business will be bund@@ led this year in a new society - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data store for companies and other services .
both business sectors are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC he@@ el as well as a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services set the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to the latest .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
the proceeds went back in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP rep@@ lies with spl@@ itting up and massive positions on changes in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man re@@ acted late to the fact that customers increasingly buy smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and do more and more business online .
in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans fores@@ ee the reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
however , a direct participation of German soldiers in combat actions in Iraq would mainly be rep@@ u@@ di@@ ated : 54 per cent , on the other hand , responded by appro@@ ving 35 percent .
the fact that other countries fly air strikes against IS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive .
in contrast , 24 per cent are likely to intervene in the conflict .
a collaboration with the Syrian authorities , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , rejected 51 percent of those surv@@ eyed , 20 percent would be responsible for this .
29 per cent could not decide .
car : second press day at the 6@@ 6th IAA
the focus will be on connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and electro@@ mobility up to 27 September .
after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; Mobility connects &quot; officially on Thursday .
the general public can visit the IAA from Saturday .
like two years ago , the organisers of the V@@ DA Auto @-@ Association anticipate around 900@@ ,000 visitors .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence in the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police took refuge in the Serbian border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and the water @-@ laun@@ cher against several hundred raised refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it a police line had formed and behind the polic@@ emen was a water @-@ laun@@ cher ready .
40 to 50 refugees began throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially set up pe@@ pper@@ mint .
the police then used tear gas .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
in this way the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now withdrawn .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees put their bags together and suffered under breath .
the press officers of the Serbian police also suffered injuries through the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve Bank
the world is watching when the US central bank is coming together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday to make the most important decision whether interest has been raised for the first time for almost a decade or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , which was last week of view that the F@@ ed would do so , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates at the current level will last from 0 to 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historic event because it has been seven years since F@@ ed put interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Managing Director at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is on a relatively good level of power , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ru@@ sty outlook on global circumstances .
it warned the markets to adapt to an increase , but the signs suggest that the chances of such a move are good .
the decision is to be announced at 8 : 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death wag@@ ons at Delta State University left exc@@ uses
after the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues on the day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; he could make it impossible , &quot; said the authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor of ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said he shot someone and killed someone .
lamb said to the staff of the emergency call centre that police had to send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b anybody &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but will probably be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give it .
lamb did not give any explanation for its shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb 45 , who said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could reverse it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a history professor before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when police officers surrounded him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday that Lamb had believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was created by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that she was married for about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ er had a daughter who is 19 and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ sh was her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was working online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ sh , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les said
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that Lamb had called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He is not going to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen pick him up on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later that night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
lamb was awarded a Doc@@ torate in Spring 2015 from the Delta State University , as his life lau can be found on the university &apos;s website .
stars who have lost their lucky charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had a few st@@ res@@ sive years .
in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer .
the actor allegedly tried to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession .
all this certainly calls for its tribute .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa is expanding the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large Group restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organisation .
150 of the around 1,000 executives around the world will cost the Group restructuring costs .
however , there are new negotiations with the pilot trade union .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the low @-@ cost Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment was a contribution of approximately € 500 million a year from cost and earnings syner@@ gies , divided the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa is no longer a member of the Executive Board for the passenger business .
the cheap airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
in the future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the management board of chief Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
so far , the organization of the 120 000 employee company was complex .
the airlines operate under the roof of the Passage airline group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the collective conflict with the cockpit agreement Cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations will be resum@@ ed following the strike on this Thursday .
this was shared by the union .
the theme of the talks is to be the retirement plan for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in one year , the cockpit wants to result in a forecast result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as quickly as possible to load @-@ bearing results . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between trade union and airline led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; background is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spar@@ ing concept next to the transitional provision of the pilots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa moves to the Group &apos;s own budget line Eu@@ row@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; under the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ ning in the South &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; there are paintings by Le@@ ena Krü@@ ger at Künst@@ l@@ erhaus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Finn@@ in , based in Göttingen for a long time , has compiled a selection of tit@@ ular works for the White Hall of the House , which anim@@ ate their viewers to embar@@ k on a journey .
Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United cannot play for months because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered from Manchester &apos;s Champions League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven a double frac@@ ture of his right leg .
while this brought the left def@@ ensi@@ sts to tears and exclude him for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w broke into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being brought to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and lies in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps one day later and operated on in Manchester .
it &apos;s horrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , it &apos;s very hard and then fantastic , and then that happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture then it takes six months and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno was happy to be escaped from a Red Card and the im@@ position of an El@@ f@@ lown .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , did not pen@@ alize the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbitr@@ ator was wrong .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an el@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a tweet at Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
referring to this : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the PS@@ V &apos;s defeat
with the European Championship in France , the UK Defender has an additional incentive to recover until the coming June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player with this kind of injury leaves the place , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to violate any opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a broken leg when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ As Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very hard because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear it is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball going in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ der by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron is better acquainted with The Lor@@ ax ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t be long before you know it almost mem@@ orized .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a child care provider to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister decided on The Lor@@ ax , the en@@ vi@@ ro@@ ment of Dr. Se@@ uss in 1971 .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the Super@@ Camp@@ s website , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children because it always seems to give a picture or message we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the story of the book , instead re@@ prints a summary of the 2012 film version , adding new characters and details to expand the rather short original text .
&quot; in the middle of the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , by listening . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and died in 1991 , however completely unknown .
as if that were not suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly read like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he agrees to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so familiar with the story of the book . here , an un@@ named boy hears , like the local environment , rav@@ aged by the cov@@ eting Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , sle@@ az@@ y being , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times consec@@ u@@ tively to a child .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text probably came from Camer@@ ons &apos;s electoral college .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but gave no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened with the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult
to meet Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , there is no repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat on my card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would not exclude a down@@ turn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site might be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the batch setting , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball , Mos@@ ques Ali developed as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he is an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack .
this information : Adam Ly@@ th dies from the England test @-@ cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th , of course , is difficult for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
in his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but tough reality is that cri@@ cket players are oriented to results .
there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said that - players are their own best sel@@ ections .
long ago , one would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate .
if he hopefully turns out further sales for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss commen@@ ded his attitude , even if he did not perform so good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team @-@ man .
the question of how much time a test drummer will get to put his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first sat down in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in maximum form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales came in , and he is a drummer , whom I highly recommend .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends , of course , on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of suggest@@ ing mos@@ ques beside Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler and receive four qui@@ cks , emerged , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a devil @-@ fan of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ ques might not have done his job for his county of Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared in 2001 as an op@@ ener .
he has made three hundred runs straight away and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari arrives in the cad@@ re as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited use with him , he has impressed me very much as a young man .
people may see its statistics - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew , England has made a few wise additions to the training station .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ ede , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a masterpiece coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences as he played in all the conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood arrives for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the dressing room even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .
Coll@@ i &apos;s te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that .
some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not taken lightly .
the Bre@@ x@@ it ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit of the UK from the EU ) could gain access to Zul@@ u if the economy gets into a sl@@ um@@ ber by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ pron@@ oun@@ ce@@ able ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to hold Britain in the EU will go deeper every day , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n becomes the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which viol@@ ently tread down on Tuesday due to Europe .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at re@@ port@@ edly said that some member states are so deeply involved in various crises , as the EU is now and not always on its own fault , Britain itself created agenda with split concessions and disturbing contract changes that they usually do not want to be satisfied .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it would not even like it if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , who wishes a UK looking outside in the EU tent - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and suggests that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care if we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as it happened in the exc@@ essively long per@@ sever@@ ing like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande is looking back on his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
it is also a da@@ zz@@ ling power .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right @-@ wing government , Spain a left .
it is hard to imagine that they will break a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s withdrawal from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
that &apos;s why some such ministers may even deliberately not plan helpful comments , all in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process susp@@ ects my friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and what EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press , but not that they were not supported by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can remember Boris Johnson , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opport@@ uni@@ sts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who has made a name for itself as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU straight ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , phone @-@ h@@ acking foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ nationals who own most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about them , but found that when you sit in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , you better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of becoming his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had put the principle on the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor to him .
the press has never forgiven .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly tap on his back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he had no time to waste for me - seems in danger to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 1980s , a mistake at that time and today .
it may take but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe is - I express it friendly - in development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ dy@@ e trend and the wild sign of Tor@@ ey Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can say yes to everyone Yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week said when the boy sc@@ outs fought in him , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
the struggle for Hil@@ ar@@ ys was even more attractive .
but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ ett &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and dep@@ u@@ ties after all reports at their convention on Monday evening .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - keep in mind that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it &apos;s right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe , which allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks for sure .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities to EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite claim economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to leave - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try , in all , to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin fail to wa@@ ver political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make concessions to the British if everything can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military service in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , what I was reminded at the start on Monday of something that called itself British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise report from Public Health UK via e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than cigarette smoking created from a meeting of 12 people , some with connections to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) adopted Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinarily win@@ dy basis &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on which he justified his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two further researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor for European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that the claim of P@@ he that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were called to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( MC@@ DA ) to demonstrate their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the outcomes of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed references from BA@@ T to Public Health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting announced to receive funding from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not funding which he received after reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International added .
the reasons for selecting the members of the committee will not be delivered , but this includes several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also include a sector finance in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the session also took part in the P@@ he &apos;s tobacco management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ is@@ cated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products at most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or limitations will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been used as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prof. Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he said that the alleg@@ ations of BM@@ J had already been responded to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than cigarette smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence shows and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative risks compared to tobacco .
nearly 80@@ ,000 people annually die of a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking does not cost the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the clear presentation of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC should give up the East calendar , says former head of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC was supposed to stop sending programs like East@@ ender and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give her right arm &quot; for hit shows such as the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he critici@@ zed the BBC that they are public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and tran@@ smit@@ ters like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 without any success to get in touch with the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC applications are commissioned or broad@@ cast@@ ed , which would also be clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee as part of his investigation on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , what I don &apos;t think for a good idea in the medium or long term , one should at least focus on its production on programs that others do not do or commissioned .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve as wide support as possible for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , of course it &apos;s non@@ sense .
Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax financing programs that could also be funded without subsidies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ er@@ ner is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to see how this should be public television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular programmes are what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , presented in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows how to sell shows such as East@@ enders .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C4 , where quite the audience can &apos;t compete , but they can argue when they go on their seem@@ ing missions to justify four billion pounds of broadcasting , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all of these obsc@@ ure programs nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
Johnson said to the committee on the broadcasting fee : &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions that can get the best value .
of course we all think we all think that for 150 £ a year there is a great value here , but for people who are for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me if this is true because they do not consume much from the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check its Rei@@ thi@@ an mission &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to inform , train and maintain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example of the public television channels in Australia and Canada to &quot; inform , enligh@@ ten and enter@@ tain . &quot;
to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with the commercial channels alli@@ ances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetic &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound impulses .
scientists have raised worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment when they are be@@ amed with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by switching on mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react on ultrasound waves .
more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetic , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people for the treatment of symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
th@@ read@@ worms generally do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic air bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worms .
the sound waves effect the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified worms that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons wear TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applying ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ ves@@ icles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetic , a ground @-@ breaking tool that allows scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetic could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that needs to be sent down to the desired place in the brain on an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin producing cells , he added .

&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP Creative Director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that was around the advertising for the Ce@@ L - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic tender corporate advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the blu@@ ep@@ r@@ ints with bright colors and animation it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us to raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture instruments at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Am@@ nesty International . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we need now is an intervention of the British government and the guarantee that torture instruments are not illeg@@ ally tra@@ ded on our door@@ step . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the most creative art around the ce@@ ase@@ fire comes from the area within EX@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors give fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for life in student resi@@ dences
eleven years ago I was a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those whom I have anger@@ ed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I &apos;ve learned can be disti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entry into student residence ranges from slightly nerve @-@ wra@@ cking to absolutely sc@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to che@@ at : people tell where you get , whether and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ ax , where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like unlike those with whom you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people go .
people often turn into drinks reception , film night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people dress themselves and dress their under@@ wear .
referring to this : don &apos;t remember to start with a relationship at university
intro@@ vert will receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences are a space @-@ to @-@ space bum@@ ble@@ bee culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student of convi@@ vi@@ ality is exhausted - sending him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos anchor : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw a few things .
close friendship through baking .
since you start the university at the height of the back man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I gave you something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain themselves and eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent bakery .
poorly mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat make people sleeping when kno@@ cking .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student dwell@@ ings .
of course , the cla@@ ws of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea as well ?
check this with the milk @-@ owner .
the chances are good that they say to use themselves , even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , this is annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it more balanced as my room@@ mate , who added a fl@@ ush@@ ing agent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
it is not only about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people sitting in the glass house in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb .
a girl in my hall asked her neighbors if they had something to make drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more lu@@ ke@@ warm music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before they left their own music , shut their door and went to their three @-@ hour test .
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would accidentally move into the same residence ?
conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be very embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , take care of her , separate herself and then see her every day and perhaps witness how she treats all common friends to him ?
of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot fellow @-@ inhabit@@ ant is definitely not your future wife , try at least to speak to your abdom@@ en a little reason .
at the exciting moment when you notice that someone has his keys in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an ul@@ cer and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good punch is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but never ch@@ ew someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then place in the freezer - but t@@ ack away your possessions on the ceiling not more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single @-@ educ@@ ators , low @-@ income ear@@ ners
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner is building row houses for people who don &apos;t have much money in the Central Fran@@ con@@ ian corner @-@ valley .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living room , but also the single mother and the low @-@ ear@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show you how you can build well today and well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are rush@@ ing to the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how rapidly cheaper living space can be created : he builds terra@@ ced houses for refugees in a project .
Mr Gil@@ lis , many refugees are rush@@ ing to the housing market .
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people remain here to a great extent here .
in view of the flow of refugees we need enough living space in the next few decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ story town@@ house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a row house needs least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if you put people in blocks of flats .
each of the six houses that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for each four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace again , I go back .
then the houses can easily be changed according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
Gil@@ bert : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 euros , without land .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction lasted six months .
this is appropriate .
do the building regulations have complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ bert : I have correctly gone through my project .
especially complicated is the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the regulation Ord@@ in@@ ance .
gr@@ un@@ chy .
it is still subordin@@ ated who creates three apartments in a row house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities there is no place for this .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced project ?
Gil@@ bert : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
which is definitely not true .
but do not tigh@@ ten the competitive struggle for affordable apartments ?
Gil@@ bert : true , we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but we have built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need housing .
not only refugees , but also the single mother or the low @-@ ear@@ ner .
I show you how you can build still cheap and well today .
that is what it is all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple Update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setup app , typing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it &apos;s ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install .
some have encountered problems after installation , as they get an error message telling us that the &quot; update &quot; is missing .
to circum@@ vent the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean clearing apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely to do so by stream@@ lining the update . similarly , it will be easier to do so if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worth making sure your cell phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone may switch mid@@ way and this could lead to a demo@@ lition of the update .

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
in the fight for the championship title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton , N@@ ico Ros@@ berg only knows a motto : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup Championship pointed out ahead of the start into the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; founded three months ago has added another member in its ranks so the membership number increased to 19 players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the Federal Cross of Mer@@ it 1st Class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation made by Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot afford to pay the membership fee .
youth work and talent research should also be pushed forward .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wants the membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; as an expression of his connection with the spa town .
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro seeks direct contact
the Sal@@ u@@ dis and the elderly centre Anton@@ ist joined together under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new point of contact at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg Square .
in addition to consultations , one can also take part in courses there .
the social foundation takes it down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
from now on , directly next to the purchase market , sen@@ iors and advis@@ ors receive information on questions such as health insurance or health care insurance services .
for years now , with our ambul@@ ant care service , we have established that often car@@ egi@@ vers are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , many services of the insurance companies are not in@@ frequently used because the complexity of insurance companies is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new manager Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ ist and the civil hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this purpose the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore it is possible to use additional offers such as tor@@ so prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other perfectly .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; explained Heike R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
both business leaders are seeing the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre especially in the demographic transition .
this necess@@ it@@ ates a good decentr@@ alised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
moreover , the mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ able get @-@ together . &quot;
this makes the social foundation a big contribution for sen@@ iors to be able to live independently and well in their familiar surroundings .
the Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ Bureau is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;

men beating a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , around 23.@@ 45 o &apos;clock , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one from the group , a 17 @-@ year old Afgh@@ an , followed after data from the police to his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft fuel station .
there were also three persons on the premises of the gas station .
one of these men now scre@@ amed the young man and hit his face with his fist .
the victim suffered a nose of nose and ble@@ ed strongly out of the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he left his victim first .
the injured young man was brought home from his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car up to their apartment , and demonstr@@ atively passed by there demonstr@@ atively .
when you couldn &apos;t see the vehicle any more , the injured went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was again attacked by the ra@@ cket and another male member .
with the help of a pole it was checked on the face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim .
the injured person had to be hospit@@ alized for medical treatment .
so far only a vag@@ ue perpetr@@ ator description is available .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters in size .
the second ra@@ cket was about 1.@@ 65 m tall and was dressed with jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police ask witnesses and instructions to report under the telephone number 0@@ 6@@ 18@@ 1 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank Müller assumes office in the field and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) assume the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ est@@ ausen .
there are also Deputy Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ ek@@ Kab@@ ul .
in many places in the country doctors are missing - A@@ sen@@ dorf on the other hand is lucky : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice in the field on October 1st .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still at the side of his successor in the coming months .
after a re@@ building phase , Müller re@@ opened its practice on 12 October , until then it inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was symp@@ a@@ thetic to the first glance when the Fel@@ est@@ aus@@ ens met Frank Müller and his wife , Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who are currently completing their specialist training at the Ver@@ den Hospital and also wants to enter into practice this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mil@@ ler would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far , I just called her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Müller pleased the idea to operate their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to meet and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage he also sees to be his own boss .
and so it was agreed that the mil@@ ler bought the house with practice .
however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller also grew up there , his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed chief emergency doctor in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is involved in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from September 19 , the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ stand@@ ausen is working as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ acional ) has specialised in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Müll@@ ers , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as a household doctor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the conversion the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and load EC@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
the ED@@ V is also completely renewed .
a total of 50@@ 000 Euros will be donated by the land@@ owner as part of a funding programme of 25@@ 000 Euros and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and glad we are , that the practice will continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sam@@ t@@ eller tut@@ or Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , some 2000 patients come to the field of field breaks every quarter , in northern Germany there are about 500 patients .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another doctor &apos;s office .
a positive side effect of the practical tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ est@@ ausen , the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor would have found it , it would have gone too .
if you visit Müll@@ ers &apos;s consultation hour , inci@@ dentally , you continue to look especially in familiar faces : take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the fel@@ lows .
with their departure in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all the doctors have practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ alling Ur@@ sel Fel@@ est@@ ausen sm@@ iles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a little sad@@ ness she already senses after a long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients a lot more often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the host . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pressed gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we let the refugees go through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also ramp@@ ed up at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior , Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls at the Hungarian border are maintained parallel to this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still clear that anyone who wants to submit a asylum application can do this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people must know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would continue to travel to Austria and Germany and to establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
however , this interior minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already severely controlled as the border of the Schengen area .
as Minister @-@ Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ians want to avoid borders for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fill in his obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried to arrive in eastern Croatia on the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid registration .
she was able to pick up the Croatian police in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , police vehicles are constantly meeting with new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mainly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are also in use .
in the coming days his country will be counting around 4000 refugees , &quot; said the Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian Serbian border that had previously brought immigrants to the Hungarian border were diver@@ ted towards Croatia , meeting Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Belgrade Government , however , denied that it was to instruc@@ t people to adopt certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can neither , nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , in the morning , a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were all night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border that was about 500 kilometres away from Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could in fact lead to a shift of the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west @-@ west route .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive border control options &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not mention details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we carry out strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been hearing this since 2007 , the EU partners have since carried out a good testimony to the country , which concerns the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side there are still about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media reports , they had spent the night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked .
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Minister of the Interior N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to soo@@ the Wednesday morning with a local evi@@ ction in Hor@@ gos : he kept the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for premature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not be a very high number of refugee figures at this time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , private Hungarian refugees have already started distributing maps on which alternative routes are drawn by Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .

Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok should have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminal who has been accused of providing insight into un@@ published financial statements and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the captured information , insi@@ der businesses should have been made on the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched to the investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the SE@@ C message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 additional accused in the case continued .
most of the defend@@ ants are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators are said to have acted on both the US and Eastern Europe .

puls@@ ating , pr@@ es life with wonderful autumn sunshine and in it four big tablets each with the heading &quot; Before I die I want .... &quot;
with this action , the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid drew attention to its 20th anniversary and is faced with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among men , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Aid is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and discussions as well as the volunteers .
while a p@@ asser @-@ by spontaneously takes up the chal@@ k and reads the sentence about &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; stop the war , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; do not long suffer , &quot; others are short , read , say sentences like &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and then go on .
there are always little discussions about the action in themselves , about life , dealing with dying again and again .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I realise that at some point the end comes to this world , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the de@@ ac@@ onal work Mannheim , which is jointly with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband wear@@ er of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , this public action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the fact that not everyone wants to communicate on the boards is understandable , but finally it is a very personal thing .
the subject of death and death is still afflicted with tab@@ oos , such as the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed much to the opening up of people .
an assessment that An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid shares .
the funeral and mourning companion belong to the volunteers of the first hour .
confronted by personal experience with the topic , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce sought to appeal to volunteers by calling , she was immediately reported and was involved in the formation in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the hos@@ pi@@ ce Sankt Vincent .
they are all carefully trained .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid tries to deal well with her task and experiences and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another war@@ p , consider it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of out@@ patient ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free and con@@ fession@@ al .
the financial support of health insurance funds and donations from relatives and associations allows the training as well as training and supervision of the death and mourning companion .
training courses for new employees are offered every two years .
the tablets described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Protestant church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) .
other personal wishes can also be recorded on postcards .

the company also said that it plans to hire some 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell over 2.5 percent in pre @-@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to make a profit between $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the fiscal year ending in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast .
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower view comes in spite of price increases , which are an average of 4.@@ 9 percent and effective on 4 January and despite a higher surcharge for body transport of heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result will increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and growth in online retail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yields solid earnings if you consider the weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , which plans to employ 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , approximately the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex deposited € 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just below $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which predicted twelve analysts from Z@@ acks Investment Research .
sales increased by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of these inter@@ rog@@ ated analysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has seen a decline in international pri@@ ori@@ tis@@ ation shipping , which boo@@ sted sales in its express shipping unit .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter sales increased by 29 per cent during the sales of the body , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self insurance .
the express unit reported higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result decreased because of higher labor costs in the freight business .
in the after@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 US $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .
on Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most anticipated conference in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time to lift the body for the first time for almost a decade .
a mur@@ al of the United States is im@@ pending about them at the end of the ren@@ ounced , two @-@ story residence hall .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
the central bank has a double order from Congress : maxim@@ ising US employment and prices stable here .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict them . it is announced on Thursday that the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented stimulus through the short @-@ term interest rate attached to zero since the end of 2008 .
although most of the economy &apos;s data show that it is growing soli@@ dly , recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets could frigh@@ ten the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to increase this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it only by a quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they can observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise interest rates , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which insur@@ es itself to the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase in interest this week .
the financial markets , however , expect the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator , which shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this suggests a drop in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts reduce the blow by promising that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial average j@@ umped by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16.@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed policy maintains the set this week , said John Lon@@ sky , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , she should go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that interest increase would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
a month ago , F@@ ed seemed well on the way to increase the rate by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that in this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , it would expect more economic progress to increase the sentence .
although job creation slow@@ ed in August , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual budget of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can deal with higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics .
but the financial markets around the world met at the end of last month after China had depreci@@ ated its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial average value fell by more than 16 % in May when investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would cur@@ b global growth .
the market recovered slightly this month , while the Dow is now around 10 % below the pole of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation when interest is to be increased .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the past few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US central bank .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the effects on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be involved in decision @-@ making technically .
but in the end the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the mere hint of the former director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; close &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their monetary expansion caused confusion around the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined can be expected by the F@@ ed representatives that they not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management by En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , re@@ marked this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that are apparently not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ ner , member of the Federal Open Market Committee , committed to increasing interest rate , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia helped the F@@ ed to reduce its interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited det@@ ectable impacts on growth in the US &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Lack@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later , the F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability to the first place only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse , &quot; said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest rate .
the recent tur@@ mo@@ il does not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I certainly don &apos;t want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest because the markets are upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until it is changed I don &apos;t think it should be ahead of time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little Life Aid for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
to give you a warm welcome does not go without the commitment of countless volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
they belong to Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still likes to teach with her 74 lic@@ ences .
every Thursday she is doing it in the asylum seekers home at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
there she helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German .
of course , it is quite different from a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast @-@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organisation SP@@ RS attempts to educ@@ ate women in a sho@@ cking way how important good diet is during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck breasts that are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research indicates that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet in pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ried sports hall
the municipal council of Bern@@ ried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million Euro @-@ expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the plans for the long @-@ awa@@ ited Turn@@ halle building at St. Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the most recent municipal council meeting , the completed building application was unanim@@ ously secured without major discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; previously , among other things , the committee had decided on an application for an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the applicable construction plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was about permission for a special form concerning the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ centered first and roof top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be built . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; background of the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar installations : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this brings us together a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it turned again around the roof @-@ tilt , which for energetic reasons - other than the development plan stipul@@ ates - should lie below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the construction plan for the roof til@@ ting permits no &quot; exceptions , &quot; whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der Municipal Council is generally more restric@@ tive in the case of proposals for liberation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is not a recurring project when it comes to rever@@ ber@@ ation : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hall construction at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
around 2.3 million Euros are calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected by the support of school and Brei@@ ten@@ sport@@ sponsor@@ ships .
in the next process step , the building application for the 18 x 36 @-@ meter hall is now presented to the District Office for testing .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital is planned to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of staff move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
these are the start@@ ling plans of the hospital &apos;s hospital , the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß asser@@ ted .
however , a decision on this will be met by the Supervisory Board and the meeting will be held on Wednesday , 23 September .
if plans were to be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should go to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the remaining internal station .
the rooms are available .
employees who do not go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees are informed of the plans .
the change was initiated by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year and is now changing to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
on the question of who to succeed , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take the lead from October 1 and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a spread of the offer in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in gastro@@ enter@@ ologic diseases on the In@@ ner ward .
over the next two years , when the Supervisory Board agrees to agree to both houses , Fischer and his team should lead both houses until the next year the former hospital of the pop@@ lar , which has more than 35 beds , is to be finally closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the county has planned this for 2018 , when the current refurb@@ ishment at Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is completed .
country coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the Federal Council , will be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what I close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say that there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present , there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a day @-@ psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fischer of the Qu@@ asi move to the Le@@ ch , who was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positively and very intel@@ li@@ gible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has not been given a real perspective for the house where fisher@@ man has been working as chief physician for more than 30 years .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has repeatedly been threatened by closure in recent decades , departments have been closed , such as surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .
the hand b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar @-@ Straße are required tonight ( 20.@@ 15 o &apos;clock ) at the Berg@@ isches HC .
although the stand@@ ings leader of the Bundes@@ liga are the clear favourite in Wuppertal , there is no reason for arrogan@@ ce .
during the last season , the Bad@@ ener picked up a painful defeat at the Bh@@ c and made some good results there .
Jag@@ ur accident with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the aber@@ ration on a maize field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ kreis Witt@@ enberg ) several hunters were in action , as the police announced .
after a firing a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
it was unclear how exactly this happened to the accident .
the criminal police determined .
missing 16 @-@ year old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violence crimes
a suspect has led the police to the corp@@ se of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old who had been missing since Saturday from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
in the inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their corp@@ se was thrown into a canal in Rock@@ hausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who is missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to violence .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ hausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office and the police in wed@@ n@@ esday .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old arrested on Tuesday evening is also considered to be a suspect , who in fact admitted the statement and conducted the investigation into the discovery site of the corp@@ se .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home as agreed upon the eve of a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ hausen .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first stum@@ bled upon the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
in the case of inter@@ rog@@ ations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tances of the missing persons , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police into a channel in Rock@@ hausen , where the body was found .
according to the authorities , the det@@ ain@@ ee admitted to the police station that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was killed and the corp@@ se was placed in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the port fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him under cover .
the further investigation is intended to shed light on the circum@@ stanti@@ al circumstances of the act .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of apartment gaps
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for affordable pen@@ cils .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction is facing a challenge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the incoming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that has already been over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
to meet demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison : this year , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units will be completed in Germany .
this means that 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in a first @-@ time accommodation .
many then stum@@ ble onto the housing market and join the long queu@@ es in front of the apartment rentals .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , less than half of all asylum seekers have lived in the last year for rent .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees .
the study also makes considerable om@@ is@@ sions in the apartment building policy of recent years .
Germany is shooting an apartment deficit that will grow from year to year .
currently some 77@@ ,000 living units were missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , compla@@ ins Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals therefore lived in large cities in need of flat share rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults stayed longer in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the F@@ lau@@ te in the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has sun@@ k again for the first time in recent years .
in order to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; Sozial@@ er Wohnungs@@ bau &quot; proposes a new start .
new incentives should revi@@ ve the social housing construction .
this could be om@@ itted on the purchase tax and the base tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed apartments will be suspended for a limited time .
in addition , attractive fiscal amor@@ tis@@ ation options are necessary according to the Alliance .
the funding programme for refugee shel@@ ters from the state bank Kf@@ W is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the available EUR 300 million had already been retri@@ eved on Monday evening at 18@@ 4 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia align Cor@@ ridor
there is practically no transit to Hungary anymore , since more and more refugees choose the way over Croatia .
Zagreb is announ@@ cing its transit via Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia about the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have spoken to the Sloven@@ ian Minister of the Interior , and if necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border de@@ mar@@ cation , hundreds of refugees moved to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people have crossed the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian television station RT@@ L .
Hungary had closed its border to refugees on the day before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws , which came into force on the same day , virtually eliminates the need for ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic explained : &quot; they can travel through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
but there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
Croatian police arrested the first refugees at the border of Serbia in the morning to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia .
most media reports have been reported from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came to the Serbian border town of S@@ id with both the bus and the taxis .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not come across borders .
this is where the border strip contains other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 90@@ s .
mine clear@@ ers should now quickly create a safe passage .
however , after the closure of the border , there are hardly any more refugees to Hungary .
on Tuesday , the police numbered 3@@ 66 .
shortly before the end of the gate on Monday , there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws categ@@ ori@@ ze the overcoming and damage of the border fence as a crime .
35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated in Sz@@ eg@@ ed in the south @-@ Hungary border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the condemned threatened prison sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; transit zones &quot; established on the border , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning 40 refugees had stopped there .
in practice , however , no one has a chance to grant asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; before the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , only a few hundred refugees gathered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected garbage that tens of thousands of people had left at the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
locking grids were disman@@ tled and one of the reception centres in the border area was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to comment on the goal of this reconstruction .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria only reaches a few refugees .
the country also reinforced its border controls .
but the 20,000 migrants still remained in the country according to government instructions .
in Salzburg about 1400 people wait for the continuation of the journey to Germany .
train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the instruction of German authorities .
in Frei@@ lass@@ ing , smaller groups of refugees met regularly .
mayor drove &quot; ge@@ str@@ and@@ ete &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy after the Bridge Festival on Sunday , when ten people were standing with travel agents at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to take the train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly dis@@ continued rail transport with Austria on Sunday , however , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s conclusion , &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the rocks along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border to the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
prior to that , we have only sol@@ dered the un@@ expect@@ edly guests , with snack and drinks .
we just said we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was self @-@ evident for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
one man did not let it take a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that made us very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers on Sunday evening had switched from an ICE into a regional train towards Passa@@ u , in order to try it after the short notice that the railway traffic was set to Germany , but still to try over the border .
however , the regional train was put off in front of the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest linked with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , on the day before a two @-@ brid@@ ging run sporting - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends further tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke to immediately establish structures in order to ensure humanity , our chan@@ cell@@ or has officially and openly moved the position of the Hungarian government into the sphere of national socialism .
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now faced with cha@@ otic conditions in the bor@@ der@@ lands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the refugees will have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pro@@ mis@@ ed Land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge to produce decent conditions for asylum seekers in the face of the ongoing refugee streams and the coming winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter@@ proof lod@@ gings
Konrad has all hands full with the provision of refugees .
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word has weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to set quarters for thousands of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chaos at the first @-@ time reception centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already taken a grip on Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported on his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the lodging of the 20,000 refugees that came to Austria on Monday was without a great vor@@ tex , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; masterpiece &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad counts with a demand of 85@@ ,000 quarters in the year @-@ round year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 units have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to provide the federal states , 15,000 of them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without soil , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already had talks with the Gover@@ nor .
they would have assured him to create quarters for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria it works well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator puts great expectations also into the ORF campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Help like us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are vac@@ ant in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier critici@@ zed the standards for placing as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , it could not be that the accommodation provider had to comply with a certain height of the towel rail or the size of the upper floor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , he is more successful in accommodation , Konrad explains with his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older Lord , whom one does not say without further into the face the fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not cause the Republic to bear any costs , as they themselves explained .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
the own quest for mapping has not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to place a container on the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but apparently there are problems with permission .
Linz calls for a better division
for the time being no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips Arena and Design Center for refugees planning is planning the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as the people concerned can currently be accommodated without these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further locations should be checked for their suit@@ ability .
the city leader critic@@ ises the division of the refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also contribute here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; boundaries are not sealed off &quot;
in a longer telephone call with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , provincial governor Joseph P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday dealt with further action in the refugee issue .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders will not be sealed off .
the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there is now just the corresponding border controls .
there will be no more special moves with refugees to Germany .
however , the protective hunters were brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria now also controls its borders on its borders , is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for P@@ ühr@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; general renovation in the Linz industrial line is officially finished . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the publicly tra@@ ded IT Group S &amp; T is integrated , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; in IT , the smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine investing in the start @-@ up companies of the New shi@@ py@@ ard and later acquiring some of them .
from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - from which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises something : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
from S &amp; T , 1.7 million euros have been invested in the site , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is considered by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square metres of remaining space in the building are already let out , and for a further 40 percent there are inquiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second store in the Arctic
the focus is on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags in the new shop .
in fact Jut@@ ta wanted to get a dog .
this project had to push the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Ti@@ erschutz@@ lig@@ ad@@ orf as soon as possible : after all , she has now grown in the shape of another business district .
in the Fur@@ la shop in front of the shop , where she sells bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes from various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , pur@@ ses from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously it was rebuilt several weeks ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I long thought if I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor for the decision was , among other things , that even the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location , on which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Region of Linz that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who have Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion @-@ interest has put Br@@ eit on her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I like most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why some woman gets into rap@@ ture at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag , the professional lady can &apos;t answer with the last safety .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag adds to every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called investors .
this property also links some to the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ setting .
whether it mani@@ f@@ ests itself in foreign affairs , prov@@ okes repor@@ ters or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office power@@ fully s@@ lows down the election campaign .
and cuts off well .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate city of K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ öhn@@ ende &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a term many in the win@@ emaking village on the wine route . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people in the village of 1200 are related to it over -@@ tens of corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ stadt director Sim@@ one Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the villa@@ gers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter filmed an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous children , including Tr@@ ump and the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , also comes to word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the heart .
indeed , there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to think that Tr@@ ump is &quot; a bit of a big mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
inci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the surrounding area , &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - too High German : the sender , she says .
Tr@@ ump is coming from the village of the don@@ ors .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the foundation stone of the real estate company was first real estate sales in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland for a long time failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he had once been cut off without permission , the director of the Institute of Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared the start of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes distinctive statements of the descend@@ ant .
it had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a bor@@ der@@ land to deter the illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The grand@@ ma was a native Tr@@ ump , the grand@@ son was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement seems to distance the American , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so ab@@ rup@@ tly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pen@@ sion@@ ary Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions how many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters pointed out that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which generally arrived good .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be better if he did not win the election , for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if this is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if those who had sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting subjects than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my President is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe also without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wen@@ dels Movie , for whom Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 Kin@@ o@@ pedestri@@ ans , also in the USA are w@@ aking up the interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper Bavarian town of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the hand of vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 inhabitants village in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing villages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award in the neighbouring country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have at most 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sunrise dominates the reviews , despite the attempts of N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in the Today Show
Charles Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of leadership of the liber@@ als , but there have been no major shifts in today &apos;s reviews .
the N@@ ine breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sunrise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a one @-@ week series of international television broad@@ casts , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Canc@@ un .
this down@@ side of the Executive Board didn &apos;t seem to play a role for Australian TV viewers , since Sunrise recorded 39@@ 7.@@ 000 viewers in the five capitals , compared to the Today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , Today scored a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number lag@@ ged behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , Today has closed the gap to Sunrise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August Today the average reached 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 3@@ 30,000 from Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 passed .
until now , the average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 viewers in September is at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the ex @-@ series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father who decides to settle down with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and easily hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe scored an average of 44@@ 6,000 people .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small win over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire &apos;s Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia posted 5@@ 20,000 spectators on Monday evening and in the second half an hour a full 7@@ 20,000 .
average Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second night of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot seed will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that didn &apos;t manage to over@@ run the Mc@@ Gu@@ ire Show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secrets to be revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ ann@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who gains The Bachelor .
the woman , who finally lands Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was envel@@ oped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked in with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ pit@@ on Fel@@ lows on the day before out of three , you may have accidentally given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips tight to the final on Thursday
all three women are ly@@ rical about why wood is the perfect man and they called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you don &apos;t , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could their answers become a destro@@ yer who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ pit@@ on Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both quick - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from day one .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams energies , I felt they were pretty compatible and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; Je@@ ann@@ ons Fel@@ lows told .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah stands on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that they and Sam Wood are well @-@ suited as a pair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her perspective , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the house last week made it clear that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now pres@@ ump@@ tuous to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when asked who Wood to choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broad@@ cast@@ ed on Wednesday , 7 : 30 p.m. on Wednesday .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the United States - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game when he lost a fight like the Aus@@ sie Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ vert at his first Pun@@ t return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also to the running game after an injury of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies against the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a also strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the match .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by the special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his bel@@ ated catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t that was restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for for his N@@ FL race .
Hay@@ ne left the field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his original debut back then in 2007 , when a passport in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

because of the high numbers of refugees , the free elec@@ tors are calling for the hi@@ ring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria .
at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn cl@@ utter in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ v@@ är@@ ger warned of a severe crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools when there are no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools from collapse , &quot; Ai@@ v@@ är@@ ger said .
&quot; otherwise we will get distor@@ tions in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the Land@@ tag fraction of the Free vot@@ er conven@@ es until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune .
in fact , quite different main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees now also dominates the free vot@@ er meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject asylum will over@@ lay the clo@@ ister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ v@@ är@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as it existed during the wars of Yugoslavia in the 1990 &quot; s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it goes no further , we have to look at the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the free vot@@ er boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to post@@ p@@ one the free elec@@ torate as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is why Ai@@ v@@ ans also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ v@@ är@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W CEO critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need nationwide uniform standards for federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria push@@ es away , others don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more responsive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the state policy in a large @-@ scale city should not fall under the table .
a long lasting torch remains on the agenda : the education policy .
for the new school year , Cultural Minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot test &quot; middle level plus &quot; at 47 grammar schools in which an extension of the gymn@@ asi@@ um middle level will be tested from three to four years - as a result , it will take nine years to finish school .
but that doesn &apos;t go far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand freedom of choice for all the high schools who want this . &quot; &quot; &quot;

4 People killed after polic@@ emen shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , senior district official , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , with some of them throwing stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before she res@@ or@@ ted to rubber bul@@ lets .
20 officers and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets used , of which it is known that they can kill , but which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last one in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern states , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ ras@@ i say that new provinces that are formed within the proposed new constitution would dimin@@ ish their political influence .
there were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent cl@@ ashes since the 10th century .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been governed centrally for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the law@@ makers ha@@ sten@@ ed the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu and officials said that the new constitution could come into effect on Sunday .
construction site planned in the city
the site at the Em@@ den Youth Centre in the Old Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4,000 square meter surface .
a mix of trade , trade and living is planned - but there is still no concrete offer .
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market an area of approximately 4000 square meters in direct proximity to the Youth Centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are ongoing .
it is planned to use the premises for a mixture of trade , commerce and housing .
one is waiting for appropriate offers , it is called by the city .
what investor demand is not yet clear .
no contracts have yet been concluded .
the city Em@@ den had bought a part of the property that is located at the Ring@@ straße / corner Great Street , already a few months ago and the building on it can be torn down .
restaurant H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning for the holiday housing on the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the Investor creates plans for the project for the first time .
some An@@ li@@ eger are still worried - they fear the res@@ elling of their leisure activities
for months it was negotiated , g@@ ag@@ ged , deb@@ ated and drawn behind closed doors .
now there are plans for a new holiday settlement on the small sea near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prospective , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; System Building &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the city development committee of the Em@@ der Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP @-@ faction , who accused the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends went from the system construction management to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said in front of the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ours now .
the ten @-@ to @-@ twelve million euro project has been in discussion for months .
the images and new details on the desired hotel building were generated with violent reactions under sea @-@ land owners who had arrived at the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea and a member of the board of directors of An@@ li@@ eger , P@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be a giant block that over@@ looks all the other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears , like some other project critics , that the traffic would increase significantly by the planned size of the system : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be entire bus dischar@@ ges to make it profitable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , what happens on the well one hect@@ are area of the former restaurant is still open .
nor is there any operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we need to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this still lack@@ ed , the development plans are still variable .

Google launches dou@@ bling donation campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees to over@@ ride the European nations , as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donation call on its blog .
instead of making a manager the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled from Kab@@ ul with her family , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey included many dark rail and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations will be doubled to a value of 5.5 million to goo@@ gle@@ .com / Group @-@ low to $ 11 million .
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many also fled from the war torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery may be helpful for obes@@ e patients .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if obes@@ e obes@@ e people with diabetes live longer than those receiving non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery .
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to nour@@ ish food .
over the years , obesity operations have proven to be efficient for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain measure of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital reported data collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c flu@@ e formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those who underwent this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I remained at 29 for those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments at around the age of 29 .
among those who underwent surgery , 36 % of the diabetes disease was completely dissolved and at 28 % in some cases .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes was completely dissolved in only one percent and in some cases only about two percent .
in addition , the results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the blood glucose levels of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , so the guiding scientist Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared the average results of the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the ga@@ stri@@ plo@@ y group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved larger decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) and ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.@@ 1 % ) and reported rather a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show any survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people who underwent obesity , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study has not shown an advantage for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it would be cal@@ ming for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their physicians should start taking weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long for people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a reverse is really hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story takes place in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is an issue that is increasingly attracting attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly at school , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because it plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the main professional writer grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could place a literary memorial to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East lies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist Guide has called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit in the UK in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford which is dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of the West European countries to the refugee crisis ad@@ mira@@ bly ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised German and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , like true peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we need to think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of force . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 and pointed out that the violent reaction of the US pulled a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my sympathy in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem is non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put on violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four@@ fold increase of intake of hand san@@ iti@@ zer by children over the past 4 years
po@@ ison@@ ous control centers in the US report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve who swal@@ low strong alcohol disinf@@ ect@@ ants , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of proceeds of hand san@@ iti@@ zer in children under 12 years of age reporting the toxic control centres rose from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them are landing in need of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children deliberately drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers allegedly used disinf@@ ect@@ ants with alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; Lop@@ ez said .
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are the ones that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent which are very appealing to children .
hand dis@@ infection products contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in small children , a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison emergency centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 station in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave any si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , then it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who had recently taken four sp@@ lashes from following Stra@@ w@@ berry Du@@ cts as a disinf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was brought to the treatment in an emergency .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice above the threshold , which is considered drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a not@@ ary doctor who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah told her words and wasn &apos;t able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored her at night in a separate children &apos;s hospital on the sign of Hir@@ n trauma , because the girl had fallen through alcohol and had pushed her head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and store hand san@@ iti@@ zer outside the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol pois@@ oning , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were connected to deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing toxic , un@@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was listed as an active substance .
in January three students of the fourth grade in the State of New York planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by putting anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hand san@@ iti@@ zer and ex@@ iled her from her room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police regarded the s@@ worn @-@ out plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; idle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and referred to disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged

as a result , he crashed into the rear of an audi@@ torium with his truck and pushed this vehicle onto a previously standing Ford Fi@@ esta .
the accident involved vehicles caused property damage of around 10,000 euros , the police def@@ ends .

Adam Ro@@ one@@ &apos;s El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time gave Aber@@ deen a tight victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e , so that the D@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between Celtic and Celtic .
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays down talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
there are rum@@ ors of di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glas@@ gow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths spontaneously . he insi@@ sted that he and his team mates were not under increased control , as they were preparing for the confrontation with the Dutch leader of the table .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in the Scottish football bor@@ es Dutch - de Bo@@ er
former R@@ angers &apos; mid @-@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of the Celtic @-@ Games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here talk not only about returning the ran@@ gers .
they speak about Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they &apos;re interested in .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swear Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la accepted that Celtic had to fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent exit from the Champions League , the defeat against ten @-@ man from Aber@@ deen followed , now with five points ahead clearly at the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel that exactly this way - but we have to go on .
we really need Celtic support because it makes the players better .
to stand together is so important .

the Hear@@ ts resulted in 2 : 1 , when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and lost 3 : 2 , but the Red card of the defender was later lifted - the third red card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he stays what he said , and insi@@ sts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not questioned integrity , I have not commented on performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid ty@@ ro@@ ast@@ le
the in@@ cor@@ rigi@@ ble hi@@ bee was instructed after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive texts about Ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the ros@@ eb@@ urn area of Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ ler in March 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the stri@@ ker , and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is certain to say that I don &apos;t return to Ty@@ ler when it does not play for Celtic Glas@@ gow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tann@@ adi@@ ce Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United &apos;s Executive Board still has confidence in the management team to turn things up@@ side down - but admit that the decline must end on the playing field .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the guys back to Tra@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Inn@@ es was glad to &quot; win &quot; against Hamilton . &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team from Aber@@ deen must fight desper@@ ately against Hamilton Ac@@ cies to see a seventh consecutive league victory that brought them a lead of five points in front of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ &apos;s El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is no team that has won everything in poker games or songs that won &apos;t win games of that kind either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it is increasing overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged in the period May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was 5.5 percent higher than the figure of the National Statisti@@ cal Office ( ON@@ S ) .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland dropped by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost a year ago that Scotland took the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements on the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a drop in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
drunk disturbing the drain
because the security guards were unable to satisfy the situation , the staff called the police .
only with the use of pepper spray the officials could take the stur@@ geon into custody .

why I will be witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
a little later , except for late legal action , I will watch a man be put to death .
when it happens and I hope that it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison inj@@ ector .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death .
the invitation took place for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and there are often more applications available than places available , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to 5 .
whoever is chosen will see it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will be next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it , and you get access .
I complain to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she acknowledged that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could have formulated it better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I made .
I don &apos;t want to go into all the details again .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the act .
but I believe there is a strong chance that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death .
man after wet police persecution persu@@ aded to come out of the Cann@@ ing River
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale polic@@ eman was dry when he persu@@ aded the man of the Cann@@ ing River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to susp@@ end the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y waters , only a few meters away from a police officer who tried to &quot; gently persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale were called into Beck@@ en@@ ham &apos;s hous@@ ebo@@ at crash on Tuesday .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them towards Cann@@ ing River .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he tac@@ kled more reliable tactics - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good polic@@ eman is negotiating . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car to the tren@@ ches to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards were trying to spy on him and thre@@ aten to finish racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims Ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he insi@@ sted on the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she had conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai due to a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself in difficult conditions than it was about the positive cob@@ alt plu@@ ck at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he held back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age alleg@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
tonight I will go home and sleep well .
I want to go about a head raised and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be a coach anymore .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously M@@ oo@@ dy had sent the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stall .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when I am asked - and offered him an occupation in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they obviously believe that I am a sc@@ amm@@ ate .
if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , president of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ wan , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should this bring me to the point of view that it becomes personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L have a cow@@ ard@@ ly behavior and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out there that I &apos;m it .
perhaps they must take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say is letting them think about it now .
but I have now arrived at the point where I don &apos;t care , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Train@@ ers &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have been set up with Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt exploration , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching allowed him to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the failed Master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse &apos;s debate , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s against racing rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I must take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees has er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously applied mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was so .
but it was so on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy turns back against ri@@ vals for claims on ring battles
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy den@@ otes critic@@ isms of the rac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ setting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said the refer@@ ee allowed the storm @-@ player &quot; ring@@ fight &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday night .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a barely concealed remark to the Storm team after his team reached the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ li@@ g of his team and said that they were only concentrated on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading trainers in his team gave him a confident voice as it meant that they were worried about being hit by the storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows up again and again - I have not heard Tr@@ ent Robinson said about Batt@@ les when they beat us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our defensive system or techniques all year long . but over the past six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ oma a real focus , and this has provided us with the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and obviously he has a great team to train . he is probably not accustomed to losing , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is funny how this occurs again and again at this time of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wa@@ yne is talking about exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he would take care of a sh@@ it .
but now he has a team that can play and that we watch as exciting , especially his young players at their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play as they can .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are there p@@ auses and not points something exciting ?
for me , it &apos;s the game plans .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase .
the Storm team has released this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday evening in the Pre @-@ fin@@ als at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with $ 200,000 Guarant@@ ee on Drug Ad@@ dress
a man who could possibly have a life @-@ long punishment because of his attempt to get possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and started in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the yacht harbour during the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a possibly life @-@ long punishment for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole quantity and that in the café could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the danger of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of criminal proceedings , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security in common to reach his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he left his austr@@ ali@@ an and his Serbian passport , reported to the police daily and is holding a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : cab ri@@ ps apart
during a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe , a lor@@ ry driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had slow@@ ed down in front of a permanent construction site towards Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment , as the police announced .
the crash @-@ causing cabin &apos;s cab ri@@ pped completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ North was completely closed from six hours to 2 o &apos;clock .
there was a damage of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to l@@ ure ped@@ ophi@@ le to send pictures
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when this fell asleep , logging into an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a number of un@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping ho@@ gg .
she saw it through , found the bewil@@ dering news and immediately al@@ er@@ ted her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; related &quot; web research that used terms for the search for in@@ decent images of children .
Ho@@ gg then asser@@ ted against the officials that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es on the internet , &quot; and then &quot; preten@@ ding to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
the prosec@@ utor , E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on , said to the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be an ad@@ diction , that he was addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people .
he admitted that the search on the computer were done by him , but said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
he said he was sick in the head when he drinks and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was at the trem@@ bling and crying .
she then saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the accused with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused took computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation to speak with girls who looked much younger than he .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty according to the indictment , to have in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year , to have viol@@ ated the conditions on 25 January of this year and not to be published before the court hear@@ ings on 24 March this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defense attorney Gregor S@@ im asked for Ho@@ gg not to appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders because one could argue that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be found in his off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ es the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work .
in this case , Ho@@ gg was granted a security deposit but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings on other cases pending .
he was added to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of the judgment .
hau@@ ling switches to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are being taken up in the German @-@ Austrian border away from the major control points .
many Schle@@ houses left the people on smaller border cross@@ ings from fear of discovery and arrest .
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
more than 1000 refugees have been taken up along the border river Inn in the rural districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they were on foot over bridges and dam onto the German side .
there they are received by federal police and forwarded to the registration .
according to Federal Police information , more refugees met again on Wednesday at the Munich central station in comparison to the beginning of the week .
around 700 people arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 a.m. , a spokes@@ man said in the morning .
after the re @-@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stuttgart : runner from tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expected in the southwest
meteor@@ ologists warn against storms in the southwest from Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area in Western Europe , warm ocean air flows into the country , distributed by the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart .
the powerful low was the prec@@ ursor of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; which was drawn from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in the last days .
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , even up to Thursday morning in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Boden@@ se@@ price with bu@@ cks from 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
on Friday , the sun can be seen again for a longer time .
the mass makes it : every two years the car showers at the IAA show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
in 2015 , the compact cars are particularly popular , which are currently particularly well @-@ selling .
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 per cent of the new registr@@ ations accounted for this segment alone in August , according to the Federal Tax Office ( KBA ) .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public days from September 17 to 27 ) .
this year , many new compact models will be presented between all futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it is part of the brand &apos;s core .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive .
Opel is entering the world &apos;s biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf with a view of 17 650 euros .
the current Astra is priced at 16,@@ 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the Hes@@ si@@ ans offer further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for the first time include three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially just five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Kom@@ bi , which can also be seen at the IAA .
and what about new compact cars next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the trade fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e can be seen exclusively as a five @-@ door in a conventional and sporty GT version .
in the trade , he will arrive at the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan atten@@ u@@ ator wants to find his position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fully adjust@@ s to the design line of the brand .
the base model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the range also includes a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is scheduled for spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not entirely new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 that can be seen at the IAA .
outside , the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n designer laid his hand on the front end : here , the radiator grill was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights are equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ otain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and included for the first time Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play .

the Federal Constitutional Court issued an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee of the legal prison of Te@@ gel , which was housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , in@@ mates are entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells .
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , the persons affected can even hope for money if they were confined in confined spaces only a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
as a result , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful : he was accommodated in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated .
after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer &apos;s data , has now been on free foot@@ ing , has been moved to a larger cell .
due to the un@@ question@@ able detention conditions against the Land of Berlin , his prosec@@ utor &apos;s situation failed .
however , the Constitutional Court uph@@ eld the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al and re@@ mitted the case to the re@@ trial .
they see the man &apos;s dignity viol@@ ated .
court court decides now on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons only a few days of imprisonment for the compensation were decisive , a statement of compensation was given , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation of the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber judgment must now clarify the amount of the money @-@ compensation .
in the past , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners .
thus they only spoke to a det@@ ain@@ ee in April because he was locked in a cell naked .
according to a decision from 2011 , the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet is un@@ dig@@ ni@@ fied .
furthermore , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , who had certified a prisoner in a parallel case in a parallel case in November 2009 .
for three months , the then pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff was accommodated daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also hit the head@@ lines due to missing personnel .
det@@ ain@@ ees are therefore always included 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness is rising , even fights should have occurred due to the ten@@ se situation .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney Office 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of offspring , 19 are expected to fall away in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what comes to Germany ?
according to the Federal Ministry of the Interior , some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to accept one million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following overview shows what is coming to Germany .
according to different progn@@ oses of 350 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Building ) and 400@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) flats are needed annually - and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
the lack of housing is dramatic , but above all for affordable rental objects : annually , 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social dwell@@ ings fall out of the rental price binding , and these particularly favourable apartments will also apply for refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to a billion euros .
this is far too little from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80@@ ,000 social housing annually would have to be built and the federal government would have to invest a funding amount of 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both scientists and Federal Buil@@ ders agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in residential construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can work in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically needed after their qualification to help them get started , critic@@ ised Claudia Walter , Project Manager for Integration and Education at the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial to find employment in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the reception society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Klinge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany , according to Thr@@ ust@@ y , there has been a political turn : from the prohibition of employment for refugees to recognise work .
while there was a ban on employment for asylum seekers of up to five years earlier , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just like the residence obligation to limit asylum seekers to a place of residence .
in the society - also because of the lack of skilled labour - mostly the view has prevailed that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly .
the lack of German knowledge is a major barrier to access to the labour market .
until now there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
studies also show that workplaces are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
for this reason , the structure of networks is the royal road to work integration according to the view of Thr@@ ust@@ hardt .
the Berlin school administration has found that few wing@@ ed parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the dis@@ bur@@ row@@ ned parents it is only very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ noti@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family of the benefits of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the demand for educ@@ ators increases strongly due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of training , for example by allowing more specialised schools .
in the countries , students without knowledge of German will be prepared for classes without German language skills .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , as well as teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ offers from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle no federal state prohibited asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception was Berlin , inner sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his attitude .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; willing to study refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because refugees with a stay reimbur@@ sement or de@@ ple@@ tion do not receive any benefits according to the asylum application law if they begin their studies .
the latter , in principle , do not receive a b@@ af@@ e as they do not fall under the circle of the bene@@ fici@@ aries .
patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be entitled to b@@ af@@ o@@ grams , from 1 January 2016 , this can be shortened to 15 months .
but this funding gap must also be closed , call for Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play an important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many people religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually rec@@ ede to Islam the same rights as the churches have , and the existing state @-@ churches right to develop a new state religion relationship .
it is also important to establish an Islamic welfare association who takes care of the newcom@@ ers in a professional manner .
duties also include duties .
thus the representatives of Islam must agree to clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant certain control options to it .
this also includes the willingness to take heart to religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to escape such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law into Arabic .
integration will in future be much more than today a topic of the whole society .
in this way , the majority society will have to change , and the disman@@ tling of discrimination and rac@@ ism will be more urgent .
as a result of European decisions , Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general equality law since a short decade .
but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U series showed that the police and authorities ignored the rac@@ ist motive systematically .
equal opportunities for all : what Mig@@ rant organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans are calling for a long time and why international agreements such as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism Convention in Germany are committed must become a reality in the coming years if the country should remain peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the good of all .
in general , Germany is in a position to provide medical care to the hitherto expected refugees , says President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as man@@ - power and capacity are concerned , we are creating this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
in order to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery asks all the newcom@@ ers to hand out health cards immediately .
provided services could later be settled with the federal states .
and in the long run it is highly question@@ able to break down so many people with the limited range of services that the asylum seek@@ er performance law fores@@ ees .
apart from that , the doctors make the language barriers most of all possible .
so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has shown that migrants are becoming more aware of their illnesses than other patients .
it is not only in clinics , but also in doctor &apos;s sur@@ geri@@ es that interpreting costs would have to be taken over .
but many refugees would have been helped by more general medical centres in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
among refugee children , for example , there are much more un@@ equal disability , and with the young people it is about HIV enlightenment .
with the partly different diseases , German doctors come to realise their training , &quot; says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite attacks or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not that difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the doctors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fighting &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the refugees may even have a relief in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians have a highly developed educational system , some refugees are even doctors .
in order to be able to practice , they must prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill after estimates by the Federal Institute of Psycho@@ therapy ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
refugee children are particularly vulnerable , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recently published study by the Technical University of Munich demonstrates that every fifth Syrian refugee camp is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
those who are suffering from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffers from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , pal@@ pit@@ ations and fears of death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong shock and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
Mun@@ z declared that the symptoms would be chronic if the symptoms were chronic .
up to now only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , mentally ill asylum seekers in the social offices can submit an application for psycho@@ therapy , but treatment usually lasts several months .
in addition , in the social offices , in most cases , non @-@ skilled workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , &quot; Mun@@ z says .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new staging &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to draw each age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites in the Man@@ ege on the brick , v@@ ases to dream .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and junior chef . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - this is the motto of the current stage production . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family for more than 33 years .
the gift for fan@@ atics is therefore in the blood of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take the people away from their daily boy@@ cot@@ t and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior chef . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with cosm@@ opol@@ itan flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 kilometre tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
awarded the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wit and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of silent films , the Cuban duo wants to easily take in .
ease and ag@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s hearts by storm .
besides numerous salmon @-@ sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the cir@@ cus pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with intuition and arti@@ cular clear@@ ness .
balancing on a ball with the un@@ ic@@ ycle ?
for He Yu@@ an no problem .
snake @-@ men fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascin@@ ates with her mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Steph@@ an@@ ies mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
ab@@ norm@@ alities in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are all too often subject to various animal welfare organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst also takes a stand : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not good for our animals , nor does it go well for us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each stroke unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artist &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are lovingly called , is read by the eyes as far as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to go into the man@@ ege .
so the par@@ amount commandment : good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land P@@ ony stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived together for eight years in a ken@@ nel and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
so there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst ur@@ ges : &quot; no matter if five or 1,@@ 200 people , we always do our best and are with all your heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to your performances from 17 to 20 September daily at 5 pm and 8 pm .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , for the screening at 5@@ pm the prices are reduced .
the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is also open daily from 10 am to 6 pm .
Zimbabwe Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , stepped down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ hurt , but the video of the fall quickly spread across the social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by claims of dep@@ u@@ ties of the opposition , that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them of accompanying Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with Bu@@ ehr@@ onie .
last month they had blocked him and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones , warning them to interfere with Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he told repor@@ ters about Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warns the affected Parliament members that the immunity in parliament ends and as soon as they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25,000 @-@ 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will later split into two listed companies this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and its service business activities .
the expected job reduction will result in a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , &quot; said HP in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , president of HP and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; will be focused on providing so far un@@ paralleled , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; explains the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard to produce electro @-@ equipment and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage man called &quot; the birth place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to manage the return from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this area , based on the belief that closely focused companies perform better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed about Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation is going according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four matches for England , and in view of his story , his participation in the next summer is certainly still uncertain .
the big shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing back during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten your career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that didn &apos;t heal properly .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also acknow@@ le@@ dges , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the study of Premier Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ als in 15@@ 7 league players in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for Arsen@@ al is that they were one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , which recorded most of the vulner@@ ability .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win fighting force , &quot; Wen@@ ger said .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves .
Arsen@@ al will start his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , which means that Ma@@ th@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need it to take a little break @-@ off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign was launched last season . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measuring 3,@@ 2 on the Richter scale .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven by far away hope to lead the association to his first European victory with his management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked at Arsen@@ al .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand , I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
friendship Fest : the comedy show , which gives us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the lack of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now even more desperate than ever before , as suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ aig@@ n Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a w@@ ret@@ ched life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man with the goal to question the culture that prevents men from seeking help if they need them .
friendship is at the heart of the fight to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms found that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery were doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of spiritually healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends first , so that friendship can work .
in the age of communication led through social media , with its focus on style over substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a significant contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even though in reality isolation is domin@@ ating .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was turned up@@ side down .
each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , gle@@ aming through interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments in soccer matches in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can relate to it , even if they often with@@ hold to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of the telephone ministry explained to me : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; my role for listening to people who feel de@@ pressed and at risk of suicide has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us feel often unable to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when one speaks openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer more long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
as much as my objective out@@ si@@ ders status about the phone may help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you come to Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend with the completely re@@ designed scenery to celebrate the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you see someone sitting alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends is sent to Com@@ edy Central from start to finish - the complete 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to break Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ guy Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
in his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , the Maria will meet PS@@ G to drop by Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani continued course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prince Park stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G @-@ player who brought the French master on the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their advance when Cav@@ ani reached a head @-@ goal in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk even in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master , as they not only asp@@ ire to qualify for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a classic game by Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the club with whom he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , cause our opponents troubles and look back relaxed even if there are certain things that we have to perfect over the season , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two other goals scored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris Team after his injury , which in the weekend could hold a 2 : 2 draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First league , but he was stab@@ bed to death in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was called the man who can take PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over last month by Manchester United , and he pointed out why , when he went in to Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind Malm@@ ö defense , before he passed Johan Wil@@ and nicely into the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who hit Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was armed with a five man defense and two deep in the middle field a heavy opponent .
but in addition to a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed away to Kevin Tra@@ pps Center in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in advance .
instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes abandoned himself , with some fla@@ ws and bad degrees , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was spar@@ ed in the first half in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after the restart .
nevertheless he showed much more skill if he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , turning Di Maria into a shooting , which was defle@@ c@@ ted by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an got his sixth place of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished up a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the end result low before replacement player E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi finished a gate in the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , age Har@@ ei@@ de later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then we have played only in the Swedish league , which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualification games are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hats off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
a few years ago , FC Bayern was shortly before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who at that time played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times winner Cup winner , twice champion league winner , twice champion world champion , twice world champion , twice world champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is stunning .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old retired to FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i reveals that he was in Barcelona before the 2008 European Championship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça would sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid has won everything back then , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered also of FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rou@@ man@@ ia wanted to have me . &quot;
remember : in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern .
guar@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this works today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola and I played a great European Championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s playing time was run in 2008 / 2009 with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn , the reds broke out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s triumph at the end .
matt Dam@@ on playing variety in film@@ making
matt Dam@@ on confronted the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown interrup@@ ts the need for alternative perspectives , in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the selected script of the project .
&quot; if we talk about diversity , do it with the cast of the film and not with the cast of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Brown responded by shocked , with offen@@ ded dis@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian fast@@ ened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want people to think about it - who will always be the director - how to treat the figure of the Harmony , &quot; Brown said at first .
the only black person , and she is a groove , which is beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p .
the producer of Dear White People was campaig@@ ning for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing rights to the film . Dam@@ on replied that &quot; in the end her direction &quot; could give us something we do not want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Po@@ oni &apos;s Twitter user expressed his anger over the clip , writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in the room , so he can explain its variety - that &apos;s SO WH@@ ITE that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et deserved more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 songs since its publication .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise rac@@ ist representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
after killing Michael Brown in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement achieved nationwide effect and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against the contents .
in February the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album still matter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black lives , albums still have their mean@@ ings .
more recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation in response to the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or met the Pope is unclear .
&apos; American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowns first champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete who won the American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which has just completed its 7th season , has never experienced a competition participant who could finish all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
to the final task , climbing was part of a 75 foot climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten completed the task within the time with which he was the first ath@@ lete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under shock over the win of the great price of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had been alive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E. over his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he was the first to finish the course , did not receive any prize money .
according to the rules , money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it will be the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , it receives the great rati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he has any gru@@ dge about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac felt the same if they had changed the roles .
America N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
Min@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field .
the T@@ wins don@@ ned a chance to climb within a half of the Houston area for the second American League Wild@@ card Square .
for Detroit , albeit only for an evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word , which was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all wins are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. &apos;s manager , Brad emig@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintains his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and enabled three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw in bull@@ pen each game , and therefore I want to go into the game completely concentrated .
the designated Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was Mart@@ ine@@ z &apos;s first triple hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung the schla@@ gh@@ ol@@ z well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked much better at the bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the back@@ yard at the end of the seventh inning the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon made his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier the Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
har@@ dy survived the wall , the only man with whom he was faced , before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who left the right @-@ handed fil@@ ly Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen into a two @-@ run .
with a pair of runners and the finishing run in the second , Ver@@ hagen introduced the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play .
it was the 27th time in the Major League , 27th time this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit a Double Play
after adding an insurance run at the end of the ninth inside , the Wall created a R@@ BI double against the loser of the tiger Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed , however , st@@ ach S@@ ano at three pit@@ ches for its fifth save .
at the beginning of the game , Detroit was benef@@ iting from a not moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers scored three races in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been removed from the injury list before the game after he had missed more than a month because of a back suffering .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt better when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter first , H@@ ush@@ es gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z made Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z playing a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 success stre@@ ak with the Run@@ ners in the scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right side , managed to run another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , ending the threat .
the tig@@ ers placed in the second one , obtained a one @-@ out double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he didn &apos;t feel very well , but he got the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning before replaced by the reli@@ ever right @-@ handed photographer A.@@ J.@@ Ei@@ ght .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four strokes .
remarks : tiger R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z res@@ ig@@ ned due to a violation of the throwing school .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , who has been on the vulner@@ ability list since mid @-@ August , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP has stri@@ pped Daniel Mor@@ ris from the vulner@@ ability list to launch against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the tiger since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he lack@@ ed since 20 August due to a distortion in the right hip joint .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will finish their series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4,@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ota &apos;s R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees shall perish in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people who arrived there should be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the City of Wiesbaden arrived on Tuesday evening .
it comp@@ utes with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this case over the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily stop there .
they should then be distributed to other municipalities .
in the past ten days alone , there were 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse , who were responsible for the first recording of the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Gie@@ ßen .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls due to the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe the decisive reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he accused the European States of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective displacement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was glad that the cup of military involvement in Germany had passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict comes crashing against our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international assistance to refugees on the ground .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Germany , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Austrian Minister for the Interior , Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , announced on Tuesday evening in the Austrian broad@@ caster ORF , nobody will be sent back to Hungary .
also Germany did not send back refugees to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , that &apos;s so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement that Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been talks between the General Director for Public Security and representatives of Germany .
she did not call concrete figures and pointed out conversations on Wednesday in Berlin .
over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , together with several other EU heads of state and government , requested a special summit next week .
Germany had started on Sunday with border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
next Tuesday ( 22 September ) , the EU interior ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of further 120@@ ,000 refugees on a special meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the strong refugee status in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries in the first recording and distribution of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Con@@ federation will manage this jointly with the countries , announced Merkel on Tuesday evening after almost four hour consultations with the Minister @-@ Pres@@ idents in the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined those people who needed protection , too .
but if you don &apos;t have a lead perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany .
this opinion was strongly divided in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary had closed its 175 @-@ kilometre border to Serbia in the night to Tuesday .
a few hours later , the government announced in Budapest that the border to Romania would be brid@@ ged with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary wanted to prevent smu@@ g@@ gling badges on Romania , Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
in Turkey , in the meantime , thousands of further migrants were making their way to the Greek border .
room probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus
under the ice @-@ dance of Saturn &apos;s En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus , a global ocean sw@@ ells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes researchers from observations of the space probe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore the moon stum@@ bles easily on its orbit around the ring planets .
this movement is only small , but nevertheless too big for a permanently fixed cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a communication from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state of New York ) from Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technical sheet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was known for a long time that there would be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already discovered ice volcan@@ oes at the South Pole of the Satur@@ nian moon in 2006 , sp@@ ying the water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feeding the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed back then .
the expansion of the hidden ocean , however , was not clear .
R@@ ama absent in Munich several weeks
the 1860 München must ren@@ ounce Val@@ det R@@ ama for approximately one month .
an investigation has resulted in an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury at the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , divided the association .
at the beginning of the week , R@@ ama mour@@ ned for pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Munich Lion , the diagnosis means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expected four weeks of forced break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a severe loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we need to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sports Director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view to the potential obligation of a uni@@ denti@@ fied professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a training guest , however , the six@@ ties were initially a defensive man .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at currently has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opportunity to prove his ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tor@@ j@@ äger Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to team training next week after his conc@@ ussion .
the Austrian national player should already enter the running training on Thursday .
in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) Ok@@ ot@@ ie was hurt by a violent collision at the head .
contrary to the first fears , however , he remained without a serious cens@@ orship .

during purchase man@@ goes should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .

the US parcel service U@@ PS offers up to 9@@ 5,000 aid in the US for the Christmas business in the USA .
the company has already started recru@@ iting seasonal workers , U@@ PS announced on Tuesday .
above all drivers are sought .
already last year , U@@ PS increased its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5000 aids .
in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and its competi@@ tor F@@ ed@@ Ex have been taking precau@@ tions since last year to be prepared for the Christmas business .
in 2013 , delayed deliveries had brought the package service to harsh criticism .
first fo@@ eh@@ ner tower , then prominent cold front
in the coming night the F@@ öhn stops in the valleys of the Alps side of the F@@ öhn , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz announced on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and on the night to Thursday the F@@ öhn blows partially with storm strength through the fo@@ eh@@ ner valleys .
after the bo@@ oming on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front that brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a drop in temperature .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a strong south@@ western current .
on the north side of the Alps , the F@@ öhn stops in the night to Wednesday through the valleys .
as a result , the F@@ öhn blows in the bo@@ oming valleys with bends of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partially also with over 100 km / h .
the hair @-@ dryer can penetrate to the adjacent centre @-@ country in some places , and on the mountains , even or@@ cs @-@ gu@@ sts of over 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north at the Wednesday stor@@ my hair dryer for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , moisture begins to st@@ ow at the Alp@@ ens@@ ü@@ d@@ slope .
rain starts here , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , more than 100 litres of rain per square meter must be expected in the south of the Alps in the next 48 hours , this after the last few days already large quantities of rainf@@ all have fallen .
on Thursday morning the air is blowing , as a result a cold front with a strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east is rolling over Switzerland .
along with the cold front the wind fresh@@ ens up strongly to stor@@ my , and temperatures return significantly .
the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees Celsius , on the other hand , on the weekend it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther square in Rome .
in the presence of Mayor Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former .
at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the heart of ancient Rome , right next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the name was proposed by the working community of the Protestant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es for centuries as a minority were often only able to live their faith in hiding .
with the pla@@ za , it becomes visible in a symbolic way that its tradition of the Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered himself a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
at that time he felt the city as a fallen man of sin .
his negative impressions are likely to have reinforced him by historians in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the split of the Western Church with his theses against the decline of the Ab@@ las@@ sh@@ al .
hammer Pain@@ ter invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Old has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which has now appeared with splendid images .
at the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , this can be quite glo@@ omy .
for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subj@@ ectively artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
cycles which focus on topics such as cross paths , pla@@ gues , commandments or fa@@ therhood are born .
this makes him immediately fascinated by several partners : this applies to the Luther Publishing company with its the@@ ological focus as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its emphasis on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has placed himself apart on the basis of painting with the respective Bible passages .
he interpre@@ ts the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Old and translated into current contexts .
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original biblical quotation of Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts to the respective situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ h@@ uter @-@ Orden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the education has been done with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she re@@ members Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work up to bring me to the Lord &apos;s Father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second aim is to bring art back to greater value in the fast @-@ lived period : &quot; today &apos;s perception of visual worlds is marked by advertisement and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is being displaced .
artists have a different mood and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewers to &quot; fall into the pictures , &quot; they let themselves work , discover and sense the power they have : &quot; the picture is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art to be : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
I did not care to completely capture the Bible , but chose the topics that are important to him , including mysterious topics .
&quot; this was not a co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; arose a picture Bible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther Publishing this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( Bibli@@ cal ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas prints - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
start of construction for the BM@@ X railway is approaching
plans were made , place found , company instructed , earth moun@@ ds were model@@ ed for a round course : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X track , it was already over again .
om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration made for dr@@ uss , especially for residents who did not want to tolerate the railway .
so hill tow@@ ed , looking for new place - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval was received in October , and the first com@@ edi@@ atri@@ ate Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will still happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further pause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the work of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B wi@@ dens its commitment to refugees by 2019 , and the Bundes@@ liga cat@@ ches a clear signal on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football responds to the escal@@ ating situation in Germany and ass@@ ures politics its help in tac@@ kling the upcoming problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this for the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t concern me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must interest each individual to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he will discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the chan@@ cell@@ or &apos;s office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mr@@ s Ö@@ z@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and will help .
but the decisive course must put politics forward .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football League has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also some federal govern@@ ors support this program .
already on this weekend , the 36 Prof@@ essors undertake a clear sign when they will carry on the left tri@@ cot @-@ sleeves instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logo ( Her@@ mes ) the im@@ print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ us@@ en Motorsport Director Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matter of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama is going on everyone , nobody can see it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can be soccer @-@ federal , no , we must use our bril@@ liance , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees that have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent signs of the league . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on this Friday the national team of the women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large joint work of German soccer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 licensed clubs have started their own projects in their places is great .
it is just as great that small and small clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and the next year , the association will provide 300@@ ,000 euros for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government .
&quot; the clubs have already called up all the sum for 2015 , &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach reported .
reports : SAP CEO lo@@ oses an eye in case of accident
the board of directors of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
in the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the United States , he fell on a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he &apos;s almost bloo@@ dless , impot@@ ent , then dra@@ gged ki@@ cked out onto the street - he told us this last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could pursue his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we met at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to run the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am full for SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman , Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually oscill@@ ates between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , said the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can do something like this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up once you have fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except fighting ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen weather@@ ed a photograph and explained that he suffered the injury when he was thrown off the wheel .
he therefore comes as little as a spare driver for the two stam@@ mer@@ es Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button in Singapore on the weekend , as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ low lake in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback from Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europa League have definitely been sm@@ ashed .
the national player will also be missing the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga as well in du@@ el with the FK Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot rely on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ck@@ les on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga championship on Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BA@@ B coach left : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the high burden of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ u@@ chel will not only change its stem 11 on the Re@@ us position .
so he announced a change on the goal keeper &apos;s position .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of the Roman citizen novel .
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the world champion .
however , regardless of whether wil@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used in all Europe @-@ League games in the future , however , Tu@@ ck@@ les made an open decision .
with a high probability he will also contest the second game .
Mit@@ ch Re@@ us &apos;s for@@ sche asser@@ tion that the final entry for the BV@@ B in the Europa League has to be the goal , mid @-@ field player Julian Wei@@ gl is understandable : &quot; this is not so wrong with Marco . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants to lead the way for Germany
according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological leader in the transformation of the car .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided to launch a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , envis@@ ages investment in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday in Frankfurt , Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility age &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Frankfurt Motor Show . &quot; &quot; &quot;
automated and connected driving will improve road safety and reduce traffic jams , &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt .
he also wants to discuss the topic with his fellow @-@ colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who come together with representatives of industry at the International Motor Show .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport , among other things , highlights the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid change to digital radio .
a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria is currently being tested for testing new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; avoid additional liability risks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use international efforts to increase the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicles from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
in addition , the Federal Government wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only envis@@ aged people as drivers .
when automated driving , the car is increasingly taking the lead , the driver becomes more and more passengers .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads should be expected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
value added in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the Germany site estimate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to about 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the passenger can lead to more safety and efficiency in road transport , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Social @-@ politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the Germans are still scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted on Wednesday by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the test organization Dek@@ ra came to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonom@@ ously driving cars will prevail in the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect to believe it in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe in it at all .
in France , 21 percent of those surv@@ eyed until 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , 33 percent in the United States .
in Germany , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the Bit@@ kom digital network , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire drive on all roads .
at least 15 percent of the traffic in flowing traffic could be expected on the motorway , 45 percent in traffic jams .
good every fourth would leave the car to control under no circumstances .
Bol@@ l Sa@@ ys Team@@ - and Double Start at Table Tennis Championships
according to the current state of the title , the Düsseldorf @-@ based company will only be able to open up in the single market on the 25th of September to the 4th of October .
the final decision should be made no later than 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the guys have learned it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are strong enough , even without Timo to clin@@ ch the title , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time , Bol@@ l was on the way to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ship date in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo the down@@ side , we are no longer a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Individu@@ al European Champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ tal in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also rec@@ alled the Euro 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo also lack@@ ed , and we became European champi@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should be guided by this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the Fi@@ fth Symphony . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English football player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury on the right leg .
during the Champions League game at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven the defender was hit by a tac@@ kling by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and replaced after a long treatment .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins that look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the great star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in coats .
&quot; today I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of hau@@ te cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk on the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from September 18th at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially negative attitude towards a show on his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a little bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you get to the museum .
the impressive collection was previously made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly @-@ looking work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed complete artwork , for which a lot of effort was done : to fr@@ ying the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers gave 14 tons of material to Munich .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special treat : a leather trousers dressing with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a little different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tier &apos;s old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
it stands for the designer &apos;s first , timi@@ d , odi@@ c walking attempts .
as a kid ( he wasn &apos;t a good student and bad in football ) he dressed his ted@@ dy bear and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him .
he later taught the designing of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
for his first own fashion show he did not have to pay the models .
they got nothing , but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewel@@ ery instead of sheer curtain - P@@ lau@@ en tip as fashion niche
it used to be on the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and lace were produced in large quantities for customers , which they processed for example to ceilings and she@@ ers .
that alone is no longer working today , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the pl@@ ums .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early times of the late lace fashion plays a larger role , was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewellery , accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans against past Sti@@ le@@ po@@ chen , is an increasing order potential .
those who do not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already account for half of all orders .
in cooperation with nine other companies , Ms. P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the Industry Association of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been cut off .
there are almost no private specialist shops and wholesale dealers .
our products hardly reach our customers in this way .
today , mass @-@ produced goods are made much cheaper in the Asian region and are sold almost exclusively via chains .
in addition , exports are weak@@ ening , currently to Russia and to the US .
so there are plenty of reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to score points with environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains of the embroi@@ dery in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year we have been leading a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schne@@ e@@ berg regional office of the West@@ säch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - special@@ ising in embroi@@ dery and lace .
in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
this takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the companies that must think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design will often only be slightly varied to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historic snow@@ ball tip .
the machine sti@@ cking small spheres at some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ en Gold@@ schmi@@ er@@ master Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took inspiration from this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously I couldn &apos;t start with traditional P@@ lau@@ en tip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex process it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of plau@@ sible lace - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and its surroundings and who would like to have a mem@@ ento .
with this I see my jewellery as modern Amb@@ ass@@ adors of the P@@ lau@@ en Peak .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
you don &apos;t want to touch legends , but Disney nevertheless vent@@ ures into a new movie of its classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
according to the Entertainment Week@@ ly , however , it is not about re @-@ filming , but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes place 20 years after the first film with the magic girl girl .
it is about the experience of the N@@ anny and the B@@ anks family in times of the Great Depression in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .

XI ur@@ ges to open the economy more broad@@ ly for the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy must open more broad@@ ly to promote growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group that was t@@ asked with the steering of the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should be committed to attracting foreign investments and know @-@ how and improving the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Board for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
promoting new start @-@ ups and driving reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , X@@ i said .
the management group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list on the regulation of market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the inhabitants milking system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that do not question investment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is important as it as@@ signs a major role to the market in the allocation of resources , guarantees a legal framework and open the market more open , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to the companies and ensure that companies decide how to manage their businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas are opened for private investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policies towards foreign investments and will protect the ri@@ ghtful interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optimizing the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right of lawyers to guarantee their activity and to employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as reported in a declaration published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury level in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and thereby contribute to a much higher dose of the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter .
the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which has received a corresponding EU working paper , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full force to pregnant women and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish , are to be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury each kil@@ ogram of fish .
large pre@@ dat@@ ory fishes are already so strongly polluted with mercury , that on the basis of the still valid limit values approximately 50 percent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ conceivable .
according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram in exchange for this loos@@ ening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because smaller cem@@ et@@ fish , such as car@@ p tend to be so low that they are keeping the planned maximum values already today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de distra@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal heavy metal which is highly toxic to humans , especially in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small amounts especially in case of un@@ born damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health hazard of the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is primarily stimulated by coal combustion in the environment .
according to a written information from the German Federal Ministry of the Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power stations attract more than six tons of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total volume issued in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish , for instance in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube , was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and comprehen@@ sively exceeded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had quoted in March from the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
