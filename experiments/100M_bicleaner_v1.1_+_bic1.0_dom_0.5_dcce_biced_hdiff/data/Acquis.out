the Community and States are sure that civil liability for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , may be used in accordance with their laws and other regulations , to the organization and their officials for the purpose of carrying out this agreement in the same way as on the citizens of the states .
any claim that the community or the state against the organization or the organization vis @-@ à @-@ vis the community or the state over damage - with the exception of damages from a nuclear incident - is asser@@ ted that the implementation of the security measures after this agreement is governed in accordance with international law .
after examining the material information submitted to him by the Director General , the Organization shall not be able to verify that no core material , which must be subject to securing measures after this Convention , may reimbur@@ se the reports provided in Article X@@ II paragraph C of the Stat@@ utes and , if necessary , take the other measures envis@@ aged there .
in such steps , the Council takes into account the extent to which weight has been acquired by the measures applied , and provides the community or the state - as far as each of the two parties is concerned - every reasonable opportunity to grant the Council the necessary security .
on request of the organization , the community or a state , consultations on questions arise which arise from the interpretation or application of this agreement .
the Community and the States are entitled to request that any questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Agreement shall be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the concerned state to participate in discussing such issues by the Council .
with the exception of disputes settled by the Council after Article 19 or a measure taken by the Council , disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this agreement are resolved , and which are not included in the negotiation process or by another procedure agreed by the Organization , the Community and the States , to submit to an arbit@@ ral tribunal which consists of five arbitr@@ ators .
the Community and the States appoint two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators appointed appoint a fifth to lead the presi@@ dency .
if the Community and the States or the Organization have not been appointed arbitr@@ ators within thirty days after the application for an arbit@@ ration request , the Community or the Organization may seek to appoint the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbitr@@ ators .
the same procedure must be applied if the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been chosen within thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court are competent , and all decisions require the consent of at least three arbitr@@ ators .
the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are binding for the organisation , the community and the countries concerned .
a ) This Convention stands for non @-@ nuclear states , the contracting party of the contract and members of the Community ( in force , i ) if the relevant state of the organization is notified that its proceedings are concluded for the entry into force of this Convention and
II ) If the community of the organization is notified that it is able to apply its security measures in relation to this state for the purposes of this Convention .
a ) The organization , the community and the States consult each other on the request of one of the contracting parties to am@@ end this agreement .
B ) All changes require the consent of the Organization , the Community and the States .
C ) The General Director immediately teaches all Member States of the organization of every change of this agreement .
a ) This Convention comes into force on the day the organization of the Community and the States receives the written Noti@@ fication that their procedures for entry into force are completed .
B ) This Convention remains as long as the states contracting party of the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the agreement and the protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures to be applied in the implementation of the provisions of the part I on securing measures as required .
the aim of the preventive measures set out in this Convention is the timely detection of the bran@@ ching of significant quantities of nuclear activities for nuclear weapons and other nuclear missi@@ les for unknown purposes and deter@@ rence by the risk of early detection .
for the provision of the objective set forth in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , composite with spatial confin@@ ement and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical conclusion of the inspections by the organisation is carried out by an explanation in which the quantity of material which is not specified for a specific period of time is specified by speci@@ fying the accuracy limits for the specified measures .
in carrying out their follow @-@ up examinations , the organization makes full use of the community &apos;s security system after Article 3 .
the accounting and control system of the Community for core material in accordance with this Convention is based on a structure in material @-@ balance zones .
in the application of its security measures , the community will make use of de procedures and measures of the following kind and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are more and more appropriate in the complementary agreements :
a ) a measurement system for determining the quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost or otherwise removed core material and stocks ;
( B ) the evaluation of reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for determining , testing and evaluating differences in the measurements of sen@@ ders and recipients ;
e ) procedure for the assessment of accum@@ ulations of un@@ measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;
( F ) a protocol and report system , which displays the core material inventory for each material balance zone and the changes in this stock including the input / output of the material balance zone ;
g ) precau@@ tions to ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) procedure for reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the hed@@ ging measures under this agreement do not cover material in the mining industry or in ore preparation .
B ) Will Intro@@ duc@@ ed Ur@@ an - or th@@ ori@@ um@@ hal@@ ous material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , entered into the States , so the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , provided that it is not introduced for specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) will leave the core material , which is suitable for the composition and purity of fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is produced , or is the core material produced in the States in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , so it is subject to the other security measures mentioned in this agreement .
a ) The provisions envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . however , if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not fulfilled , the community must consult each other on the use of suitable securing measures in accordance with the provisions mentioned in Article 11 .
B ) The provisions envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the Community unanim@@ ously determine that this core material is practically non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able .
at the request of the community , the organization fre@@ es the following core material from the security measures following this Convention :
a ) special fis@@ sile material , if it is used in grams or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) core material if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such a core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % .
at the request of the community , the organization fre@@ es out core material which would otherwise be subject to securing measures under the Convention , provided that the total amount of material released in the States is not at any point in time than in the United States .
a ) A total of one kil@@ ogram of special fol@@ dable material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with an accumulation of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with accumulation ,
III ) Ur@@ an with a enrich@@ ment , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ an@@ ium , is calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the fi@@ v@@ ef@@ old square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ an@@ ium and depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with a enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) 20 metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an accumulation of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if released nuclear material is to be processed or stored together with core material which is subject to the safegu@@ arding measures under this agreement , precau@@ tions for the re @-@ application of the securing measures are taken to that material .
the community meets with the organisation of supple@@ menting agreements which , in the scope which is required for successful and effective assistance of the tasks of the organization after the Convention , determine in detail how the procedures established in the Convention are to be applied .
the supplementary agreements can be extended or altered without amend@@ ment to this agreement in agreement between the organization and the community .
the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this agreement . the organization , the community and the states undertake all the efforts to make these agreements come into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this agreement ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
on the basis of the initial report outlined in article 62 , the Organization has set up a consolidated inventory of the whole , the securing measures of this agreement underlying the underlying core material in the states , irrespective of its origin , and continues to carry out this inventory due to the subsequent reports and the results of their investigation .
between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States of Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , the United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other
( GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ DE - a ) The E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme set at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is ham@@ pered by general res@@ sources problems .
C ) It is the objective of the E@@ EC and Member States that the contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months following the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entering into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its best to achieve this goal .
D ) The E@@ EC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed execution and management of this agreement and the central bind@@ ings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the scope of this agreement .
for this purpose , the organization of the E@@ EC has presented a table showing how to apply the criteria specified in this agreement -
&quot; &quot; &quot; the organization establishes a special account under the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Trade F@@ ee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which consists of the funds that Member States act in accordance with this Agreement . this account is referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Administrator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the organization , and only for the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the special transaction account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment shall be made in the form of cash or in@@ trin@@ sic bonds of the member state , which are to be paid in the currency of the respective state by order of the organization as the administrator of the special transaction account and to be deposited at the deposit of the organization in the respective country .
B ) The payment shall be made in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 BG@@ N . of the order within 30 days of the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the administrator at the appointed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or another time agreed between the E@@ EC and the bai@@ li@@ ff , taking into account the periods required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) E@@ ach Member State may make payments to the aforementioned dates upon request .
in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker takes about proportion@@ ate drawing on cash or the Notes in order to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and to balance the transaction account in an appropriate manner .
when granting these loans , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the E@@ EC :
III ) to the extent that international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
VI ) the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further lending capacity to loan terms without dis@@ approval ; and
VII ) the extent in which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
each transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly exp@@ ectable development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral plan ) , which is considered , approved , approved and managed according to the methods and practices used for the organization financed by the organization , with the objective of the pre@@ am@@ ble to be taken into account with this agreement .
the funds of the promotion account must not be used instead of ordinary funds from the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the organization which is bound by a loan or credit for a program or project , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .
apart from section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same re@@ payment terms , which are generally valid for the organization granted for the organization ; thus , they are ref@@ und@@ able in ten free years each in 50 years .
transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts for payment of this watch are to be paid directly to the organization that reserves it .
each transaction is subject to a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the bai@@ li@@ ff , in which the source of the funds is stated in particular .
the revenue from each transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services which are made or produced in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization and which , according to the provis@@ o of what the bai@@ li@@ ff specified at the time of loan guarantee , could be the recipient of a transaction loan .
capital re@@ payments from special transaction loans take place on the special transaction account , and the amount paid in the currency of a member state is to be transferred back as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned .
the car@@ et@@ aker will instruc@@ t the E@@ EC on the projects and programs approved by the directors for the purpose of the audit by the directors in preparation until the full payment of all transaction loans .
during the time of the payment of the special transaction loan , the bai@@ li@@ ff teaches the E@@ EC four times a year about the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses made for this .
the car@@ et@@ aker transfers the E@@ EC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the financial account with a statement from the external audi@@ tor of the organization for this statement of accounts .
after full payment of the transaction loan , the administrator of the E@@ EC transm@@ its a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account as soon as possible .
the car@@ et@@ aker creates and exec@@ utes appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts to be financed from the account recei@@ pts , which are deposited on the account and deposits paid out of the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States .
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrator through to the full edition of the funds of the special transaction account from time to time carry out an exchange of ideas on the status of the special transaction account , the progress of programs or projects financed by special transactions and on all other issues relating to the provisions of this Agreement .
if this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date , which the E@@ EC and the Organisation may agree on , the agreement and all ensu@@ ing obligations of the parties are due to immediate effect .
if the total capital of all the bene@@ fici@@ aries is paid back in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all ensu@@ ing obligations of the parties are terminated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires the approval of the individual Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural regulations of each party .
the governments of the Member States have notified the Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the proceedings concerning them .
the General Sec@@ retariat will forward these noti@@ fications along with a notification of the proper approval of this agreement with the E@@ EC to the organization .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month which follows the day of receipt of the stated noti@@ fications in the organization .
this agreement is written in two manus@@ cripts in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , each wor@@ ding is equally authentic .
whereas the agreement in the form of a letter change to change the Anne@@ x A of the Protocol No 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is to be concluded :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the area of controlled fusion and plasma physics
the EURO@@ P@@ Ä@@ IS@@ CHE Nu@@ clear Association , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; Commission , &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and THE Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Federal Council &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this program includes the creation of a large test facility , the project JET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , the construction and operation of a joint venture under Section V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty .
Switzerland has been involved in research in the area of controlled fusion and plasma physics for several years and is very familiar with the area concerned .
since up to the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion still extensive work is to be carried out , it is in the interest of the contractual parties of the present agreement to summari@@ ze their relevant efforts to avoid unnecessary overl@@ apping and to accelerate their respective research , which have reached a higher priority level due to the energy crisis -
this agreement should enable every contracting party to benefit from a pooling of their research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics from the means provided for both research work , avoiding unnecessary overl@@ apping and , accordingly , the common objective of these research work , i.e. the cost @-@ moder@@ ately competitive electricity generation by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction .
to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes defined in Anne@@ x I and II of this Agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme , &quot; and &quot; Swiss Programme . &quot;
to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss programme takes over the long @-@ term goals and forms of co @-@ operation of the Eur@@ atom program ; it is thus expanded or altered by the organs mentioned in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present Agreement , that it may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom programme .
each time the contracting parties adopt a new program , this is the place of the programs listed in Anne@@ x I and II to the present Agreement .
the Association shall be realised in paragraph 1 by : - appropriate participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and execution of the programmes of the other party ;
- Exchange of staff among the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , Switzerland and third countries with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , as well as the laboratories running on the Eur@@ atom agenda ;
- mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programmes .
as part of the objective of the present agreement , Switzerland is participating in the project JET .
in view of the association agreement envis@@ aged in Article 2 Section 1 of this Agreement , the Parties concluded an association agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those who are referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s &quot; in view of the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the same objective Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland is involved with the timing of the present agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange , which is closed between the Commission and the associated institutions , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agreement on Human Resources &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the JET &apos;s involvement in the JET , Switzerland , with the timing of the entry into force of the present agreement , belongs to the common company JET , whose stat@@ ute accepts them .
Eur@@ atom also concerns that Switzerland can become a contractual partner of any contract whose destination falls within the scope of the present agreement , excluding association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity period of the present agreement .
the bodies entrusted with the carrying out of the association in Article 2 Section 1 of the present Agreement are described in Articles 5 to 10 of this Agreement and in the Association Agreement .
the Association Agreement , in particular , includes the suspension of a steering committee , the responsible representative of the Commission and the Federal Council .
- to monitor the development of research and to direct the best possible results in line with the goals of this agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland is represented by at most two delegates in the connection group used within the scope of the Eur@@ atom program - in the following &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VG &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the VG , who has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters concerning current or planned programs and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom program , perc@@ ei@@ ves this task with regard to all research and development activities relating to this agreement .
in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated organisations and establishes their T * ity in the interests of the two Parties to the common objective outlined in the Eur@@ atom Programme and the Swiss agenda , as well as the common objective outlined in Article 1 of the present agreement , with respect to the scientific and technological developments in the world .
in accordance with its Rules of Proced@@ ure , the VG will appoint one or more Swiss representatives in the consulting groups created within the scope of the Eur@@ atom Programme , whenever the competent Swiss authorities are looking for .
the consulting groups , which are subject to the VG research proposals with a view to providing the best possible scientific results for the Eur@@ atom programme , are perc@@ ei@@ ving this task with regard to all research and development work referred to in this agreement .
as part of the Eur@@ atom programme , Switzerland is represented by the director of one of the laboratories involved .
the Committee of Directors , who is responsible for supervis@@ ing the conduct of the Eur@@ atom programme and who is responsible for the best use of the capacities of laboratories , which are involved in the work carried out within the programme , will perform this task in terms of all research and development work that fall under the present agreement .

agreement in the form of a letter exchange between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobili@@ zation of member states &apos; demands as part of medium @-@ term financial support
the BI@@ S could close stand@@ by loan agreements with the central banks of credi@@ tor countries when the banks submit a corresponding application .
the agreement could be concluded by the total amount of the fee paid by the credi@@ tor , within a total limit of EUR 2,@@ 7@@ 25 billion ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery funds of the member countries .
however , some conditions are already mentioned below , for which the BI@@ Z would be willing to use .
with each stand @-@ by loan , the BI@@ S would first assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als without having to exceed five years altogether .
at the opening of the loans and in its event@@ ual extension , the BI@@ S would charge a credit entry fee .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first draws should not be made before the end of a month after completion of the Stand@@ by Agreement so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments of its own liquidity .
the drawing would take place in the currencies available in the BI@@ S at the end of the agreement , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend over time periods which would be taking into account the funds of the Bank , probably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those who employ the BI@@ S at the time under similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to market rates .
if the BI@@ S has to obtain the necessary funds itself on the market , then the interest rate to be applied could reach a maximum , corresponding to the Li@@ bor raised by a corresponding margin .
I would be grateful if you would share with me the approval of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ S could close stand@@ by loan agreements with the central banks of credi@@ tor countries when the banks submit a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would share with me the approval of the Council of the European Communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the form of a letter exchange between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Ö@@ stlich der Uruguay about trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat
I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to define provisions on imports of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay into the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the Common Market Organisation for sheep and goat meat . in the course of these negotiations , the two parties are agreed as follows :
- Fresh or ch@@ illed H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( Tari@@ ff Point 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) of the Common Custom@@ s Tari@@ ff ) ;
- Fro@@ zen poultry - , lamb and goat meat ( tari@@ ff point 02.@@ 01 A IV b ) of the common customs tari@@ ff ) .
under this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay to the Community are set to the following annual amount :
in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Uruguay is committed to ensure that the estimated annual amount does not exceed the agreed quantity and is executed according to conventional supply forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
should a change in the form of offer be possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other prior to the introduction of such a change in the Committee referred to under the number 10 in order to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the community takes advantage of the protective clause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the Urugu@@ ay@@ an access to the community market regulated by this agreement will not be affected .
in the event that imports exceed the agreed quantities in a year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Uruguay for the rest of the year .
the community comm@@ its itself to restrict the exhaus@@ tion of the products made by this agreement to a ho@@ of rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
in the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Uruguay will change the amount specified under the number 2 according to the scope of Urugu@@ ay@@ an trade with each new Member State .
the import duties for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this shall be taken into account with the ho@@ of rate listed under the number 5 .
the total amount mentioned in number 2 is determined by the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the community to 5 800 tonnes of car@@ c@@ ass weight .
the community under@@ takes all to avoid a market development that could affect the marketing of Urugu@@ ay@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb on the common market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the Community is taking precau@@ tions to prevent the sale of frozen meat from frozen meat , due to the implementation of the regulation , not under@@ mining the he@@ el of Urugu@@ ay@@ an works .
taking into account the aims and provisions of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual application of re@@ funds or other funding measures for the export of h@@ amm@@ el and lamb and slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs is only at prices and conditions that are in line with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community in world trade with these products .
these terms are to be interpreted in a manner consistent with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T , and in particular Article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention to the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the Universal Custom@@ s and Trade Agreement .
Uruguay , in particular , guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular by granting export lic@@ ences specified in this agreement for the products listed under the number 1 .
the community comm@@ its itself to take all necessary precau@@ tions in order to make the granting of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products based in Uruguay by the submission of an export license which is issued by the competent authority designated by the Urugu@@ ay@@ an government .
furthermore , in implementing provisions , the responsible Urugu@@ ay@@ an authority of the responsible authority of the community at regular intervals carries out the quantities issued for export lic@@ ences ; this information may be en@@ coded according to destination country if necessary .
this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty is applied to the establishment of the European Economic Community , and on the one hand , on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Ö@@ stlich der Uruguay on the other .
it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that date , it remains in force , subject to the right of any party to termin@@ ate it in writing with a period of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this Agreement shall be reviewed by the two parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes that they consider necessary .
I would be grateful if you would confirm the approval of your government with this letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations on the consolidation of provisions on imports of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay into the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the Common Market Organisation for sheep and goat meat . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the contracting parties of the European Convention on 15 December 1958 on the exchange of therapeutic substances of human origin ( referred to as the &quot; Con@@ ventions &quot; ) -
based on Article 5 ( 1 ) of the Convention that &quot; Parties shall &quot; meet all the necessary measures &quot; to free them of all the therapeutic substances made available to them by the other parties &quot; ;
whereas for the Member States of the European Economic Community , the obligation to grant this liberation to the jurisdiction of the community falls , which , according to the treaty by which it was founded , has the powers required to do so ;
whereas it is necessary to carry out Article 5 ( 1 ) of the Convention that the European Economic Community can become a contracting party of the Convention .
the Convention comes into force for the Community on the first day of the month following the signing .
it comes into force on the first day of the month which follows the day when the last of the parties have deposited their acceptance certificate with the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe .
( 2 ) This additional protocol , however , occurs after two years after the date in force , to which it was placed on acceptance , if not one of the contracting parties has made a objection against its entry into force .
from this point on , a state cannot become a contracting party of the Convention , without becoming a contracting party of the additional protocol .
the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe noti@@ fies the Member States of the Council of Europe , all States and the European Economic Community rati@@ fying any acceptance or objection as part of Article 2 as well as the timing of the entry into force of this additional protocol according to Article 2 .
the general secretary noti@@ fies the European Economic Community also any action , notification or communication relating to this Convention .
considering that it is highly desirable if Member States support each other in the spirit of European solidarity in proc@@ uring re@@ agents for blood group determination , if necessary ,
whereas this mutual support is only possible if the nature and use of these re@@ agents are submitted to the blood group determination jointly by the Member States , and the necessary facilities and exceptions are granted for their import@@ ation -
&quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of this agreement , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ agents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means blood group determination &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ agents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of human , animal , plant and other origin for the determination of blood and to determine blood in@@ compatibility . &quot; &quot; &quot;
any contracting party may limit the application of this Convention on re@@ agents of human origin to blood group determination by signing the Convention or in the back of its rati@@ fication , approval or accession document by a statement directed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe .
the declaration can be withdrawn at any time by a Noti@@ fication directed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe .
the Parties undertake to leave re@@ agents for blood group determination to reimbur@@ se the costs of their extraction , preparation and transport and , if necessary , the purchase price of other parties to their urgent need , provided they themselves have sufficient supplies for their own needs .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are made available to other parties only under the condition that no profit is associated with it , that they are only used for medical purposes and only designated by the governments involved .
each stream of re@@ agents for blood group determination is a certificate to add that they were produced in accordance with the regulations of the protocol .
the protocol and its system constitute an administrative agreement which can be am@@ ended or am@@ ended by the governments of the contracting parties of this agreement .
the Parties shall take all necessary measures to liber@@ ate the re@@ agents provided to them from other contractual parties for blood group determination of all input charges .
they also meet all the necessary measures to ensure that these substances respond quickly and quickly to the recipient in article 3 .
the parties are communicated to each other by the Secretary General of the Council of Europe , a list of places authorized to exhibit the certificates provided in Article 4 .
these positions should be the same as possible with the positions designated in Article 6 of the European Convention on the exchange of therapeutic substances of human origin .
this Convention is for the members of the Council of Europe to sign up ; they may become a contracting party ( by signing it a ) without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval , or
this Convention comes into force one month after the day three members of the Council have signed or rati@@ fied it under Article 7 without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval .
for each member , which is signed or approved later without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval , or rati@@ fied or approved , it shall enter into force one month after its signature or the deposit of the rati@@ fication or approval certificate .
after the entry into force of this agreement , the Council of Europe &apos;s minist@@ erial committee can invite any non @-@ member state to join the Convention .
the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe noti@@ fies the members of the Council and the accession states a ) the timing of the entry into force of this Convention and the names of the members who have signed or rati@@ fied it without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval ;
any contracting party may termin@@ ate the agreement with the Secretary General of the Council of Europe following a period of one year .
a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples containing the an@@ tigen , which is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or other substance indicated on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the way recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena cannot occur : a ) h@@ amm@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured on the double in a suitable medium due to the ever @-@ renewed di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be analyzed .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum th@@ inning in which a reaction occurs ; th@@ inning is calculated exclusively by the volume of blood cells flow in the total volume .
if anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents are to be used on object bear@@ ers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has established international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity , standards are developed at present .
according to the definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination of most specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ic acid , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in an ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te floo@@ ding .
the ti@@ ter speci@@ fies the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the final mixture within a series where a micro@@ scopic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of the re@@ agents for blood group determination , available for the international standard preparations ( at the time Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete Anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the title of the unknown agent in international units ( See Bul@@ letin ) O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ eren contain 256 international units per ml .
the preparations are available for free from the International Laboratory of Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of a comparative ti@@ tr@@ ation of the International Standard Ser@@ um Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2@@ B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its necessary properties should remain for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in liquid form according to label lies at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents on the label is based on the results of the feasibility studies ; it is approved by the national supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is closed so that no moisture can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 B.C. of its weight if it is tested by further drying via phosphor@@ us pent@@ oxi@@ d under a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that the agent ( or the sol@@ vents delivered with the dry re@@ agents ) will be added an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic if the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to meet the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein @-@ nitrogen per ml flu@@ es@@ y or re @-@ dissolved serum .
re@@ agents , whether in liquid form or after replacement , must be transparent and must contain neither sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents destined for the international exchange of blood group determination should not be colored arti@@ ficially as far as possible , at least until an international agreement has been established on a unified system .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all stages of production and control of the re@@ agents for blood group determination .
appropriate samples of all re@@ agents issued are to be stored for a long time from the laboratory until it can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
re@@ agents used for blood group determination may contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective portion , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to the origin of their effective share .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin .
on each individual container is a black on white printed label in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the quantity or , in dried re@@ agents , the amount and composition of the liquid needed for recovery ,
in addition , this label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located , or the instructions attached to the containers , contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
3. the quantity or , in dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid needed for recovery ,
each consi@@ gn@@ ment must be enclosed with a certificate according to Article 4 of the Convention according to the system to this protocol .

the effectiveness of the serum must in no case be less than 64 international units per ml .
un@@ dil@@ uted anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood serum must also cause an easily recognis@@ able ag@@ glut@@ ination of the blood cells of the A@@ x group ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) .
if an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on an object bearing of equal amounts of 5@@ - to 10 % floods of A1 and A2 blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time required if the same tests are performed with the un@@ dil@@ uted , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the Anti @-@ A blood group serum or with a standard preparation of the same activity .

the following demands on the effectiveness of Ser@@ a for determining the R@@ h group may be changed if international standard preparations are available . i ) Anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is obtained from the blood of one or more persons , which are immun@@ ised by the tigen D of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain the tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 32 compared to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9 percent sal@@ ine solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , the serum should react with blood cells that contain do @-@ an@@ tigen .
anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which is intended to be used by object bear@@ ers according to the test nach Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds .

it re@@ acts with in@@ und@@ ations of human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C an@@ tigen .
these serv@@ ings are therefore only specific for the C @-@ an@@ tigen if the tested blood cells are bil@@ lowing in a 0.@@ 9 % sal@@ ine solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ti@@ ter of the Anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incomplete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 compared to c@@ c@@ d@@ dee &apos;s blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;

specific@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood of immun@@ ised persons or can be produced by mixing anti @-@ D with anti @-@ D or anti @-@ E serum .
in a given serum , both antibodies must be effective under the reaction conditions set by the manufacturer at the same time .
if a serum for use on object bear@@ ers is determined according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ational time should not be less than with the ant@@ ei@@ mer antibodies .
anti @-@ A serum is extracted from the blood of animals that can be immun@@ ised by blood cells or specific substances of the group A .

in DE@@ M W@@ UN@@ SCH , to facilitate the acquisition , comparison and evaluation of statistical data , especially those of international trade ,
in DE@@ M W@@ UN@@ SCH to reduce the costs resulting from the fact that in international trade goods goods have to be re@@ marked in the transition from one classification system to another , newly submitted and re @-@ en@@ coded , and in order to facilitate the harmon@@ isation of commercial documents and the transmission of data ,
in the weighing that the development of the technology and structures of international trade marked significant changes in the Brussels Agreement of 15 December 1950 concerning the tari@@ ff scheme for the import of goods into tari@@ ffs ,
in addition , IN THE CH@@ AN@@ GE that the level of differentiation demanded by governments and the economy for customs @-@ tari@@ ff and statistical purposes is currently far beyond what is contained in the system to the aforementioned agreement ,
in the weighing that it is important to have accurate and comparable data in international trade negotiations ,
in the weighing system , that the harmon@@ ised system is to be used for the transport tari@@ ffs and traffic statistics of various types of transport ,
in the weighing that the harmon@@ ised system is intended to be included as far as possible in the systems used in the trade for the designation and encoding of the goods ,
in the weighing that the harmon@@ ised system should help to establish a close inter@@ relation between the import and export statistics on the one hand and the production statistics on the other , IN DER , that a close inter@@ relation between the Harmon@@ ised System and the International Consumer Index for the Foreign Trade ( S@@ IT@@ C ) of the United Nations is to be maintained ,
in the discretion that it is desirable to comply with the requirements listed above by a combined tari@@ ff and statistical gap , which is appropri@@ ated for the use by international trade stakeholders ,

taking into account the works provided by the Council for co @-@ operation in the area of customs duties for the harmon@@ ised system in this field ,
