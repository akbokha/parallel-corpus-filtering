this document is a summary of the European Public Research Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
if you need further information about your illness or your treatment , please read the package leaf@@ let ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
for further information on the basis of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg of melting tablets ( tablets which dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. un@@ polar thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental condition in which the patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal high @-@ tuning ) alter@@ nat@@ ely with periods of normal mood .
abili@@ fy is used for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and for the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for rapid control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if the oral intake of the medicine is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be used to take in or the melting tablets in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients who are taking other drugs at the same time as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted .
this interfer@@ es with the transmission of signals between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. , chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells to one another .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is believed to be a &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole acts like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in a lesser degree than the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter acts to activate the recept@@ ors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole contributes to normal@@ ising the activity of the brain , reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing it from occurring .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy , preventing the recur@@ rence of symptoms , was examined in three studies over to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar disorders that suffered from increased rest@@ lessness , over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence , in 160 patients where the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased un@@ rest , with which of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , changing the symptoms of patients was investigated using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responded to treatment .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution for taking off ( absor@@ bs ) .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly greater reduction in symptoms than those receiving placebo .
in the application to treat bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies .
moreover , up to 74 weeks Abi@@ li@@ fy effectively prevented the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses also decreased more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similar effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy for taking ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( un@@ controlled ) , nausea , vom@@ iting ( nausea ) , hyper@@ secre@@ tion ( increased sali@@ va production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety states .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who predominantly had man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes were addressing the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole across the risks .
furthermore , the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in case of rapid control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if oral therapy is not appropriate , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the placing of Abi@@ li@@ fy across the European Union .
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes were addressing the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy amounts to 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
considering the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , even when treating with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that there was no increased suicide risk in patients with bi@@ polar disorder compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose of hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering medicines ) or hypertension ( including cel@@ ery and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
if symptoms and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia are present in a patient treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy , it should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms indic@@ ative of a M@@ NS , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be deposited .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or at states associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
there was , however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response to un@@ desired cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events involving patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including Abi@@ li@@ fy .
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events involving Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ ps , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gy and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of deterior@@ ating glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally @-@ effective medicines with over@@ bearing side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ ites , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 Exten@@ sive Met@@ abol@@ ites .
considering the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be raised to the dose height before starting the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be administered with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ ph@@ om@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an @-@ R@@ atio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ met@@ amorph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
this drug may not be used during pregnancy , unless the potential benefits are clearly the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned of using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them .
the following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant adverse events ( * ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks , a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including par@@ in@@ son@@ ism , ac@@ ath@@ isie , d@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurred in patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 13.@@ 1 % in patients treated with placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 1 % in patients with O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder - In a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 23@@ ,5 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
another study of 12 weeks showed the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 17.@@ 6 % for those with lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % was for patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
CP@@ K increases ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
the side effects associated with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy are the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desired cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ intended or inten@@ tional acute over@@ doses were observed with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without deaths .
there is no information on the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of an over@@ dose because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma protein binding .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is medi@@ ated in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder over the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor and to the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 and 5@@ HT@@ 2 receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 4 , to the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11@@ C @-@ rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D@@ 2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , a D@@ 2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the cycl@@ amen demonstrated a dose dependent dose of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in one hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , in week 52 the proportion of respon@@ der patients who had a response to study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values of measured scales , which were defined as secondary educational goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery depression scale , showed significantly stronger improvement than at hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher decline in the rate of return , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ tap @-@ controlled , multi @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , significantly fewer patients achieved a weight gain of at least 7 % versus the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg in an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage more than 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a superior efficacy compared to placebo in the reduction of man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic traits , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a versus placebo @-@ superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect that was comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia , such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic traits , which sometimes did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole resulted in superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had reached a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabil@@ isation stage before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superi@@ ority over the prevention of bi@@ polar disorder , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se in the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the hydro@@ xy@@ ulation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ ness is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean elimination time is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in extensive metabol@@ ites via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours for poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ ites via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , and in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients no gender @-@ dependent effects were observed .
a pop@@ up @-@ specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not reveal any clin@@ ically significant differences in terms of ethnic origin or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose trial in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no importance for clinical use .
the effects included dose @-@ dependent non @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ Pig@@ ment Acc@@ um@@ ulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase of adren@@ al @-@ kidney cancer and combined adren@@ al cor@@ tex @-@ aden@@ omas / carcin@@ omas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the average Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
furthermore , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the mean steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the recommended maximum dose in humans ( based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole found in the human bile at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg are no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the g@@ all of monkeys , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro sol@@ ubil@@ ity .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which led to expos@@ ures of the 3- and 11 @-@ fold of the central Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

15 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is medi@@ ated in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder over the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .

46 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had reached a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabil@@ isation stage before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superi@@ ority over the prevention of bi@@ polar disorder , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se in the man@@ ia .
the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
patients experiencing difficulty swal@@ lowing Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets can take the melting tablets as an alternative to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders has been reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , even when treating with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .

clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , rigi@@ dity , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .

it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is medi@@ ated in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder over the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in an O@@ lan@@ tap @-@ controlled , multi @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , significantly fewer patients achieved a weight gain of at least 7 % versus the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg in an average weight of ca .

in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which led to expos@@ ures of the 3- and 11 @-@ fold of the central Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
Abi@@ li@@ fy &apos;s injection solution is used for rapid control of ag@@ gregation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution should be terminated and commen@@ ced with oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
to increase the absorption and minim@@ ise the vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account the medicines already used for maintenance or ac@@ utely treatment ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is indicated , see the summary of the features of the drug to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy Mel@@ ting tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution for taking .
there are no investigations on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with in@@ toxic@@ ation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , which were otherwise caused by schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution , patients should be observed regarding extreme se@@ dation or a blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) .
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose of hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering medicines ) or hypertension ( including cel@@ ery and malign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , stiff@@ ness , varying levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
poly@@ di@@ ps , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gy and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of deterior@@ ating glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ dation was greater compared to that after the exclusive application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study where healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) were used as one @-@ time addition intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly and simultaneously received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ ites , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in comparison with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 Exten@@ sive Met@@ abol@@ ites .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be raised to the dose height before starting the accompanying therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly received , the intensity of se@@ dation was greater compared to that after exclusive application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant adverse events ( * ) ( see Section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant adverse events ( * ) in clinical trials ( see Section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients treated with placebo .
another study of 12 weeks showed the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those with lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % was for patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
CP@@ K increases ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ phosph@@ ate kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
the side effects associated with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy are the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desired cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders were the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution with statisti@@ cally significant greater improvements of ast@@ ral / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders associated with placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , as well as aspir@@ ation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant stronger improvement in the symptoms regarding in@@ toxic@@ ation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the average improvement from bas@@ eline to the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour final score was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ gregation , a similar effectiveness was observed regarding the total population , but a statistical significance could be determined based on a decreased number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in one hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , in week 52 the proportion of respon@@ der patients who had a response to study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values of measurement scales , which were defined as secondary educational goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression scale , showed significantly stronger improvement than at hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a significantly higher decline in the rate of return , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ tap @-@ controlled , multi @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &quot; weight gain , &quot; in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic traits , which sometimes did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole resulted in superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabil@@ isation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superi@@ ority over the prevention of bi@@ polar disorder , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se in the man@@ ia .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C is 90 % higher in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection of the same dose as tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the average plasma levels were up to 3 hours after the maximum plasma level reached .
the application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated exposure to systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were 15@@ - or 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly .
in studies on the reprodu@@ ci@@ bility of intraven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ relevant concerns were observed after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human@@ istic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures that exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; thus , they have limited or no importance for clinical use .
the effects included dose @-@ dependent non @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ Pig@@ ment Acc@@ um@@ ulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase of adren@@ al @-@ kidney cancer ( AU@@ C ) at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 times of the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
furthermore , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the recommended maximum dose in humans ( based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ fold of the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose , were observed .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , about three quarters of which had previously received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in single gift or mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
overall , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane were treated to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel .
only those patients who were treated for the first time in metastatic breast cancer have seen no difference between the drugs in terms of efficacy indicators , such as time to worsen@@ ing disease and survival .
in contrast , patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel .
it may also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before the treatment begins .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel and that unlike other pac@@ lit@@ axel drugs , drugs should not be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing treatment is not shown ( see also Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ al count &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the subsequent series .
in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy degree 3 the treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is achieved to degrees 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles , the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose changes in patients with mild to moderate impairment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies were conducted with patients with impaired ren@@ al function and there are currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose changes in patients with impairment of the kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound Nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel which could have significantly different pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other pac@@ lit@@ axel form@@ ulations ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a symptom@@ atic treatment is initiated , and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ axel again .
in patients no renewed abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ al count increased again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number increased again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly @-@ related cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity has not been proven , cardiac out@@ ages in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying cardiac or lung disease .
if patients receive nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea after the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating means .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or in child@@ bearing age who do not have effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel .
women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable method of contrac@@ eption during and up to one month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised not to produce a child during and up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised prior to treatment using a block@@ age service , since the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very frequent ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) affecting the per@@ spir@@ ation and ability to operate machinery .
the following are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events that occurred in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most prominent hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( in 79 % of patients reported ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects that have occurred in combination with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy for each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : elevated blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosphor@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :
dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue burning , dry mouth , pain in the g@@ ums , loose stool , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , pain in the abdom@@ en , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract :
pain in the abdominal wall , weakness of muscles , neck pain , gro@@ in pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal muscles , flan@@ k pain , discomfort in limbs , muscle weakness very often :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite in related case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events was established .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules active agent that promotes the consolidation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their de@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network that is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel through endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ d@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umin@@ ate receptor and a pac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation in the area of the tumour occurs due to the alb@@ umin@@ ant protein SP@@ ARC ( sec@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ arm un@@ related studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III comparative study .
in one study , 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion for over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion for over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multic@@ entre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a pac@@ lit@@ axel chemotherapy every 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel 175 mg / m2 , or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 versus 30 minutes in@@ fusion ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a negative overall condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had previously not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; First @-@ Line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity versus pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to decay at bas@@ eline based on the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute inj@@ ections of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was measured in clinical trials .
the exposure to active ingredients ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml , an@@ alog@@ ously to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After IV administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration decreased in a multi @-@ phase manner .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vas@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and / or connection with pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in a study with advanced solid tumours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ axel after intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane were compared with the results after a 3 hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel .
the clear@@ ance of pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher ( 43 % ) after Abra@@ x@@ ane administration than after a solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ axel and also the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , pac@@ lit@@ axel is met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed primarily to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , the average total daily intake of the un@@ modified active ingredient was 4 % of the total dose of 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , indicating a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clear@@ ance .
however , only a few data are available about patients at the age of over 75 years , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and in light of light protected over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti @-@ carcin@@ ogen@@ ic drug and , as with other potentially toxic substances , care should be taken care of when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe , it is slowly inj@@ ected over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution into a Abra@@ x@@ ane gas bottle .
after complete en@@ core of the solution , the water bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure good use of the solid material .
then the water bottle should be turned slowly and cau@@ ti@@ ously for at least 2 minutes and / or inver@@ ted until a complete reset of the powder is done .
if precip@@ itations or dr@@ ink@@ ers are visible , the water bottle must be inver@@ ted gently to achieve complete absorption before application .
the exact total dose volume of the 5 mg / ml @-@ suspension , which is necessary for the patient , is calculated and the corresponding amount of re@@ constituted Abra@@ x@@ ane is inj@@ ected into an empty , sterile PV@@ C@@ - or non @-@ PVC in@@ fusion bag .

member states must ensure that the holder of the authorisation for placing on the market before the market launch the medical specialists in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmac@@ ies with the following information and materials :
• Training brochure • Sum@@ mary of the features of the medicine ( specialist information ) , labelling and packing . • With unique imaging of the correct application of the product , cold boxes for transport by patients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicinal product that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medic@@ aments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in patients with normal blood vessels , in which complications may occur if a blood trans@@ fusion is not possible and a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is not possible before surgery .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a self @-@ blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein .
the injection may also be carried out by the patient or his super@@ visor , provided that they have received appropriate guidance .
patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or patients receiving chemotherapy should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be insp@@ ected prior to treatment in order to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy or in patients with kidney problems an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency or that the body does not respond adequately to the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which it em@@ powers to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared as an injection into a vein as part of a major study of 4@@ 79 patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study were inj@@ ected at least eight weeks for E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o into a vein before they were either converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the change in the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of the skin spra@@ yed in the skin have been studied with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values of patients who were converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained to the same extent as those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison with this , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which occasionally leads to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ elling mig@@ ra@@ ine headaches and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are needed to make sure that this does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to EU directives , evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that manufactures ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for medical personnel in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ce P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG a permit for the placing of ab@@ se@@ amed across the European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion requirements in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multiple my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre@@ existing an@@ a@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
the treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in case of planned larger surgical interventions which require a large volume of blood in women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) .
for the reduction of foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery in adults with no iron deficiency , where high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml , which can not participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pa@@ edi@@ atric patients , in which the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
an@@ a@@ emia symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total illness ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the doctor .
an increase in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can occasionally be observed via or below the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration .
given this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be attempted to achieve the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the lasting ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose should be reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose , which is required for the control of an@@ a@@ emia and the symptoms of an@@ emia .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with less severe initial an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with the initial an@@ a@@ emia less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week by an intraven@@ ous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ E. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
an@@ a@@ emia symptoms and subsequent releases can be different depending on age , gender and total illness ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor .
given this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be attempted to achieve the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose , which is required for the control of the an@@ a@@ emia symptoms .
if after 4 treatment weeks the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reprodu@@ ci@@ ble number of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the bas@@ eline value , the dose of 150 I.@@ E. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ E. / kg once a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase is &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the reprodu@@ ci@@ ble number &lt; 40.000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the bas@@ eline value , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week .
if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ E. / kg ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reprodu@@ ci@@ ble number ≥ 400 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ E. / kg should be maintained three times a week .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ tes number by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , a response to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be abor@@ ted .
patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood c@@ anned foods is required , should receive a dose of 600 I.@@ E. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
the iron sub@@ stitution should start as soon as possible - e.g. several weeks before the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program begins , so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the se@@ amed treatment .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ E. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once weekly for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
in this case epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ E. / kg on 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis can be given via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rinse the hose and ensure an adequate injection of the drug to the circulation .
patients who develop with any ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin on an ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ y ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive an ab@@ se@@ amed or other ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see Section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month before the treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) .
the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients who are unable to participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program : severe coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , peripheral arter@@ ial occ@@ lu@@ sion , vascular disease of carot@@ id or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular accident .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare has been reported on the occurrence of an anti @-@ body medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of action , defined as a decrease in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased demand for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the reprodu@@ ci@@ ble value should be determined and the usual causes for non @-@ contact ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umini@@ um toxic@@ ation , infections or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are investigated .
if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ loid is low ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0.5 % ) , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers are normal , and if no other cause of a loss is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row should be considered to be a PR@@ CA .
data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of an anti @-@ body induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentrations in section 4.2 .
in clinical trials an increased risk of mortality and risk of severe cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit to the ability of epo@@ et@@ ine if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased by means of the concentration needed to control sei@@ zur@@ es and avoid blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should amount to about 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of hypertension .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically active coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart disease , the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentrations , recommended in section 4.2 , should not be exceeded .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet to be di@@ aly@@ sis , is not accelerated by the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
tumour patients receiving chemotherapy should consider a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa administration and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response ( patients who may need to be trans@@ acted ) for evaluating the therapeutic efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
if the H@@ b increase is higher than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 , in order to minimize the risk of potential th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ic an@@ emia - dose adaptation with the aim of holding the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to apply re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , if possible , before beginning epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
patients who undergo a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive appropriate th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , an increased risk of post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vas@@ cul@@ ar@@ tic events can not be ruled out for patients with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial case of &gt; 13 g / dl .
in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ine was not proven to improve overall survival for tumor patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or to reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , when a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose can be adjusted to the rising ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
in vitro studies on tumor tissues there are no indications of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
about th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , cereb@@ ral isch@@ em@@ ic attacks , cereb@@ ro@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , an@@ eur@@ y@@ sm@@ s , retinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the worsen@@ ing of an existing hypertension .
increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vas@@ cul@@ ine events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients treated with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine .
regardless of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , there can be th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications in patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ ated and , in relation to the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content , is identical to the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of local patients .
it could be shown using cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .

survival and tumour progression were studied in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin showed an un@@ explained , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality rate than in the controls due to various frequent malign@@ ancies .
overall survival in the studies could not be satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily explained by differences in the incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis and associated complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and in controls .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value less than 13 g / dl , since few patients were included with these characteristics in the checked data .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa provisions following repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and an extended half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa serum levels are much lower than serum levels achieved by intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no accumulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
( bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and may be caused by secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa three years ago , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients , which were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , was not increased .
14 In animal studies involving nearly 20 times the recommended weekly dose recommended by humans , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to decreased financial body weight , a delay of the Os@@ si@@ fication and an increase in red@@ dish mortality .
these reports are based on in vitro findings with cells from human tumour tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation .

prior to the market launch and in accordance with the agreement with the competent authorities of the member states , the owner of the transport company must provide the medical specialists in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmac@@ ies with the following information and materials : • An overview of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging .
the owner of the marketing authorization must ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system described in version 3.0 and in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the marketing application is set up and functional before the drug is put into circulation and as long as the drug is used in traffic .
the owner of the licensing agreement is obliged to carry out the studies and additional measures for pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance specified in the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan , as in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) specified in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. as well as to any subsequent update of the Risk Management Plan adopted by the CH@@ MP .
according to the CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for Human use , an updated R@@ MP should be provided at the same time with the next updated report on the safety of the drug ( Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) .
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • in the event of new information that may affect current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or risk reduction measures • within 60 days after reaching an important ( the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance or risk reduction ) mil@@ estones
• Have a heart attack or stroke in one month before your treatment • if you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time occurring or increased breast pain ) , the risk of blood cl@@ ots in the veins ( deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ) occurs - if in your case , for example , such a drop of blood has occurred .
you suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial occ@@ lu@@ sion ) , the cervical vessels ( vascular disease of the carot@@ id ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) , you recently suffered a heart attack or stroke .
during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , it can result in a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in plat@@ el@@ et numbers within the normal range , which re@@ stores with further treatment .
your doctor will , if necessary , perform regular blood tests to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
lack of iron , dissolution of the red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be considered and treated before starting the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed .
the appearance of ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ y after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin was very rare .
if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ y , it will break off your therapy with ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how best to treat your an@@ a@@ emia .
therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated for an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
with increased or rising potassium levels , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels are back in normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney disease and clin@@ ically visible coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion signs by insufficient cardiac output , your doctor will make sure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in level does not exceed a particular value .
according to the present findings , the treatment of the an@@ a@@ emia associated with ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) is not accelerated as the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency is not accelerated .
a 2 - 3 week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa administration and the desired effect should be considered for evaluating the efficacy of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your Ab@@ se@@ amed dose to keep the risk of blood cl@@ ut@@ ching ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be carefully balanced against the advantages derived from epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , for example , if you are obes@@ e ( adi@@ p@@ ous ) or if th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events have occurred in the past ( e.g. deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bol@@ ism ) .
if you are a cancer patient , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed will act as a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances will affect the tumor .
if you have a larger orthop@@ edic operation , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly before the treatment starts .
if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get ab@@ se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken / applied other medicines / used recently / used , even if it is not prescription medicine .
if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means of supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means of building the immune system , such as cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ emia refers to treatment , the dose may be adjusted for about every four weeks until your condition is under control .
if necessary , your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to check the success of the treatment and make sure that the medicine works properly and your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a particular value .
as soon as you are well adjusted , you get regular doses of ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ E. / kg twice a week , spread on two equally large inj@@ ections .
if necessary , your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to check the success of the treatment and make sure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a particular value .
depending on how an@@ a@@ emia refers to treatment , the dose may be adjusted for about every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to ensure this and ensure that the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a particular value , the attending physician will conduct regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ E. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days prior to surgery , on the day of operation and another 4 days after the surgery .
however , if your doctor considers this to be appropriate , you can also learn how to squ@@ ir@@ t ab@@ se@@ amed himself under the skin .
heart , heart attacks , cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges , stroke , transi@@ ent circul@@ atory disorders of the brain , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary glands , vascular diseases ( an@@ eur@@ ys@@ m ) , thro@@ mb@@ oses of the retina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients suffering from ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment .
eyel@@ id and lips ( qu@@ ino@@ id ede@@ ma ) and shock @-@ allergic reactions with symptoms such as ting@@ ling , redness , it@@ ching , fl@@ ushing , and accelerated pulse were reported in rare cases .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ y means that no more red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Special caution when using Ab@@ se@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations it can come - irrespective of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed - to a blood cl@@ erec@@ tomy ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) .

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease which makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including those who recently suffered a low trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture as in the case of H@@ inf@@ estation ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle before the first in@@ fusion .
the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol can reduce symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headaches in the three days after the in@@ fusion .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
as the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used for the evaluation of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in the first study , nearly 8@@ ,000 elderly women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who had recently undergone a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures has been studied over a period of up to five years .
in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator of efficacy was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in the serum ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) norm@@ alized in the blood again or decreased by at least 75 % compared to bas@@ eline value .
in the study with older women , the risk of ed@@ dy frac@@ tures in patients suffering from Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis medicine ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the patients .
comparing all patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis medicine ) with those taking placebo the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients suffering from Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients taking placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days after the in@@ fusion and are less common in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ la@@ sta may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ ric acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or any of the other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at Ac@@ la@@ sta are subject to risk of kidney problems , in@@ fusion and oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( bone tissue death ) in the jaw .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta manufacturer provides clari@@ fication material for doctors who prescri@@ be Ac@@ la@@ sta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor .
April 2005 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit for the transport of Ac@@ la@@ sta across the European Union .

the patient information package is to be provided and the following key messages include : • Con@@ tract contra@@ indication in pregnancy and lac@@ t@@ ating women • Re@@ quired for adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and healthy nutrition • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to access medical or nursing assistance
treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an IV in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended for two or more weeks following the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the patient with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure an adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get twice daily at least 500@@ mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently established low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or@@ alem or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen can be reduced shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with ren@@ al function disorder ( see section 4.4 ) For patients with a Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended since limited clinical experience is available for this patient group .
elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination are similar to older patients as in younger patients .
children and adolescents are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , as data on safety and efficacy are lacking .
for patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended since only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population .
pre@@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ c@@ emia should be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D prior to the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effects of c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid to bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia develops whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure an adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get twice daily at least 500@@ mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene ) should be considered before applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment .
for patients who require dental treatment , no data is available if the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ otic ro@@ sis in the jaw area .
clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for each patient &apos;s treatment plan and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days of administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen can be reduced shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation reported in patients who received Ac@@ la@@ sta increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 from 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 out of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug interactions are listed in table 1 .
kidney function disorder , Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ utri@@ ent , was associated with ren@@ al dys@@ functions which expressed itself as a decrease in the ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ atine ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured every year before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a restricted ren@@ al function were comparable in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of the administration was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of laboratory findings , the transi@@ ent asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium levels ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were observed in 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the patients treated with the disease .
all patients received supplementary sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study , in the study on the prevention of clinical frac@@ tures following a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recent hip frac@@ ture , vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions following the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ utri@@ ent in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ otic ro@@ sis in the jaw area has been studied , especially in cancer patients , via oste@@ o@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental interfer@@ ons .
7 patients with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients treated oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area of a patient treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta and a placebo treated with placebo .
in the case of an over@@ dose which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ c@@ emia , a compensation of oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate can be achieved .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was indicated in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ S@@ core for the fem@@ al h@@ als ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture .
effects on the Ac@@ la@@ sta morph@@ ometric body frac@@ tures significantly decreased over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or several new spinal frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
patients aged 75 and older had a 60 % reduced risk of spinal frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta showed a consistent effect over three years which resulted in reduced risk for hip frac@@ tures by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased bone density in the lum@@ bar spine , hip and dist@@ al radius compared with placebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 In@@ cre@@ ase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.0 % , the lower arm by 5.@@ 1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology In 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , one year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es from the pool c@@ rest were taken .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in tra@@ bec@@ ular bone volumes and the preservation of tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture compared with placebo .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 in periods during study duration .
after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Ac@@ la@@ sta reduced significantly by 30 % compared to bas@@ eline and was maintained at 28 % below the bas@@ eline value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the bas@@ eline value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the bas@@ eline value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly ) 2 weeks before the in@@ fusion .
total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment in comparison with placebo @-@ treatment increased the BM@@ D at all times .
compared to placebo , the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % in total and 4.3 % on the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ bow .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study 5@@ 8 men were random@@ ised , and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in males ( Study C@@ ZO@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once annual administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta was not inferior to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the bas@@ eline value .
clinical effectiveness of the treatment in the disease of the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta was studied in patients and patients at the age of 30 with radi@@ ologically confirmed , mainly light to moder@@ ately heavy disease Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase equal to 2.@@ 6@@ x to 3.@@ 0@@ x age @-@ specific upper normal value when taking into the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ ric acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily for 2 months was demonstrated in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar reduction in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the bas@@ eline for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month main study ( responded to the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta and the 107 patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response was maintained in 141 of patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 71 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate in the mean follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
one @-@ off and multiple 5 and 15 minute in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ ric acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data which proved to be dose @-@ independent .
after this , the plasma level decreased rapidly to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 hours and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic dis@@ appearing from the large circulation system with half @-@ life t ½ a 0,@@ 24 and t ½ to 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a termin@@ ale elimin@@ atory period t ½ g 146 hours .
the early part phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) represent probably the rapid absorption in bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue .
the total body Clear@@ ance amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the area below the curve ( plasma concentration for time ) .
a reduced clearance of met@@ abo@@ chro@@ my P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ utri@@ ent is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in humans and because they are a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabolism @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearance of c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ ric acid cor@@ related with the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ inous @-@ Clear@@ ance , and in the 64 examined patients in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50 - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al function distur@@ b@@ ance down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ ric acid .
as for severe ren@@ al dys@@ functions ( cre@@ atine clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are available , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ le@@ thal injection intraven@@ ous single dose in mice was 10 mg / kg body weight and at rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
in trials on dogs single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the 6@@ fold of recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) were administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence .
chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ ric acid in rats was given by doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals ( a cum@@ ulative dose equivalent to the 7@@ x of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated use of cum@@ ulated expos@@ ures that exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects were observed in other organs including gastro@@ intestinal tract and liver , as well as at the intraven@@ ous injection point .
the most frequent occurrence in trials with repeated use was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the Met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of long bones in animals in the growth phase with nearly all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive action of the substance .
rats followed a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ ale ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed on rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of a low serum calcium level .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for storage time after preparation and conditions before the application ; normally , 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .

July 2007 , completed on 29 September 2006 , in the module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application application , the Pharma@@ ko@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system is in force and works before and while the product is marketed .
risk Management Plan The owner of the authorisation for the placing on the market comm@@ its to carry out the studies and additional activities to pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance , which are presented in the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan of the adopted version 00@@ 4 of the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) in module 1.@@ 8.2 of the authorisation application and all following versions of the R@@ MP approved version of the R@@ MP .
according to the CH@@ MP gui@@ deline for risk management systems for human medicines , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , which could affect current information on safety , pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance or minim@@ ization of risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days when an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) has been reached . • On request of E@@ MEA .
Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ utri@@ ent is a representative of a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the bone Pa@@ get of the bone .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens that are made of and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
with the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone reconstruction takes place too fast , and new bone material is structured random@@ ly , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ la@@ sta works by normal@@ ising the bone structure , thereby ensuring a normal bone formation and thus rein@@ forces the bone again strength .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
when using Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you have any other medicine or have taken / used recently / used , even if it is not prescription medicine .
it is particularly important for your doctor to know if you are taking the medicine that is known to damage the kidneys .
when using Ac@@ la@@ sta along with food and drinks , you should be concerned that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions , you should drink enough liquid before and after the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a vein .
if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to take the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg , which is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a vein .
because Ac@@ la@@ sta works for a long time , you may need another dose after one year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in your blood after in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment .
if the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta was missed , contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before completing the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta If you are considering the termination of treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss it with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion are very common ( in more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less common after subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headaches , occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
currently it is unclear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you have received Ac@@ la@@ sta .
physical signs because of too low calcium levels in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps or ting@@ ling or num@@ b@@ ative feeling , especially in the area around the mouth .
flu , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , fatigue , ting@@ ling / pun@@ cture , drow@@ sin@@ ess , trem@@ bling , transi@@ ent loss of consciousness , diar@@ rho@@ ea , stomach upset , itch , pain , redness , it@@ ching and pain in the eyes , chest pain , skin rash , swe@@ ating , it@@ ching , red@@ dish skin , frequent ur@@ ination , temporary increase of serum cre@@ atine , tissue damage and thirst .
persistent pain and / or healing wounds in the mouth or jaw were reported mainly in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates for other diseases .
about allergic reactions including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , was reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of these side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects not listed in this information .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions until the application ; normally , 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .
in patients with a recently @-@ l@@ itt@@ led low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , it is recommended to make the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta patients need to be sufficiently supplied with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid to bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ emia develops whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure an adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to at least twice daily 500@@ mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in patients with a recently developed low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or@@ alem or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
if you need further information about your illness or your treatment , please read the package leaf@@ let ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
A@@ comp@@ lia is also applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients , who suffer from obesity ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above and / or • which are overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond , one or more
in addition , four studies were conducted in more than 7@@ ,000 patients , in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive agent in comparison with a placebo .
on the other hand , studies on the setting of smoking showed no consistent results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess in this field of application .
what risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? it The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia , which were observed during studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) , were nausea and infections of the upper respiratory tract .
it may also not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or be treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , since it can increase the risk of depression and , among other things , can cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in a small minority of patients .
caution is advisable with simultaneous use of A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicine against fung@@ al infections ) , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for use in HIV infection ) , t@@ ep@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the efficacy of A@@ comp@@ lia in terms of weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight

A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 due to the lack of data on efficacy and safety .
La Depres@@ sive Dis@@ orders or changes in mood with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported in up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts of up to 1 % of patients who received Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the benefit of treatment in an individual case out@@ weighs the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
also in patients with no apparent risks in addition to obesity , depres@@ sive reactions can occur .
relatives or other close relatives may point out that it is necessary to monitor the new occurrence of such symptoms and seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms occur . l@@ n
• El@@ der patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown adequately .

summary of the E@@ PA@@ R for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Research Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes drug ) is not indicated .
it can be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) who cannot be satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily adjusted with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest compatible dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ ins or insulin , the present dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ ins or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ ins or insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sin@@ ks , making type 2 diabetes better .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos was studied in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , in addition , they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos launched a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg dosage .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional administration of Ac@@ tos for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ ins showed a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional dose of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study where the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was studied in 28@@ 9 patients , patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin decreased the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in the patients who took additional placebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections , weight gain and hypo@@ theses ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high concentration levels - in the blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited authorisation for the placing of accounts in the entire European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and is un@@ suitable for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) .
no data is available for use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under the age of 18 , so the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients with at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose gradually .
patients should be observed on symptoms and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with a reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients less than 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ ular vascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in reports on heart failure , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with elevated output liver enzyme ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one cannot be used .
if the AL@@ T mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme levels are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms which point to h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme levels must be checked .
the decision to continue the treatment of the patient with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be conducted by clinical evaluation until the laboratory parameters have been established .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven that can stir from fatty deposits and in some cases is associated with fluid retention .
as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a slight reduction of the mean ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under the treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
similar changes were observed in comparing controlled trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients with met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3.1 % and hem@@ at@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral tw@@ o- or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ ins or as bi@@ polar combination therapy with insulin have the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market launch , a reduction of visual acuity was reported under the treatment with thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ a , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , an occurrence or worsen@@ ing of a diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma .
it is unclear whether there is a direct link between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients report disturbances of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of un@@ desirable events concerning bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1,0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) were compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes to have pregnancy or this occurs , treatment is dep@@ rec@@ ated ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies evaluating the interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not ex@@ ert any relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with drugs which are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ sis ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
this is due to the reduction of hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia resulting in the pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal by treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one which reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
very often &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rarely &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , individual cases : unknown ( not inv@@ alu@@ able in this data ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and the refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ ege was more frequent than placebo , but less frequently than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ ins .
in an outcome study in patients with pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ ular vascular disease , the incidence of severe heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than placebo , when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one respectively .
since the market launch rarely has been reported on cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency in Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , but more often if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has been used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of reports of adverse events related to bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients treated with comparative medications was conducted .
over a period of 3.5 years running Pro@@ Active , frac@@ tures at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one were compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparison medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms oc@@ cured .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to have an activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ activation ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) , leading to increased insulin sensitivity in liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose tolerance in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ ity as mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years in order to study the time to follow the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8,0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the onset of therapy a blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,0 % ) could be maintained by means of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in 69 % of treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ ity ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient despite three months of optimi@@ zing insulin had been random@@ ized to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients suffering from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued to receive only insulin ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the treated group was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in ratio was consistently statisti@@ cally significant compared to the bas@@ eline values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small study of type 2 diabetes in a small , 18 @-@ week study .
in most clinical studies , compared to placebo , a reduction of total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels were observed as well as slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly elevated L@@ DL cholesterol levels .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ ity reduced the total plas@@ z@@ eride levels and the free fatty acids and increased HD@@ L cholesterol levels .
in comparison to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels was observed under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas low levels of met@@ form@@ in and lic@@ la@@ ity were observed .
in a 20 @-@ week study , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post @-@ di@@ aly@@ dial tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , both on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ ular vascular disease were random@@ ized in groups who received either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after or@@ ally application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , with the peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma normally 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is equivalent to the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ sis ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
after or@@ ally application of radioactive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the index ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma elimination time of un@@ modified pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active metabol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of oral clearance of the mother substance are similar .
toxic@@ ological studies were observed in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume increase with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and re@@ versi@@ bly ec@@ centri@@ cally hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e .
this is due to the reduction of hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia resulting from the treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one which reduces the mother &apos;s insulin resistance and reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) was induced by the bladder epitheli@@ um .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ a resulted in increased col@@ onic tum@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the mark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1,0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) were compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medication .
in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in were studied with respectively Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ sis .
in clinical trials over 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in ratio was statisti@@ cally significant compared to the bas@@ eline values .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post @-@ den@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , both through an effect on tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption as well as on h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ journ@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study lack@@ ed the target of its primary end@@ point , a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , coron@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization and vas@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that the intake of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not involve cardiovascular long @-@ term risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the mark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 45 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a summari@@ zing analysis of reports of adverse events related to bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients receiving comparative medications showed an increased incidence of bone frac@@ tures in women .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1,0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) were compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medication .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane is normally used once or twice daily if a rapid initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane has been studied to 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c level which suggested that blood sugar levels were similar to another human insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane need to be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the full list is to be found in the package insert ) .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane were out@@ weighed in the treatment of diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a licence for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are normally used once or twice daily if a rapid initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood glucose levels have improved significantly , for example , by intensified insulin therapy , can change the hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia &apos;s warning symptoms and should accordingly be advised .
any change concerning starch , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or production method ( re@@ combin@@ ant DNA in animal origin ) may cause a change in dosage .
if a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dosage or during the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different than with their previous insulin .
before travelling across multiple time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such journeys may lead to insulin and meals being used or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions with the therapy and ask his patients always after other drugs taken from them .
4 Un@@ less hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which can occur in a not sufficiently controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and am@@ ni@@ otic death in uter@@ o .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias can lead to loss of consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and end with temporary or permanent disturbances of the brain function and even death .
diseases of the nervous system Occ@@ a@@ sional - Periph@@ eral Neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with discomfort known as acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are usually reversible .
5 Inten@@ si@@ fying insulin therapy with ab@@ rupt improvement of blood sugar level can , however , be associated with a temporary worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic retin@@ opathy .
diseases of the skin and the sub@@ cut@@ aneous tissue Occ@@ a@@ sional - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy An injection point can develop a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy if missed to change the holes within the injection area .
general conditions and complaints at the date of performance - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions to the injection point Dur@@ ing insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma occur at the injection point ) .
diseases of the immune system Occ@@ a@@ sional - Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Ex@@ an@@ them Very rare - an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions symptoms of gener@@ alized hyper@@ sensitivity , including gener@@ alized rash , it@@ ching , swe@@ ating , gastro@@ intestinal disorders , angi@@ onic ede@@ ma , breathing difficulties , pal@@ pit@@ ations , low blood pressure and fain@@ ting / unconscious .
hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can , however , develop gradually : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias can be treated by oral supply of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
diabe@@ tics should always have grape sugar , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with loss of consciousness are treated by an in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or glucose that is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total working duration is up to 24 hours .
resor@@ ption The resor@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resor@@ ption .
a number of fis@@ sion ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split is active .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
it is recommended - after removing the Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane gas bottle from the refrigerator - the temperature of the insulin should rise to room temperature ( not over 25 ° C ) before being res@@ us@@ bed according to the instructions for use .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different than with their previous insulin .
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions with the therapy and ask his patients always after other drugs taken from them .
12 B@@ less hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which can occur in a not sufficiently controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and am@@ ni@@ otic death in uter@@ o .
13 An intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt change in blood sugar level can , however , be associated with a temporary worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic retin@@ opathy .
the termin@@ ale half @-@ life ( t ½ ) is therefore rather a measure of resor@@ ption as a measure of the elimination by se of insulin from the plasma ( insulin has a t ½ of just a few minutes in the blood@@ stream ) .

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients who are potentially hyper@@ sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of acet@@ tra@@ p@@ id may be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a licence for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the entire European Union .
if two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin that is quickly active must first be taken up , then the amount of insulin that is active .
3 If a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dosage or during the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
before travelling across multiple time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such journeys may lead to insulin and meals being used or taken at other times .
5 General diseases and complaints at the date of performance - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions to the injection point Dur@@ ing insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma occur at the injection point ) .
diabe@@ tics should always have grape sugar , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with loss of consciousness are treated by an in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or glucose that is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients who underwent major surgical procedures showed that an intraven@@ ous medication induced Nor@@ mo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar 4 - 6.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) reduced mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total working duration amounts to about 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( between 6 and 12 years ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 ) .
the data is limited , but suggests that pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .
in@@ fusion systems with acet@@ tra@@ p@@ id in concentrations 0.@@ 05 I.@@ E. / ml - 1.0 I.@@ E. / ml Insul@@ in human in the in@@ fusion fluids 0.@@ 9 % So@@ dium chlori@@ de , 5 % D @-@ glucose and 10 % D@@ - glucose with 40 m@@ mo@@ l / l potassium chlori@@ de are stable 24 hours at room temperature for 24 hours .
11 If a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the adjustment .
before travelling across multiple time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such journeys may lead to insulin and meals being used or taken at other times .
13 General diseases and complaints at the date of performance - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions to the injection point Dur@@ ing insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma occur at the injection point ) .
diabe@@ tics should always have grape sugar , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with loss of consciousness are treated by an in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or glucose that is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( between 6 and 12 years ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 ) .
the intraven@@ ous application of ac@@ qui@@ p@@ id from finished pens or cartridges should be an exception and only take place in situations where no pier@@ cing bottles are available .
if a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the adjustment .

this can happen : • if you inj@@ ecting too much insulin , if you eat too little or leave a meal • if you do more than otherwise physically
always set your Nov@@ o@@ Let finish cap when it is not in use to protect it from light .
remove the rubber membrane with a medical t@@ amp@@ on • always use a new injection needle for each injection to avoid contamination . • Rem@@ ove the injection needle straight and firmly on Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let ( Fig@@ ure A ) • Dra@@ g the large outer cap of the injection needle and the inner cap of the injection needle .
proceed as follows to avoid the injection of air and ensure proper dosage : • Ke@@ ep Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let with the injection needle upward • kno@@ ck a few times with the finger slightly against the cartridge .
when air bubbles are present , they will collect them up in the cartridge • Whi@@ le the injection needle continues to hold up , turn the cartridge into the direction of the arrow ( Fig@@ ure B ) • Whi@@ le the injection needle continues pointing upwards , press the push button entirely ( Fig@@ ure C ) • Now , a drop of insulin must be taken out of the tip of the injection needle .
• Set the cap back to the finished pen so that the number 0 stands opposite the metering brand ( Fig@@ ure D ) • Check that the push button is pressed entirely .
if the push button cannot move freely , insulin is pressed out of the injection needle • The scale on the cap shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units .
the push button moves outward , while you turn the closing cap • The scale underneath the push button ( push button scale ) shows 20 , 40 and 60 units .
107 • Record the highest number you can see on the push@@ button • Ad@@ ding the two numbers to get the set dose • If you have set a wrong dose , simply turn the cap forward or backwards , until you have set the correct number of units .
turn it until the push @-@ button is down and you feel a resistance then take off the cap and set it up again so that the 0 of the metering brand is opposite .
make sure to press on the push button only during the injection • Ke@@ ep pressed the button after the injection until the needle is pulled out of the skin .
it may not be accurate • You can &apos;t set a dose that is higher than the number of units remaining in the cartridge • You can use the remaining range scale to estimate how much insulin is still left , but you can &apos;t use them to adjust or select your dose .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients showing signs of cryst@@ alli@@ zation , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or pla@@ gues ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger urine crystals that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid levels are still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once daily .
there are still some cases of rheum@@ atism during the first treatment months , which is why it is recommended that the patients take further medicines for the prevention of rheum@@ atism at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic .
the drug is not recommended for children and for patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study , involving 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different Aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with that of a placebo ( placebo ) and allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine used to treat hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia ) .
in the second study two dos@@ ages of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied at a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose urine acid levels were below 6 mg / dl for the last three measurements .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of the patients who took Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who took 120 mg once daily , had a urine acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of patients with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 subjects under placebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rhea , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver enzymes .
especially in patients with heart problems in pre@@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic could be more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already resulted in plaque formation ( including a rheum@@ at@@ ology and / or rheum@@ atism , known from the medical history ) .
if the level of serum res@@ ins is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken into consideration at AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily .
efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated in patients with severe ren@@ al function ( Cre@@ at@@ inous Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
since there are no experiences with children and adolescents , the use of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended .
since there are no experiences with organ transplan@@ t receivers , the use of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group ( see section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure , treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other res@@ inous drugs , a acute attack can occur during the treatment , because the lowering of the serum resin acid can initially mobili@@ ze ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissue .
B. in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment ( Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases increases so far that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver diseases Dur@@ ing phase 3 clinical trials , minor signs of liver function values were observed in patients treated with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before beginning the f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ at treatment and in the course of the course ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine z@@ ine did not conduct any interaction studies on F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ lic acid ( an inhibit@@ ing of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects , F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen were also associated with an increase in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without the need for a dose adjustment for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient used at the same time .
in a study with subjects 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x had an average 22 % increase in AU@@ C from Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acids containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de has slow@@ ed the absorption of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a decrease in C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C .
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies may not close to side effects of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal studies do not cause direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , serving machines or in the exercise of dangerous activities until they can reasonably be sure that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of the cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the overall f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extension studies ( 1,4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were ar@@ teri@@ os@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency in the medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects , which could be found in the treatment groups of 80 mg / 120 mg of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which were reported more than once in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups , are listed below .
diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In clinical trials there were no serious r@@ ashes or serious hyper@@ sensitivity reactions observed .
7 Off@@ ered long @-@ term extension studies In open long @-@ term extension studies , 90@@ 6 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years long , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients up to 4 years long with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events related to long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported more than once in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups and occurred in patients who received F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to information occasionally .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency :
diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , in@@ som@@ nia , p@@ es@@ thesia , conspic@@ uous EC@@ G , cou@@ ghing , bur@@ si@@ tis , protein ur@@ ie , ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , erectile dysfunction , increase in the concentration of potassium in the blood , increase in lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , decrease in the number of white blood cells .
the mechanism of active ur@@ ic acid is the end product of the pur@@ in@@ metabolism in humans and arises as part of the reaction sk@@ ade hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → Te@@ ur@@ ic acid .
F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a potent , non @-@ pur@@ in @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for in vitro Hem@@ p which lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range .
clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( A@@ PE@@ X study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ sow@@ ings levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a serum cre@@ atine value at the start of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the A@@ PE@@ X study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with commonly used doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in both treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared with the conventional dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were combined for the analyses . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus 80 mg
lowering the serum resin acid level to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor visit in week 2 and maintained permanently throughout the treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum cre@@ atine values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl were given 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al function restriction The A@@ PE@@ X study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with ren@@ al function restriction ( D ) .
AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was the primary efficacy end@@ point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of ser@@ um@@ ina acid concentrations in subjects , irrespective of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum res@@ ins ≥ 10 mg / dl of E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( A@@ PE@@ X and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum resin concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study ( bas@@ eline ) .
the data from the open extension study of Phase 3 revealed in two years that the permanent reduction of serum resin levels was reduced to &lt; 6@@ mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients needed a treatment against rheum@@ atism in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not need treatment against a supply of toxins ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the bur@@ r , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete disappearance of the k@@ not no@@ des by month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5,@@ 0 % ) and receiving Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose is dose @-@ proportional .
for doses of 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is larger than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking single or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5,@@ 0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease in serum resin concentration , provided this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent steady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) by F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma binding of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding of alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width , which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ scopy showed that these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are mainly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly caused by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose in the urine was found to be un@@ altered fi@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as further unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , about 45 % of the dose in the stool was found to be un@@ altered fi@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as further unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ MA@@ x of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change compared to subjects with normal kidney function .
the mean total AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by about 1.8 times of 7.5 μ of 7.5 μ y / ml in the group with normal kidney function at € 13.@@ 2 μ contin@@ h / ml in the group with severe kidney function .

these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ in@@ metabolism and ur@@ inary composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it was found that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on the fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .
at high doses , which were about 3 times the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred which accompanied by lowering the re@@ aring performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats .
ter@@ at@@ ological studies in supporting rats with ex@@ positions , which approximately the 4.3 @-@ fold and in tra@@ fic rabbit with ex@@ positions , which amounted to approximately 13 times the human therapeutic exposure , did not reveal any ter@@ ato@@ genic effects .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disorder in which the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause , where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irritation of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient must not lie down until after the first dietary intake of the day , which should take place earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
as al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union , the company presented data originating from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to prove the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of enhancing vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who received al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data suggest@@ ing that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose required for the prevention of bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are headaches , pain of the locom@@ otor system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of digestive problems such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( digestive disorders ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , diar@@ rhea ( ul@@ cer@@ ation ) , vom@@ iting ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , dri@@ lled abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated stomach ) as well as aci@@ dic re@@ aring .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other components AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE must not be applied .
it must not be applied to diseases of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit for the merger of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE across the European Union to the Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd. company .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following information should be followed precisely to reduce the risk of oste@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and related side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth as there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer@@ ation , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical interventions in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract , except for p@@ yl@@ or@@ oplas@@ tic , can only be given under special caution ( see section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ ations and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al frac@@ tures , were reported in patients taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( partially these were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible oste@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be advised to susp@@ end pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn , or seek medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe malign@@ ant adverse events appears to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or continue to take it after the appearance of symptoms that point to oste@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
although no increased risk was found in large @-@ scale clinical studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cers , some of which were severe and associated with complications , were reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ men were predominantly administered intraven@@ ously and bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there are no data available which indicate whether the removal of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who require a s@@ late surgical procedure decreases the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
clinical evaluation by the treating physician is decisive for the planning of therapy for each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that they should take a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE on the next morning after they have noticed their failure to take a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet per week as originally planned for the scheduled day of the week .
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated adequately before treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time .
therefore , after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not conducted , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken in clinical trials , together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines , without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for the use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or lac@@ t@@ ating women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most of the reports stem from cancer patients , but it was also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
nevertheless , the serum cal@@ ci@@ ums showed up to &lt; 8,0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosphor@@ us up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at In@@ following an oral over@@ dose may occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract , such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .

after 15 weeks of treatment , the mean serum levels of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ Vitamin D were significantly higher ( 26 % ) in the group under AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ E. ) ( 56 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 23 ng / ml &#93; ) than in the group under Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at alone ( 46 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 18,@@ 2 ng / ml &#93; ) .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ E. ) significantly lowered the proportion of patients with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency ( serum level of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ Vitamin D &lt; 37@@ ,5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 ng / ml &#93; ) by 6@@ 2.5 % compared to Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at alone ( 12 % vs ) .
the therapeutic simil@@ arity of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at once a week 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 m@@ g. a day ( n = 370 ) was demonstrated in a one @-@ year multic@@ enter study of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two Phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in the phase III studies , the average intake of BM@@ D with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spinal column , 5.@@ 9 % on the Fem@@ ural H@@ als and 7.@@ 8 % on the Tro@@ chan@@ ter .
in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % compared to placebo 6.2 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more spinal frac@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the BM@@ D of the BM@@ D of the spinal column and the Tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to hold ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the whole body was maintained .
it consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled trials , in which Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and subsequently 10 m@@ g. daily either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study the daily administration of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the incidence of at least one new ed@@ dy frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % versus placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
resor@@ ption Based on an intraven@@ ous reference dose , the medi@@ al bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women was 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after night fasting and two hours before taking a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy volunteers the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day over five days ) did not lead to any clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 Distribution of rats have shown that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is distributed temporarily into soft tissue after IV administration of 1 mg / kg , but then rapidly re@@ circul@@ ated into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine .
elimination After IV administration of a single dose of 14@@ C Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , about 50 % of the radio@@ actively marked substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the fung@@ us .
after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and systemic clearing did not exceed 200 ml / min .
in rats , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kidneys via the aci@@ dic or alkal@@ ine transport system and therefore it is not assumed that the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs is influenced by these transport systems .

ex@@ cre@@ tion In case of radio@@ actively br@@ anded vitamin D@@ 3 in healthy subjects , the absence of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours was 2.4 % , in the cases after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % .
characteristics in patients with prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not deposited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via the urine .
although there is no clinical data available , it is still expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal studies will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
for this reason , a somewhat higher cum@@ ulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in the bones is expected in patients with reduced kidney function ( see section 4.2 ) .

an@@ agra@@ f is administered to adult patients who have been transplan@@ ted a kidney or liver to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organs by the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company presented the results of previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical trial were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplantation , compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rejected after a treatment duration of one year ( for example , by examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , shorter further studies were performed on 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplantation and examined how Adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body in comparison with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other components , Adv@@ agra@@ f cannot be applied .
patients and doctors need to be careful if other ( especially some herbal ) medicines are taken concur@@ r@@ ently with Adv@@ agra@@ f as the dose or dose of the drug taken at the same time must be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes of the formulation or regime should only be undertaken under close supervision of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of a change to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug control and corresponding dose adap@@ tations must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is maintained .
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in an individual case and on blood levels ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
following change@@ over from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ ph , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m tal@@ levels should be checked before the change@@ over and over two weeks after conversion .
day 4 was the systemic exposure , measured as a talent level , with both form@@ ulations comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus talk levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation into an@@ agra@@ f to ensure proper substance exposure during the immediate night transplan@@ t phase .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a low Clear@@ ance substance , an adjustment of the dose can take several days before the steady state is reached .
if the condition of the patient does not allow oral dosage of medicines in the first postoperative period , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment may be initiated intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of the application For the suppression of the gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dose recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
further dose adap@@ tations may be necessary later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change during the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after the transplan@@ t .
dose recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f Is a gra@@ ft recipient of twice daily dosage of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to be converted to a once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ f , so this conversion in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose , has to take place .
after switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Adv@@ agra@@ f once a day , the treatment with the oral initi@@ al@@ dehy@@ de recommended in K@@ id@@ ney and liver transplantation must commen@@ ce for the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of the gra@@ ft rejection .
heart transplantation In adult patients who are switched to Adv@@ agra@@ ph , an oral Initi@@ al dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is to be taken once a day in the morning .
other transplan@@ t recipients , although there is no clinical experience with Adv@@ agra@@ f in lung , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ec@@ tal patients , was used in a oral initi@@ als dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day for transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adap@@ tations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood flow in the targeted area , a reduction of the dose may be required in patients with severe liver function disorders .
patients with reduced kidney function Sin@@ ce the ren@@ al function does not ex@@ ert an influence on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , careful observation of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ accuracy , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ inc@@ al@@ ance and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
switching from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ine to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is recommended ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dosage ought to be based primarily on the clinical assessment of re@@ pul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in an individual case with the aid of thorou@@ gh@@ bred tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ levels controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ ks during the first two weeks following transplantation , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ tal@@ low levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after change@@ over from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ ph , Dos@@ age adjustments , changes of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or while applying substances that could change the blood concentration of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , adjustments to the dose may require several days until the steady state has occurred .
the indications in clinical studies indicate that successful treatment in most cases is possible if the tal@@ levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the whole blood are usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in case of kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t receivers , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml have generally been used .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects which may occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dor@@ sal or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes of the formulation or regime should only be undertaken under close supervision of a medical device experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection associated with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive drugs , no clinical data is available for the ret@@ arded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f .
for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and recipients of transplan@@ t recipients , no clinical data is available for the ret@@ arded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f .
because of possible interactions that may lead to a lowering of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the use of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other herbal remedies during treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ ph ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful observation of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is provided because the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations .
in rare cases , a corneal or sep@@ tum hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e referred to as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy has been observed , which can therefore occur under Adv@@ agra@@ ph .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart condition , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the potential risk of malign@@ ant skin les@@ ions due to appropriate clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor .
if patients taking Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as headaches , altered state of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and visual disturbances should show a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption , Adv@@ agra@@ f Hart@@ cap , ret@@ ard@@ ant , contains lac@@ tose .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and consequently increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels while offering substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A &apos;s metabolism and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain even concentrations according to sections 4.2 and 4.4 .
a highly distinctive interaction was achieved with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , i@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly resulted from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly d@@ osed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ Hem@@ mer ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed with medicines which are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 which interfer@@ es with their metabolism .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormon@@ al exposure , precau@@ tionary measures are especially cau@@ tious .
the results of animal studies have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus could potentially reduce the clearing of pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ one and pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients have no indication that under tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( in particular with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of a premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a new@@ born hyper@@ alkal@@ ine ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive drugs can often not be determined precisely because of the patient &apos;s underlying disease and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
subsequently , the side effects are listed according to their frequency in descending order : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , not known ( frequency based on available data is not predictable ) .

infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases As is known to be with other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , the suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , proto@@ zo@@ als ) is frequently increased in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
cases of BK @-@ virus @-@ associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy , including therapy with Adv@@ agra@@ ph .
ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V @-@ associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tumours were reported in conjunction with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma rot@@ eins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ sis .
mechanism of action and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects On the molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should be medi@@ ated by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ean protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the connection within the cellular nucle@@ us .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent inhibit@@ ing of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ cytes genes .
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus op@@ presses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , and the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cytes ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) and the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

175 patient @-@ transplan@@ ted patients , in 4@@ 75 patients who underwent pancre@@ atic transplantation and in 6@@ 30 cases after an intestinal transplan@@ t were used as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant .
overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies was consistent with the large studies in which pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , ren@@ al and heart transplan@@ t recipients .
lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multic@@ entre study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f , more than 110 patients were reported to either receive Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in within 1 : 1 random@@ ization .
chronic transplantation , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis ob@@ liter@@ acy syndrome , was also observed less frequently in the first year after the transplan@@ t ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it came in 21.@@ 7 % of cases for the development of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed by Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which no acute gra@@ ft rejection occurred after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the lung transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study the frequency of the emergence of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis ob@@ liter@@ ated syndrome was significantly lower in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
pancre@@ atic transplantation A multi @-@ center trial with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was performed on 205 patients who simultaneously underwent pancre@@ atic and kidney transplantation , which were random@@ ised to receive Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initi@@ al@@ dosage ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to reach the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml am 5 .
in 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ine , 75 liver and intest@@ ine and 25 mul@@ tiv@@ is@@ zer@@ ale transplan@@ ts ) showed an up @-@ to @-@ date survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .
methods for early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ row enlargement , additional dose of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 antagon@@ ist d@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , lower initial doses of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ zumab , leading to seb@@ as@@ say between 10 and 15 ng / ml and recently gra@@ ft radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , An@@ n Sur@@ g 2001 ; 2@@ 34 : 40@@ 4 ) .
factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t value and low protein concentrations , which lead to an increase in the un@@ bound fraction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of metabolism caused by cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for the higher Clear@@ ance rates observed after transplantation .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , with ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly via bile .
the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ agra@@ ph was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f for stable patients who were switched from Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) to Adv@@ agra@@ f ( once daily ) in relation to the total daily dose .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ ks during the first two weeks following transplantation , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .
21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection associated with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive drugs , no clinical data is available for the ret@@ arded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart condition , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma .
28 confirmed acute out@@ breaks were 3@@ 2,@@ 6 % in the first 24 weeks in the Adv@@ agra@@ f Group ( N = 2@@ 37 ) and 29.@@ 3 % in the Pro@@ gra@@ f Group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) .

advances will be used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application determine whether adv@@ ate is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ots problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but produced according to a method known as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , enabling it to form the human cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II .
advice is similar to another in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is otherwise made , so that the medicine does not contain any proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the use of the drug for the prevention of bleeding as well as in surgical procedures was investigated .
in the main study , the effectiveness of advoc@@ ates in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood cells was awarded &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ances ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VI@@ II .
advice may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein , or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted the Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a licence for the placing of lawyers in the whole of the European Union .
dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , the location and extent of the bleeding and the patient &apos;s clinical condition .
in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor VI@@ II activity in the corresponding period should not fall below the indicated plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients less than 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until pain and acute impairment are eliminated .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients less than 6 years ) repeat until the risk for the patient is over .
during the treatment course , appropriate determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma levels is recommended to control the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections .
individual patients can differ in their response to factor VI@@ II , achieve different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times .
3 Pro@@ phyla@@ xis To the long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight should be given at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor of VI@@ II plasma activities is not reached or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed to detect an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered .
the administration speed should depend on the patient &apos;s condition whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VI@@ II is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II @-@ directed Ig@@ G immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by modified Be@@ thes@@ da as@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to the factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is the greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in previously untreated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an am@@ n@@ estic known inhibit@@ or development , a re@@ combin@@ ant Factor VI@@ II product was observed on another , the recur@@ rence of ( low @-@ depres@@ sive ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A in women there are no experiences about the application of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors of factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all of which had previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of forming inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( each 3 patients ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ egels was performed post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the Factor VI@@ II@@ - Mir@@ ror in the plasma and the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE on 145 children and adults 2 with a severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to Factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or@@ ti@@ ter after 26 exposure days with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
in addition , no one of 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed with moderate to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) was diagnosed with a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or after previous exposure to Factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) .
previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical trial were 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE inhibit@@ ors to factor VI@@ II .
the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by the antibody ti@@ ter &apos;s examination against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a sustained peak of the antibody level against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indic@@ ative of an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the incidence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophi@@ lic gran@@ u@@ loc@@ y@@ tes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions during the study .

special caution when using A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE is required you should inform your doctor if you have recently been treated with Factor VI@@ II products especially if you have developed inhibit@@ ors .
these symptoms can present early signs of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic sho@@ cks which can include the following symptoms : extreme di@@ zz@@ iness , loss of consciousness and extreme breathing difficulties .
if you use other medicines , please inform your doctor if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is non @-@ prescription medicine .
your doctor will calculate your dose of A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE ( in international units or I.@@ U. ) depending on your physical condition and body weight , and whether it is used to prevent or treat bleeding .

based on the data available since the initial authorisation , the CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefit @-@ risk assessment as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE &apos;s safety profile , which necess@@ it@@ ates filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , so that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ec@@ ular Limited announced to the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company will withdraw its application for the approval of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Cancer .
usually , however , the chest , the brain , the bones or the soft parts ( tissue that connects and supports other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has been modified so that there are no copies of themselves and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
adv@@ ex@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors , enabling cancer cells to recre@@ ate the normal p@@ 53 protein once more .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the non @-@ defective p@@ 53 gene existing in the human body , usually contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be restored .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , in which the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 @-@ protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide .
the company presented data from a study with a patient who appeared at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer in the area of the under@@ belly , bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP checked the answers of the company to the questions asked him , some questions were still unclear .
based on the evaluation of the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company by day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently proved that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors benefits patients .
the committee also had concerns about the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company has not sufficiently proved that adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not inform the CH@@ MP about whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Com@@ bat @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed drug release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly over several hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of the seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , an allergy to pol@@ len caused by pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents 12 years of age , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet , which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are c@@ logged .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy was the changes in the severity of hay fever symptoms , which were reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all hay fever symptoms , besides the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , patients who received aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a 4@@ 6.0 % decrease in the symptoms compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients taking Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
when only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients with Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a decrease of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine used to treat allergies ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should also not be used in patients who suffer from a con@@ genital glaucoma ( elevated intra@@ ocular pressure ) , cardiac or vascular disease including hypertension ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( cereb@@ ral isch@@ emia ) or a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the placing of the Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze on the whole of the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it is whole to swallow ( i.e. without dis@@ assembling , breaking or chew@@ ing ) .
due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) , Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms decay .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , since the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine may decrease over time during long @-@ term applications .
after the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes in the upper respiratory passages , treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as mon@@ otherapy if necessary .
as Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within 2 weeks after termination of such treatment .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , Per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ olin , erg@@ ot@@ amine , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ g@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tives that are performed in oral or nas@@ al as a drop of Rhin@@ opla@@ sty ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function disorder and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that treatment in case of hypertension or ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as headaches or ampli@@ fication of headache ) must be removed .
in the treatment of the following patient groups , caution is advised : • Pati@@ ents with cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with hypertension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder and bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before the implementation of der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce them to their extent .
in clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor tests showed no significant differences between the patients treated with lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the patients treated with placebo , regardless of whether they were taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
in @-@ vitro studies , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 drug is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the harm@@ lessness of the application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities as compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproductive studies of animals cannot always be transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze should not be applied during pregnancy .
patients should , however , be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to a di@@ zz@@ iness that may lead to impairment of the per@@ spir@@ ation or the ability to operate machinery .
the symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible le@@ aking procedures .
headaches , anxiety , ag@@ grav@@ ating mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , con@@ genital pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual disturbances and hypertension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia .
a CN@@ S stimulation is most likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( dry mouth , pup@@ il rigi@@ dity and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the in@@ hibition of release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ e@@ ophil@@ s as well as the inhibit@@ ing of the expression of the P @-@ selection on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose trial with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg per day .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine at recommended dosage can cause further li@@ ke@@ able effects , such as increasing blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestation of CN@@ S exc@@ itation .
there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined based on the overall scores for symptoms ( except for nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling ) , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of age , age or eth@@ ni@@ city .
in a single dose trial on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after the plasma is administered .
after the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow equ@@ ation of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose trial , which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were poorly metabol@@ ised .
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) from pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the exclusive application of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine is bio@@ equivalent after exposure to an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
however , based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n cannot be identified with particular risks to humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg per day and on rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
in March 2007 and in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application application , the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance that can un@@ fold its effect .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and tear@@ ing or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .

tell your doctor if you encounter or diagnose the following symptoms or illnesses under the use of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • high blood pressure • heart ch@@ ase , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations • Cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea and headaches or intensi@@ fying existing headaches .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
use in the recommended dosage is not to be expected that aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze leads to di@@ zz@@ iness or decreases attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
if you have forgotten the intake of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze If you forgot to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the intended time .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects listed you significantly affects or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information .

after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n very rarely has been reported cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin rash .
cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ ase , abdominal pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhea , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sleep disturbances , muscle pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , cases of inflammation of the liver and cases of conspic@@ uous liver promin@@ ence has also been reported very rarely .
it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 mg / ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate for taking ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake .
for children at the age of one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once daily , in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup .
for children between 6 and 11 years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in 5 ml sy@@ rup or 5 ml sy@@ rup .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies involving approximately 4,@@ 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four trials for seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies of patients who also had asthma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ r@@ cles , impaired sleep , and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been submitted to verify that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution for taking and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , if the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the symptom scores ( symptom score ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the reduction of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving a placebo .
in the two studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in the symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to 40 and 33 % in the patients treated with placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the placing of A@@ eri@@ us across the European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , for allevi@@ ating symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience in clinical trials for efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be performed according to the previous disease process and can be terminated following the decay of the symptoms and resum@@ ed during re@@ occurring .
allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have not been found in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , alcohol does not increase the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
patients should , however , be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to di@@ zz@@ iness , which may lead to impairment of the per@@ spir@@ ation or the ability to operate machinery .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo was ti@@ redness ( 1,2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
a clinical trial involving 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients from 12 to 17 years was the most common side effect of headaches . this occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose trial administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dosage ) .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ e@@ ophil@@ s as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the P @-@ selection of the P @-@ sel@@ tin on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
as part of a clinical study with multiple doses given to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( nine times the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval proved .
in a single dose trial with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nose @-@ secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tear and red@@ dening of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown by the overall scores of the questionnaire on quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria has been investigated as representative for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , regardless of ae@@ ti@@ ology , is similar in the different forms , and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited more easily .
since hist@@ am@@ ination is a caus@@ ative factor in all caus@@ al diseases , it is expected that in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n will also lead to an improvement in the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and reducing the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in the case of chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study .
improvement of the itch by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wak@@ efulness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patient @-@ demo@@ s were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after a daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not entirely ruled out .

in a single dose trial with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dosage of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , low @-@ cal@@ orie breakfast ) did not affect the availability of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies performed with lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , for allevi@@ ating symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see Section 4.4 ) and that there is no data available to support a treatment of an infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and corresponding laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabol@@ ise des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience higher substance strain ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Si@@ rup in children between the ages of 2 and 11 , which is met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to that of children that met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze normally .
this medication contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol , so patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems should not take this medicine with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose in@@ suffici@@ ency .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have not been found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Si@@ rup group as in the placebo group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than those treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose trial in adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dosage ) .
children aged between 1 and 11 , who were eligible for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used for up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( nine times the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days in adults , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval proved .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was found at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents .
at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents reported no impairment of psych@@ om@@ otor therapy in adults and adolescents .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies of adults , alcohol @-@ induced performance impairment was neither increased nor increased drow@@ sin@@ ess due to the simultaneous intake of alcohol .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nose @-@ secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tear and red@@ dening of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown by the overall scores of the questionnaire on quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the induced seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and reducing the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this restricted met@@ alli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ dose trial with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s which are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
the loading ( AU@@ C ) through Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of about 120 hours .
there are no clu@@ es for clin@@ ically relevant drug con@@ ges@@ tion following a daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 single dose trials showed that AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x levels of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were comparable to pa@@ edi@@ atric patients at the recommended doses with those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup at a dosage of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is offered in type III brown bottles with a child @-@ safe polypropylene inter@@ connection cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

clin@@ ically relevant interactions have not been found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally used ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 m@@ g. daily with A@@ eri@@ us tablets than in patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose trial , where up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) were used , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
in two single dose trials , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at was tolerated well ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data .
as part of a clinical study with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .

in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg per day .
in a 17 single dose trial with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measuring parameters of the flight performance , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nose @-@ secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tear and red@@ dening of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown by the overall scores of the questionnaire on quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .

there is limited experience in clinical trials for efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately prior to the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melting tray must be removed without damaging them .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven yet .
the overall incidence of adverse events between the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the placebo group was the same and did not significantly devi@@ ate from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
at the recommended dosage , A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets proved to be the bio@@ equivalent of the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at for the inclusion of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
as part of a clinical study with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically
in a single dose trial with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
the spread of this badly met@@ alli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients ( 18 % , children 16 % ) greater than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( A@@ wak@@ ening 2 % , children 3 % ) , but the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population .

the overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to that of the placebo group .
in infants aged between 6 and 23 months , the most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo reported diar@@ rhea ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2.3 % ) .
in an additional study , no side effects were observed in patients at the age between 6 and 11 years at a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution .
the recommended doses were the plasma concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) in the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was found at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may also occur in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms .
as shown by the overall scores of the questionnaire on quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the spread of this restricted met@@ alli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
since A@@ eri@@ us contains the same concentration of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no bio@@ equi@@ valence study was necessary and it is expected that it corresponds to the sy@@ rup and the tablets .
various single @-@ dose studies showed that the AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were comparable to pa@@ edi@@ atric patients at the recommended doses with those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup at a dosage of 5 mg .

in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. has officially announced that the company re@@ jects its application for the authorisation of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that is intended to protect from a strain of influenza virus that could cause future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new trunk of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from man to man , because people have no immunity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as &quot; alien &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system will later be able to develop antibodies quickly in a contact with a flu virus .
subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognizes as a body alien ) , was puri@@ fied and used as a constitu@@ ent of the vaccine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a survey of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the amount of clinical data base for assessing the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
should you take part in a clinical trial and require further information on your treatment , please contact your doctor .
for further information on the basis of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immuno@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immuno@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who do not swallow the capsules , A@@ gener@@ a is available as a solution to take in , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the safety of this combination has not been investigated .
it should only be administered if the doctor has checked which anti@@ viral medicines the patient has previously taken and the likel@@ ihood of the virus being addressed to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other anti@@ viral medicines .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ bo@@ omer@@ ase after body weight is directed .
in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , A@@ regeneration reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
not to cure AIDS , however , can delay damage to the immune system and thereby also the development of AIDS @-@ related infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
this medicine , which was enhanced with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who had previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the viral load change after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously had no prot@@ e@@ as@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , after 48 weeks in A@@ gener@@ a more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml than placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ a also reduced the viral load , but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ase inhibit@@ ors were very few .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , this medicine led by Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r strengthened the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it came under A@@ gener@@ a together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to increase the viral load after four weeks than with the patients who continued to take their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gen@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) include headaches , diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ rec@@ ase should not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicinal products , which are broken down as well as ag@@ glomer@@ ate and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , there is the risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors out@@ weigh the risks for over four years .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee found that the benefit of am@@ n@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously taken no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as limited information was available at the time of authorisation for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Gla@@ xo Group Limited authorisation for the transport of nuclear gases across the European Union .
A@@ gen@@ ase is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ treated adults and children aged 4 years .
usually , as@@ generic capsules are to be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sters of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for taking up is 14 % less than am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; hence , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are applied without the rein@@ forcing addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of A@@ regeneration ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ generic ase in combination with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not investigated in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily .
the concur@@ rent application should be taken care of in patients with mild or moderate liver function disorder , in patients with severe liver function disorder , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
it should not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also present sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be applied because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that ast@@ ral or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with A@@ regeneration , does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , A@@ gr@@ ase capsules are to be used together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome .
for the case of a simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please refer to the specific information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing reduced liver function , including chronic @-@ active hepatitis , show increased frequency of h@@ ep@@ atic dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ per@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , which are metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oidal effects including C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al kidney function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of ast@@ ral with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended due to the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines which may cause serious or life threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International standard ised ratio ) , methods for determining drug concentration are available .
in patients taking these drugs at the same time , A@@ regeneration may be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
because of the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the efficacy of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r at the same time , patients should be monitored for withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
because of the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col@@ ide content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this dosage form is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with care in certain other patient populations .
a rash should be set for 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported to have diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases requiring medication to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it .
in h@@ ein@@ ophil@@ ous patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneously cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis occur .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can develop at the time of initi@@ ating an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , leading to severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing symptoms .
although multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is adopted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width are not allowed to be given at the same time as medicines with a low therapeutic width and also present sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be given together with medicines whose active substances are metabol@@ ised mainly via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects for the elevated plasma levels .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r leading to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance to resistance .
in the attempt to compensate the lower plasma levels by supple@@ menting other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver were observed very frequently .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of plant preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient has already taken St. John &apos;s wort , the Am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus mirrors and , if possible , to check the viral load and remove the St. John &apos;s wort .
dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not required if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % increased , by contrast , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x when rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme .
52 % lower if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were obtained twice daily in the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered twice daily .
dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but a close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed surveillance is recommended , as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ sis in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , but due to the an@@ ta@@ sis component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase differ at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , no dose adjustment is required in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effect of ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may precip@@ itate the serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised as Del@@ a@@ vir@@ on could be less effective because of the decreased or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
careful clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be performed , as an exact pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin resulted in an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % and thus an increase in side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dosage , although there is no clinical data available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , however , the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) increased to 2.@@ 69@@ x compared to the value observed after 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without concur@@ rent application of F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may lead to interactions if they are used together with a generic nose .
the patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicines , if they are used in combination with as@@ per@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advised that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da is not taken at the same time as ather@@ os@@ clerosis since it can result in resor@@ ption problems .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ ants known as enzyme ad@@ duc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r may result in degradation of the plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ p@@ am@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ p@@ am@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ p@@ am@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ p@@ am@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ p@@ am@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ p@@ am@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ p@@ am@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ p@@ am@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ p@@ am@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ p@@ am@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ p@@ am@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ p@@ am@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ p@@ am@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ p@@ am@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@
simultaneous intake of A@@ gener@@ ase can greatly increase their plasma concentrations and increase the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times per day ) more than 7 days on subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous administration of am@@ per@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oidal effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
with H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases in plasma levels can be expected concur@@ r@@ ently with A@@ gener@@ ase .
since plasma @-@ level increases of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including a hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirror is recommended , as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with the same dose of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase should not be used together with oral mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while with simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am , caution is advised .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
because of the very low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation to adjust the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus dose if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is given at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with simultaneous dispens@@ ing of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with ather@@ os@@ clerosis , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended due to the possibility of weak@@ ening or ampli@@ fication of the anti @-@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of additional administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example , Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time as A@@ rec@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this drug may be used only after careful weighing of the possible benefit for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven in the milk of lac@@ tation rats , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the implant@@ ation in the uter@@ us up to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight during the lac@@ tation period .
the further development of descendants , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother @-@ animal .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gen@@ ase was investigated in adults and in children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , early on and rarely resulted in the treatment of treatment .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are in connection with the intake of A@@ gen@@ ase or another at the same time as HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ase inhibit@@ ors not received 200 mg of A@@ regeneration twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) evaluated by investig@@ ators as related to the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of patients , as well as in the treatment of occurring laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and multiple sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of breasts and dor@@ so@@ cereb@@ ral fat accumulation .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non pre@@ treated individuals who had been treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine for a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( stit@@ ches ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , in 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre@@ treated patients treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
skin r@@ ashes were usually moderate to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ phi@@ c nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred usually during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be broken off .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can develop at the time of initi@@ ating an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
with PI treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ regeneration twice daily with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Grade 3 and 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) , which were observed under any am@@ using treatment , were very common in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase along with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of an over@@ dose , the patient must observe signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary support measures .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents viral G@@ ag@@ - and ga@@ g @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ log @-@ prec@@ ur@@ sors by forming un@@ ripe , non @-@ infectious viral particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro to HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was investigated in both acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells .
the connection between the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dosage , as in other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral patients who received 100@@ mg of F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 trial , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates being gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of 13 out of 14 children , where a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 enrolled patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , E@@ 34@@ Q , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , I@@ 54@@ L / M / T / V , A@@ 7@@ 1@@ V , V@@ 77@@ I , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M .
in the AP@@ V@@ 3@@ 000@@ 3 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day : n = 107 ) with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors occurred in patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / S / T / V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with an increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced likel@@ ihood of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for estim@@ ating the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that market diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( separation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns produces a certain cross resistance against rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to ind@@ in@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r , and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data on cross resistance between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre@@ treated patients , in which a resistance against Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , ind@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and zo@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) can be called forth .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early termination of a failing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits , which can affect the subsequent treatment adver@@ sely .
the test@@ ament to the efficacy of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which PI treated adults after vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ osi@@ dan@@ alo@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , mainly with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred thre@@ es@@ core and sixty ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gen@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 Study .
the primary analysis demonstrated the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , in a non @-@ cap@@ illary threshold of 0.4 logical copies / ml .
the proof of the efficacy of un@@ banned aspir@@ ation is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children at the age of 2 to 18 years , of which 152 had been pre @-@ treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase solution was used for intake and capsules in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily .
no low dose det@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together .
after 48 weeks , about 25 % of the patients enrolled in the study had a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) versus the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data , the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ oo@@ ster@@ tem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ast@@ rec@@ ase should be considered in the therapy optimisation with PI treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50@@ 8 % increased , by contrast , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x when rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dose ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore the minimum concentration in the steady state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resor@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ common am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component varies depending on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given with caution when given at the same time ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
as a solution , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bio@@ available than the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of a kidney function disorder should be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schemes lead to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those obtained from healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without the simultaneous administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies for can@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas oc@@ ated in do@@ si@@ z@@ ations that correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ x ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the development of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas was not yet enlightened and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and the therapeutic use , showed little evidence of the acceptance of clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes included , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical practice by measuring AST , AL@@ T and alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase activity .
until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has been observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of A@@ gen@@ ase after the end of the treatment .
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals that were treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality both in the control animals and in the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
in systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to humans , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus @-@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed that indicate delayed development .
24 If A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are applied without the addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses must be applied to as@@ generic ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the concur@@ rent application should be treated with care in patients with low or moderate liver function disorder . in patients with severe liver function disorder , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines which may cause serious or life threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International standard ised ratio ) , methods for determining drug concentration are available .
A@@ regeneration should be reduced to 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ rophi@@ es was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and drug @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r leading to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance to resistance .
50@@ 8 % increased , by contrast , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x when rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were obtained twice daily in the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered twice daily .
dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but a close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed surveillance is recommended , as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
careful clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be performed , as an exact pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ gener@@ ase , at least half of the recommended dose is advised to reduce the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin , although no clinical data is available for this purpose .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ p@@ am@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ p@@ am@@ pin and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times per day ) more than 7 days on subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with simultaneous dispens@@ ing of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with ather@@ os@@ clerosis , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended due to the possibility of weak@@ ening or ampli@@ fication of the anti @-@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of or@@ tho @-@ nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0,@@ 0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1,0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a 10 % decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
during pregnancy , this drug may be used only after careful weighing of the possible benefit for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fo@@ etus .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the implant@@ ation in the uter@@ us up to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during the lac@@ tation period .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gen@@ ase was investigated in adults and in children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in case of an over@@ dose , the patient must observe signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary support measures .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro to HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was investigated in both acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on this data , the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ oo@@ ster@@ tem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ast@@ rec@@ ase should be considered in the case of therapy optimisation with PI treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component varies depending on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given with caution when given at the same time ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
also , the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of a kidney function disorder should be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies for can@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas were observed in case of dos@@ ages which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ x ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the development of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas was not yet enlightened and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and the therapeutic use , showed little evidence for the acceptance of clinical relevance of these findings .

studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals that were treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality both in the control animals and in the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that in Jung@@ le the metabolism routes are not fully mature , so that Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .
generic A@@ gen@@ ase is used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the use of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inclusion has not been proven either in patients treated with PI , nor with PI treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for taking up is 14 % less than am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; hence , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should , once they are able to swallow the capsules , stop taking the solution to take in ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for am@@ pren@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 m@@ l. ) am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily maximum dose of 28@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , as no dose recommendation for the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake and low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be given , this combination with these patient groups can be avoided .
although a dose adaptation for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of high propylene gly@@ col@@ ide , A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in infants and children under 4 years of age , in pregnant women , with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z .
patients should be advised that ast@@ ral or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with A@@ gen@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of 47 of HIV transmission to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines which may cause serious or life threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International standard ised ratio ) , methods for determining drug concentration are available .
a rash should be set in duration if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ rophi@@ es was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in h@@ ein@@ ophil@@ ous patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneously cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis occur .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r leading to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance to resistance .
50@@ 8 % increased , by contrast , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x when rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
simultaneous intake of A@@ gener@@ ase can greatly increase their plasma concentrations and lead to related side effects with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
based on data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , a significant higher plasma concentration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is expected after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for the human being is not known . due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the prop@@ yl@@ gly@@ co@@ l it may not be used during pregnancy ( see section 4.3 ) .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven in the milk of lac@@ tation rats , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the implant@@ ation in the uter@@ us up to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a decreased increase in 55 body weight during the lac@@ tation period .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gen@@ ase was investigated in adults and in children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are in connection with the intake of A@@ gen@@ ase or another at the same time as HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dosage , as in other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
early abor@@ tion of a sa@@ wing 60 treatment is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits , which can affect the subsequent treatment adver@@ sely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on this data , the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ oo@@ ster@@ tem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ast@@ rec@@ ase should be considered in the therapy optimisation with PI treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be attached to a large ve@@ to volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
the underlying mechanism for the development of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas was not yet enlightened and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .

your doctor will usually instruc@@ t you to apply A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to enhance the effect of A@@ gener@@ ase .
the use of as@@ generic is based on the individual viral resistance test carried out by your doctor for you and your treatment history .
tell your doctor if you are suffering from one of the above mentioned diseases or take any of the drugs mentioned above .
if your doctor has recommended that you take A@@ gr@@ ase capsules together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to strengthen the effect ( boo@@ ster ) , make sure you have carefully read the use information about Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r before starting the treatment .
there are also no sufficient information to recommend the application of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to increase the efficiency of children aged 4 to 12 years or generally in patients under 50 kg body weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore it is important that you read the section &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Take A@@ round with other medicines &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you start taking A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the application frequency and the duration of the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated . • For infants in the genital area , the cream is to be carried out three times a week for up to 16 weeks . • In case of acute ker@@ at@@ oses , it is performed three times a week during one or two weeks of treatment , with four weeks of pause between treatment cycles .
the cream is thin @-@ lay@@ ered to the affected areas of the skin before bed@@ time so that they remain on the skin for a long time ( about eight hours ) before they are washed off .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the drug ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area each 16 weeks .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two trials , in which patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or the placebo treated either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tumours after 12 weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies of a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses .
in all trials , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the placebo . • In the treatment of patients in the genital area , the total healing rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in the patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a , but only 3 % to 80 % of the patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a showed a full healing rate of up to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application point of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic or hyper@@ trop@@ hic ker@@ at@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or scal@@ p in immun@@ ological adults , if the size or number of les@@ ions limit efficacy and / or the acceptance of cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .
Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is to continue until all visible asc@@ ents have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ anal area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment course described above should be considered if intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if after the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated les@@ ions were only cured in@@ completely , another therapy should start ( see Section 4.4 ) .
when a dose is om@@ itted , the patient sol@@ ves the cream as soon as he / she notices it and then proceed with the usual therapy plan .
i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream can be applied in a thin layer and rub@@ bed into the puri@@ fied skin area infected with cow@@ war@@ ts until the cream is fully dra@@ ined .
it should take place in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
it should take place in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction .
in other studies where no daily pre @-@ hom@@ olog@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and one case were observed with a frac@@ ture leading to the circumc@@ ision .
in an application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses an increased risk of severe local skin irritation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases severe local skin irritation was observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or led to temporary physical impairment .
in cases where such reactions oc@@ cured at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had trouble passing urine which necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
for the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous inj@@ ections for the treatment of external ti@@ lt war@@ ts in the genital and anal@@ ges@@ ic area , no clinical experience has been found so far .
although limited data suggest an increased rate of ti@@ lt reduction in HIV positive patients , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown a lesser effectiveness in this group of patients concerning the removal of the ti@@ lt war@@ ts .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips , or the hair@@ line was not investigated .
local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during therapy or the reactions occur after conclusion of the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s discomfort or due to the severity of the local skin reactions , a treatment break of several days may be made .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after regeneration of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since there are currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable therapies should be considered in the case of super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
no clinical experience is present in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , therefore the use of pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors is not recommended .
data from an open clinical study indicates that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is less chance of response to i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not investigated for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area inside the lip area .
there are only very limited data on the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such application is not recommended .
local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions usually decrease in intensity in the course of therapy or go back after the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if the local skin reactions cause severe discomfort or are very strong to the patient , the treatment may be exposed for a few days .
data from an open clinical study indicates that patients with more than 8 ac@@ - les@@ ions showed a lower overall healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with care in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies show no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / embry@@ onic development , ob@@ struction or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although the serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) can be achieved neither after a one @-@ time nor after several topical application , no recommendation can be given during the lac@@ tation period .
the most common adverse events related to the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects in the studies with three weeks of treatment were local reactions in the place of treating the ti@@ lt war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
among the most commonly reported and likely or possibly with the application of the i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects include discomfort in the application location with an incidence of 28.@@ 1 % .
the reported adverse events reported by 185 with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical trial of Phase III clinical trials are shown below .
the most common , most likely or possibly with the application of the i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in the related side effect were a reaction to the application location in these studies ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the side effects specified by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of phase III with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
the evaluation of clinical signs planned according to the test plan shows that placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream are often associated with local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ec@@ c@@ itation / abor@@ ting ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the evaluation of clinical signs planned according to the test plan shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream , severe ery@@ thro@@ cytes ( 31 % ) , severe erosion ( 13 % ) , and severe de@@ formation and cal@@ ming ( 19 % ) occurred .
in clinical trials evaluating the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ ato@@ sis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was observed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the inad@@ vert@@ ent or@@ ale intake of 200 mg of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , equivalent to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ onia , which norm@@ alized after or@@ ally or intraven@@ ous fluids .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation , systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the topical application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies it was possible to show that the efficacy in relation to a complete healing of the ti@@ lt war@@ ts in an i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine treatment over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment was clearly superior .
at 60 % of patients who had exhausted all of the 119 patients who had exhausted all other forms of therapy , this was the case with 20 % of the 105 patients who had exhausted all other forms of therapy ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 15@@ 7 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared to 5 % of 161 @-@ treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in five times a week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fici@@ elle bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all patients treated clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od during three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non@@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic les@@ ions within a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the un@@ ha@@ iry scal@@ p or face .
the two @-@ year data from two combined observ@@ ational studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) after one or two treatment periods .
in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients , pa@@ edi@@ atric patients usually do not appear in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and are therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a Cream has been studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials of children between 2 and 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the doses investigated there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks / week ) .
minimal systemic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed during the three @-@ week application during 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentrations in the serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and were 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 mg / ml in the application in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 single bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated obvious half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; this indicates prolonged retention of the medicine in the skin .
the data for systemic exposure showed that the resor@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od after topical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years was low and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on the der@@ mal toxic@@ ity of the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of CG led to significantly lowered body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study carried out for four months for the der@@ mal application showed no similar effects for the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice at the mal@@ er administration on three days a week did not indu@@ ce tumours in the application .
the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od is only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , there is a risk to humans due to systemic exposure to be very low .
tum@@ ors entered the group of mice treated with the substance @-@ free cream earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

in the study mainly the safety of the drug was examined , but its effectiveness was also measured ( by examining its effect in terms of reducing G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ azi@@ y@@ me in patients at the age of over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headaches , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion site .
very common side effects in patients less than five years are elevated blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of lung function ) , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be disclosed each year and , where necessary , update this summary .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is known to be patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in response to the reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. permission for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me across the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mamm@@ ali@@ an cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ arian of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient toler@@ ates this , every 15 minutes in single steps can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with ren@@ al or liver failure was not determined and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ azi@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an adequate clinical setting where recovery facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the clinical Phase 3 study , it is expected that nearly all Ig@@ G antibodies are immune to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the start of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since there is little experience concerning the resum@@ ption of the treatment after a longer break , due to the theoretically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions following an inter@@ ruption of the treatment must be treated cau@@ ti@@ ously .
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ reti@@ ants ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in the case of a mild or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weighed and / or a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in the case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 are ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the preceding reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used at the same time with Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ aine , because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal studies do not cause direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
as there is no data for new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to breast milk compared to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , it is recommended to do not breast @-@ feed during treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
adverse events in clinical trials were primarily treated as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( duration of treatment up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants less than 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the phase III study and their pro@@ long@@ ation in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older during a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are listed in the following table according to the following Frequ@@ encies : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ associated involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions also occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respir@@ ation and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported in a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 years , with predominantly severe follow @-@ up and a treatment duration up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients were treated with a serum version within 3 months of the treatment , with a severe follow @-@ up usually within one month at the age of 5 ( average after 26 days versus 45 days for patients at the age of 5 and older ) .
until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or until premature ej@@ ection from the study ) , no antibodies were present in 13 / 45 patients ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , including 3 patients with whom there was never a serum version .
patients with a lack of low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG level in the urine , while a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the urine was found in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters .
four patients ( three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study ) showed a marginal or low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro , which seemed to imp@@ air clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the urine .
the presence of antibodies did not seem to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the ration@@ ale for the enzyme therapy is based in one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ str@@ ats and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and is absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via man@@ ose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire spectrum of the disease , the majority of patients from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute audi@@ tor .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received a further 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and hearing , which is presented in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as mentioned in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is not clin@@ ically significant over this period and the total lung volume increases in proportion to the size of the children .
of the 26 patients with H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease in the G@@ AG mirror was found in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) , which remained constant until the end of the study .
in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between patients taking into account clin@@ ically significant changes across five active efficacy variables ( expected percentage of normal FE@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute audi@@ tory , range of movement of shoulder joint A@@ HI ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a worsen@@ ing of 9 patients ( 20 % ) were observed .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted , in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion ( 16 patients with severe tra@@ verse shape and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased G@@ ag@@ - levels in the urine in week 22 .
in several patients a size increase ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) found a normal mental development speed for this age group The younger patients with the severe follow @-@ up form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental development speed , whereas in the older patients with severe follow @-@ up only limited or no progress was observed in cognitive development .
in a phase 4 study , tests on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosage schemes were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute audi@@ ting test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks may represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulty with weekly inj@@ ections ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to those in older and less severely affected patients .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with unique gift , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
since no compatibility studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines except with the ones listed under 6.@@ 6 .

within the given time , the holder of the authorisation for placing on the market has completed the following program of study , the results of which are the basis for the annual evaluation report on the benefit @-@ risk ratio .
this register will provide long @-@ term safety and efficacy information for patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans ) , is either in a small amount , or this enzyme is completely absent .
if you are allergic to one of the ingredients of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have an allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
if you use al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you use medicines that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ aine , because there is a potential risk of a dimin@@ ished effect of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medications or have recently taken medicine , including non @-@ prescription drugs .
indications for handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to application and is intended for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors and medical staff ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient endure this , gradually increase to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes .

the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information available annually , and if necessary , the package will be updated .
if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it will not be stored for more than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C if the di@@ lution is under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions .
preparation of the al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • Dep@@ ending on the body weight of the individual patient , first determine the number of th@@ inners to di@@ lu@@ ent .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another anti @-@ cancer drug ) and &quot; malign@@ ant &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer that does not attack the epitheli@@ al cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole therapy in patients who have not previously received chemotherapy , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy regi@@ mens .
to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the gift of C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ em@@ etic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( medicine for vom@@ iting ) and fluids ( to prevent de@@ hydr@@ ation ) should be given . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in patients whose blood @-@ image changes or in which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , stopped or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed thus s@@ lows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
the conversion of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed to its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer life time in cancer cells .
for the treatment of malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another medicine against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months at the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the mean survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.@@ 3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months for doc@@ et@@ axel .
in both studies , however , patients with cancer did not attack the epitheli@@ al cells during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta for longer survival compared to the comparative medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. a permit for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each pass @-@ through bottle must be dissolved with a 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dose is taken from the water bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small @-@ cell lung cancer except for overwhel@@ m@@ ingly plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with loc@@ alized or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer except for overwhel@@ m@@ ingly plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - In@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment course .
in order to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid should be given the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed Gift and on the day after the treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose as well as after each third treatment course .
in patients receiving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , a complete blood picture should be created before each application , including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place taking into account the Na@@ di@@ rs of the blood picture or the maximal non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the predic@@ tive treatment cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are suitable for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
should patients develop non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient has the value before treatment
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 dose @-@ reduc@@ tis or as a result of the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that there is an increased risk of side effects in patients at the age of 65 or above , compared to patients at the age of 65 .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials , no dose adap@@ tations were necessary in patients with a Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 45 ml / min which go beyond the recommended dose adap@@ tations for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - B@@ order and / or Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase values of &gt; the 3,@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ times the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies .
patients must be monitored with respect to bone mar@@ in@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be administered to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ al count returns a value ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ and the plat@@ el@@ et cy@@ te number once more a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity observed in the preceding treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and non@@ corro@@ sive toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was observed when a pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be instructed to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous intake of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre@@ existing hypertension or diabetes .
for this reason , clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space should be considered to be drainage of the eff@@ usion prior to P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment .
5 Cardi@@ ovascular events including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed if this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic compound .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated life vacc@@ ines ( excluding yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible gra@@ ding of the reproductive capacity is due to P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised in front of the treatment chin to obtain advice regarding the sperm conservation .
high doses of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ an ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 3 g daily ) can result in reduced p@@ em@@ eal de@@ position in patients with normal kidney function ( ≥ 3 g daily ) .
therefore , caution is required if high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be applied in high doses for patients with normal kidney function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed are avoided ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since there is no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ life time such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , simultaneous use with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - mixed .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat patients with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there is no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be used during pregnancy unless absolutely challenging , and after careful weighing of the benefits for the mother and the risk of fo@@ etus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage of reproductive capacity is due to P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the start of treatment to obtain advice regarding the blocking of the sperm .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed exceeds mother &apos;s milk and unwanted effects on breast @-@ fed infants cannot be excluded .
the following table shows the incidence and severity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma , random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed and 16@@ 3 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma who were random@@ ised to receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .
side effects Frequ@@ ency information : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 and &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 and &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) and not known ( not estimated on the basis of the available data of spontan@@ eity ) .

for this table a threshold of 5 % was set for the recording of all events in which the reporting doctor held a connection with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed for possible .
clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity , which were reported in &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who were random@@ ised to P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , included su@@ pra@@ v@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mia .
clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity grade 3 and 4 was similar to the consolidated results of three single P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed mono@@ therapies ( n = 16@@ 4 ) of phase 2 , except neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to be traced back to differences in patient population as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies include chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and significantly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal liver function tests .
the following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse events that could be possible in connection with study medication ; they were reported to &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 Pati@@ ents with NSC@@ LC who were random@@ ised to receive C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed and 8@@ 30 patients with NSC@@ LC who were random@@ ised to receive C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ abine .

clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity reported in &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who received ran@@ - dom@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed :
severe cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular insulin and tran@@ sit@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks were occasionally reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , which is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .
in patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment occasionally cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal perfor@@ ation , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ litis ) were reported in patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment .
patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment occasionally reported cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory failure .
there have been reported cases of acute ren@@ al failure in P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy drugs ( see Section 4.4 ) .
cases of radi@@ otherapy were reported in patients treated before , during or after their P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate , which exercises its effect by interrup@@ ting important fol@@ lic acid @-@ dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed acts as an anti @-@ fol@@ ate with several points of attack by blocking the thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ l@@ yn@@ th@@ ase ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ logical @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and gly@@ cin@@ am@@ i@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ d@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , the key @-@ dependent key enzymes of the de nov@@ o bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ - and Pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multic@@ entre , random@@ ised , single @-@ blind phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ ically treated patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ural am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma showed that patients with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically meaningful benefit to those patients who were only treated with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the investig@@ ational medication ( random@@ ized and treated ) in the treatment arm .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) in comparison with the only C@@ is@@ pla@@ - tin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms were improved by improving lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and worsen@@ ing lung function over time in the control arm .
a multi @-@ center , random@@ ised , open phase III trial with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC showed a medi@@ an survival time of 8.@@ 3 months in patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on overall survival was in favor of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ re@@ epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 3@@ 99 , 9,@@ 3 versus 7.@@ 4 months , adjusted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data from a random@@ ized , controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre@@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ axel are similar .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in combination with gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
mean PFS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.@@ 1 months for the combination Gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 31.@@ 3 ) , the overall response rate was 28.@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 31.@@ 4 ) for the combination Gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .

dissolve the contents of the 100 mg / ml cup bottles with a 0.@@ 9 % sodium @-@ chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) without preserv@@ atives , which results in a solution with a concentration of about 25 mg / ml of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed .
dissolve the contents of the 500 mg / ml cup bottles containing 20 ml of 0.@@ 9 % sodium @-@ chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) without preserv@@ atives , which results in a solution with a concentration of about 25 mg / ml of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed .
the resulting solution is clear and the colour range extends from color@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish without compromising the quality of the product .
it is used for overweight adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BM@@ I ) ≥ 28 kg per square metre in conjunction with a low @-@ cal@@ orie , low @-@ fat diet .
patients who take All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot break down some fats in the food , thereby causing a quarter of the fats to be covered with the food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ine .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared with 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 compared to placebo .
in both studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who received All@@ i 60 mg received an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after one year , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss could be observed for patients .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily patches on after , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stu@@ cco , stu@@ n rope , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( f@@ eces ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it should not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in gra@@ ft patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it must also not be applied to patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which not enough nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or in ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant women or breast@@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted the Gla@@ xo Group Limited authorisation for placing Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body Mass Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in combination with a slightly hypo@@ cal@@ oric , low @-@ fat diet .
all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , since there is not enough data on efficacy and safety .
however , since or@@ list@@ at is only temporarily resor@@ bed , no adjustment of dosage is necessary in older and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or any of the other components • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.6 ) • Chr@@ onic mal@@ absorption syndrome • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
since weight reduction in diabetes can go hand in hand with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult with all@@ i a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic must be adapted if necessary .
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these drugs needs to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnancy @-@ related measures in order to prevent possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed .
when applying War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( internationally regular @-@ ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta carot@@ ene remained in the normal range .
however , patients should be advised to take a complementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see Section 4.4 ) .
after the application of a one @-@ time dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a marginal decrease in the am@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time .
animal studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are associated with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of recorded fat is prevented .
gastro@@ intestinal adverse events were obtained from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg for a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not predictable ) .
the incidence of known adverse events reported after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is not known , as these events have been reported voluntarily by a population of unknown magnitude .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and obes@@ e patients over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosing either side effects or similar side effects as reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at were reported .
based on investigations on humans and animals , a rapid recovery of any systemic effects caused by the lip@@ id @-@ inhibit@@ ing properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect is achieved in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ines by co@@ valent bonding to the active ser@@ in @-@ remainder of the ga@@ stri@@ c and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic le@@ ases .
clinical trials have been derived that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocks the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo controlled trials in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 determine the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ cal@@ oric , low @-@ fat diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight versus the initial value ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as part of those study participants who lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although weight reduction was observed for more than 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the mean change in the Gesamt@@ ch@@ ol@@ esterin was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % with or@@ list@@ at -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the mean change in L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % with or@@ list@@ at ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( bas@@ eline value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at waist circum@@ ference , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( initial value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( bas@@ eline value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg of or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 in general , in therapeutic doses , not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in the plasma could only be demonstrated spor@@ adi@@ cally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of accumulation .
two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ s@@ ated Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after spl@@ itting the N @-@ form yl leu@@ cine group ) , were identified , representing approximately 42 % of total plasma concentration .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not show any particular danger to humans .

the most common side effects are related to the effects of the capsules , resulting in increased fat from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks of the treatment , as you may not have consistently reduced the fat content in your diet .
with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize the diet @-@ related side effects : • Begin for a few days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a low @-@ fat diet .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit will decrease .
save the amount of calories and fat you are allowed to take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main court or a substantial bed@@ side table , as you might have done with other programs for weight reduction . • Most people with those accompanying symptoms learn to control these with time by adjusting their diet .
• Do not store medicines for children . • Do not store in excess of 25 ° C after the exp@@ iry date specified on the container . • Ke@@ ep the container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lica gel , which serve to keep the capsules dry .
do not swallow this . • You can carry your daily dose all@@ i in the blue transport box ( shuttle ) that is included in this package .

permanent weight loss , such as improving nutrition and exercise , can prevent serious diseases and have a positive impact on your health .
select meals containing a wide range of nutrients and gradually learn to nour@@ ish yourself permanently .
energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find as indication of food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should consume a maximum per day .
note the tables below in this section . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal .
the amount of calories provided for you can be found in the information below , which indicates the number of calories that is appropriate for you . • D@@ ue to the capsule &apos;s mode of action , adher@@ ence to the recommended fat intake is decisive .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat .
by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maximize weight loss and at the same time reduce the likel@@ ihood of diet @-@ related side effects . • You should try to decrease progres@@ sively and steadily .

alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies which are strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the efficacy of alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic drug ) .
the use of patients under the age of 18 is not recommended since there is not enough information on the effects in this age group .
this means that the active ingredient inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ine .
in three main studies Alo@@ xi was studied in 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong and moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with alo@@ gues showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours of chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with alo@@ gues showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours of chemotherapy ( 153 from 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted Den@@ n Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . , a licence for the marketing of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
alo@@ xi is indicated : to prevent acute nausea and vom@@ iting in highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy as a result of cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in exc@@ essively em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy as a result of cancer .
the efficacy of al@@ op@@ xi for prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting induced by a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy may be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given before chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on massage , patients with am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ struction or signs of a sub@@ acute ion should be closely monitored after injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is required with simultaneous dispens@@ ing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines which extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ t interval is extended or which tend to such an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ is is not to be used either for prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days after chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five examined chem@@ o@@ therapeutic agents ( C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ in , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a steady St@@ ate@@ - concentration of oral met@@ o@@ clo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , it was shown that the simultaneous application of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( am@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ ine , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ran@@ iti@@ dine , k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience for the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies is not present , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used for pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the treating physician .
in clinical trials , the most common adverse events were observed at a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which could at least be related to alo@@ gues , headaches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the date of performance ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post marketing reports .
there were similar frequencies of adverse events in the group with the highest dosage as in other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effect relationships .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been performed . however , due to the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy for al@@ chem@@ y over@@ dosing .
in two random@@ ised double blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a exc@@ essively em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 micro@@ grams or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients who received 32 mg On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( half @-@ life of 7.@@ 3 hours ) that was given intraven@@ ously on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients receiving a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ine as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 .
results of the study with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
in clinical trials on the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the Q@@ t@@ c interval , were comparable to the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular failure and rep@@ ol@@ arization and to extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was to evaluate the EC@@ G @-@ effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
following IV administration , initial acceptance of plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination from the body with an average termin@@ ale half @-@ life of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area below the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are usually dose @-@ proportional in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3@@ 90 μ and / kg for healthy and cancer patients .
after intraven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase in the plasma concentration of 11 tes@@ tic@@ ular cancer patients was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations show that at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with the value measured after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the single @-@ recur@@ rence of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and about another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites which , compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies of metabol@@ isation have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , the I@@ so@@ enzyme C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After having an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ altered agent made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous bol@@ us injection , total body exposure was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the termin@@ ale elimin@@ atory cure time and the average systemic exposure with pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , however , a reduction in the dose is not justified .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were observed only after expos@@ ures that are considered adequate for the maximum human@@ istic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use .
10 out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies evidence indicates that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and can extend the length of action .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded roughly the 30@@ x of the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily for two years , resulted in an increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al mar@@ row ) and skin tumours in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ is is determined in humans for one @-@ time application , the relevance of these results is regarded as low for humans .
the holder of this authorisation for the placing on the market must inform the European Commission about the plans for placing the drug approved within the framework of this decision .

June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report , in which the rejection of approval for the placing of the medicines intended for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that Al@@ ph@@ e@@ um should resemble a bi@@ ologic drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicinal product that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference medic@@ aments &quot; ) .
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease called by a viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scopic investigation , the liver tissue damages the liver tissue , and the values of the liver enzyme al@@ anine amino @-@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are abnormal in the blood abnormal .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was brought in to stimulate the formation of the active substance .
Al@@ ph@@ e@@ eon manufactures data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ e@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( agent structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C patients the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ e@@ um was compared with the efficacy of the reference serum to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was stopped ( i.e. no indication of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non commercial purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged
concerns have also been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed is not sufficient .
the number of hepatitis C patients responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical study .
after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease cleared again in more patients than with the reference medic@@ ament ; in addition , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from that , the test used in the study was not sufficiently vali@@ dated to determine the extent to which the medicine triggers an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) .
it can be used for the treatment of im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with crust formation ) and small infected la@@ ins ( cra@@ cking or cutting wounds ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used for the treatment of infections which have been proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ eal Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , because al@@ arms may not work against this type of infection .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients less than 18 years , the area to be treated must not exceed 2 % of the body &apos;s surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection had been cleared after the treatment ended .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients treated with placebo responded to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin patients , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together on skin wound , about 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ei@@ ter@@ med cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or infections which were demon@@ stra@@ bly or probably caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is a irritation at the site .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go were out@@ weighed in short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected minor in@@ fir@@ ings , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted the Gla@@ xo Group Ltd. a licence for placing Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined and an alternative therapy should be taken into consideration ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the event of sensi@@ tization or severe local irritation by applying ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment , the treatment should be abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully wi@@ ped out and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection will begin .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not intended to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials of secondary infections , the efficacy of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
an alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or worsen@@ ing of the infected position occurs after a 2 @-@ 3 day treatment .
the effect of the simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been investigated and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended .
a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not to be expected due to the low plasma concentrations , which were achieved in humans after topical application on abra@@ ded skin or infected surface wounds ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 Acc@@ ording to the simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the mean ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x according to topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ in- Sal@@ be increased by 81 % in healthy adult men .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dos@@ h adap@@ tations are not required if topical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during a systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement on effects on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ino@@ ine o@@ int@@ ment should only be applied during pregnancy , when a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ino@@ a is prefer@@ able to the application of a systemic antibiotic .
when deciding whether to continue / stop breast@@ feeding or continue the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go , it is necessary to weigh between the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the baby and the benefit of Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , which have applied to Al@@ tar@@ go , the most common adverse event was Ir@@ rit@@ ation at the date of performance that concerned about 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of p@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mechanism of action of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction with a specific binding site of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data suggest that the binding site of ri@@ bos@@ ome protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P binding site and the pe@@ p@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase center .
through binding to this binding site , p@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line blocks the pe@@ p@@ tide transfer , partially block P @-@ binding sites interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if , due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance , the application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some forms of infection appears to be question@@ able , advice should be sought by experts .
no differences were observed in the in @-@ vitro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of non @-@ response to treatment with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of strains with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
resor@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ino@@ cul@@ ine o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under occ@@ lu@@ sion and applied to sc@@ ented skin for up to 7 days .
from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
samples were taken on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and with the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic inclusion in humans after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 of sc@@ anned skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) was 6@@ 60 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ino@@ id IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
Met@@ abol@@ ism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ scopy was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) performed over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes .

there were no signs of restricted fertility in male nor female rats at oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which resulted in an up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ id skin ) :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study of rats , ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( ≥ 3 @-@ fold of estimated human exposure ) , development sto@@ x@@ iz@@ ity ( reduced body weight of fo@@ etus and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity were observed .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children between 1 and 15 years of age , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ination program consisting of two doses , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is taken .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection while imm@@ uni@@ zation , and ensures that the vacc@@ ination already exists from two doses can be brought to an end .
if a re@@ fres@@ her dose is desired against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; vacc@@ ines work by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teaching &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) as it can defend itself against a disease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after receiving the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the vaccine approved since 1996 and the vacc@@ ination of the Twin@@ rix children registered in 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , however , tw@@ o@@ fold adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a vaccine existing in three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults have also been used as evidence of the use of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children , who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection .
in an additional study involving 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix initiated a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B , between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar to a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain in the injection point , redness , fatigue ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other constitu@@ ents or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
August 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals s.@@ a. a permit for the placing of Ambi@@ rix on the whole
the standard vaccine for pri@@ mers with Ambi@@ rix is made up of two vacc@@ ines , with the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a re@@ fres@@ her vacc@@ ination is desired both for hepatitis A and for hepatitis B , the appropriate vacc@@ ines or combination vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibody levels are the same as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured whether immuno@@ competent persons , who have addressed a hepatitis C vacc@@ ination , need a re@@ fres@@ her vacc@@ ination as protection , as they may be protected even in non @-@ det@@ ectable antibodies by the immun@@ ological memory .
3 As with all injection @-@ vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available for the rare case of an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the gift of the vaccine .
if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standard vaccine is recommended with the combination vaccine , which contains 360 ELISA units of form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , there may be no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s @-@ antibody @-@ value after the basic imm@@ uni@@ zation , so that additional doses of doses may be necessary in these cases .
since intra@@ ocular injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could lead to a sub@@ optimal ino@@ cul@@ ation , these injection methods should be avoided .
however , in case of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ ously as an exception , as it can occur in these cases after intra@@ muscular administration of bleeding .
if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it must be assumed that an adequate immune response may not be achieved .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ ation , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headaches and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thi@@ omer@@ isation and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and wear@@ iness on a basis of calculation per vaccine , but not based on a calculation basis for each person .
pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix in 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the subjects after the dose of the 3 @-@ doses @-@ combination vaccine .
after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of patients who received Ambi@@ rix reported pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in the subjects vacc@@ inated with the 3 dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ern@@ ation was comparable per pro@@ band ( i.e. over the entire vaccine rate at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix ) compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ doses @-@ combination vaccine .
the frequency of severe pain and mat@@ ur@@ ation was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 doses vaccine .
in a comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the ambient group was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3 doses combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the proportion of vaccine candidates who reported serious side effects during the 2 @-@ doses @-@ vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 doses vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis B and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to 15 years , the rate conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9,@@ 1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
ser@@ o conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted at 12 @-@ including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses received Ambi@@ rix and 147 the standard combination vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was evalu@@ able , the dis@@ infection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against Hepatitis B in month 2 and 6 following the administration of the 3 dose im@@ p vaccine than with Ambi@@ rix .
the responses received in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after the full vaccine series ( i.e. in month 7 ) are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ doses @-@ vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 doses vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ s and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immun@@ reaction observed in this trial against both anti@@ gens was comparable to that detected after vacc@@ ination of 3 cans with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical trial at 12 - including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ s and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies can be compared 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination scheme to that in the 0 @-@ 12 month vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose Ambi@@ rix was administered at the same time with the re@@ fres@@ her of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les @-@ m@@ umps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ective and ser@@ o conversion rates for the present formulation as for the previous formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing of any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .
in accordance with Article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state batch release is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorised for this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other means , such as swimming in waters contaminated by water .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not fully protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the full vaccine is completed with 2 cans .
if you / your child is infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vaccine doses ( although you / your child may not feel uncomfortable or ill / feel ill ) a vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
a protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those after hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any ingredient of this vaccine , including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can manifest itself through it@@ chy skin r@@ ashes , short@@ ness of breath , or swelling of the face or tongue . • if you have an allergic reaction to an earlier ino@@ cul@@ ation against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B if you / your child have a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the second dose of vacc@@ ination is usually scheduled ) .
at a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second ino@@ cul@@ ation , the physician will advise you / your child of vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , it will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced amount of effective ingredients per vaccine ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface treatment ) .
the second dose of this vaccine with reduced levels of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vacc@@ ination protection before the end of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected among people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , under the skin and not into the muscle . • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your / his body &apos;s defense / or if you / your child under@@ goes / under@@ goes a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient , so that a blood test may be required to see how strong the reaction to the vacc@@ ination is .
21 . tell your doctor if you / your child may take another medicine ( including those that you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated recently / has been given or has received immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) / has or has planned this in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different extre@@ mi@@ ties as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be given at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ines , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nonetheless be sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , Ambi@@ rix will not be given pregnant or lac@@ t@@ ating women unless it is urgently needed that they can be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B . &quot; &quot; &quot;
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please tell your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) for you / your child .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 t@@ apped cans ) : • pain or discomfort in the pun@@ cture or redness • Mat@@ ty • irrit@@ ability • headache • loss of appetite
♦ often ( up to 1 case per 10 t@@ apped cans ) : • swelling at the injection point • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness • gastro@@ intestinal ail@@ ments
further side effects that have been reported very rarely in days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 re@@ aped doses ) are :
these include locally limited or extensive r@@ ashes that can be it@@ ching or b@@ low@@ ish , swelling of the eye area and face , difficult breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden drop of blood pressure and loss of consciousness .

23 Do you know your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed adverse reactions you / your child significantly affects or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this package .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data that has been known since the initial approval for the placing of the market , the CH@@ MP believes that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix was placed in traffic only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposure .
am@@ moun@@ t@@ aps can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ complete enzyme defect or hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
am@@ moun@@ t@@ aps - split by several single doses to meals - are swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or administered via a gastro@@ intestinal barrier ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of the leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach leading hose ) .
it was not a comparative study because am@@ mon@@ aps could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a placebo @-@ based drug , that is , without drug ) .
am@@ mount can also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste mal@@ aise , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ites in patients with disturbances of the ure@@ a cycle were effectively prevented from high ammon@@ ia levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ aut was approved in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information on this drug was presented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete enzyme shortage has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late mani@@ feste form ( incomplete enzyme defect that mani@@ f@@ ests after the first month of life ) there is an indication of the use if hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cephal@@ opathy is present in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with hi@@ cc@@ ups , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually considering the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for growth and development .
according to the previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium yl@@ but@@ y@@ concentrate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg , as well as adolescents and adults .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin bam@@ y@@ las@@ e .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders as there is a risk of the formation of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
for this reason , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma .
because met@@ abo@@ li@@ zation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate takes place via the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
the significance of these results in pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats at high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it was a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal propag@@ ation and increased neur@@ on loss .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functional nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be established whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in humans into breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at least one adverse event ( AE ) occurred in 56 % of patients and 78 % of these adverse events were considered not to be associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tate , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dosing occurred in a 5 month old inf@@ ant with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity during an intraven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abo@@ lically active compound that is acet@@ yl@@ ated with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is similar to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disturbances of the ure@@ a cycle can be thought to be produced for each gram containing sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is started immediately in order to improve the chances of survival and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ ant , and the disease itself led to death even in the treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with its nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues .
through hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate new@@ born at post@@ part@@ um ( however within the first month of life ) to 80 % .
patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of the pregnancy and which had already been treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cephal@@ opathy was the survival rate of 100 % , but even in these patients it occurred with many to mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ ic form of the Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ker bam@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which were recovered by a hyper@@ ammon@@ ium cephal@@ opathy and then permanently treated with sodium yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a protein @-@ reduced diet , survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl acet@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated with glut@@ amine in the liver and kidneys with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were measured after a single dose of 5 g sodium yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate on so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disturbances of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in exchange and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , as well as repeated donations of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after IV administration of sodium yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium meth@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form , 15 minutes after taking measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected .
in the majority of patients with ure@@ a cycle disturbances or hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was not det@@ ectable next morning after night fasting .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the average phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kidneys .
after the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate did not have any adverse effects in rats treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic cans ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ules are either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who can not swallow tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a gastro@@ stom@@ y or a nas@@ al probe .
according to the previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium yl@@ but@@ y@@ concentrate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg , as well as adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin bam@@ y@@ las@@ e .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gar@@ net contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat @-@ fl@@ utes were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , les@@ ions were found in the pyramid @-@ cells of the brain @-@ bark .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tate , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
sto@@ ich@@ omet@@ rically seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disturbances of the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that for each gram sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate is produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in treatment , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium meth@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ulate form , 15 minutes after taking measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected .
during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
this procedure contains the small measuring spoon 0,@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.@@ 6 g sodium yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient has to receive the medicine by a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accumulate in the body after consuming proteins in the body .
you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can influence the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
during the lac@@ tation period , you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as the medicine may pass into breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , headaches , mal@@ function disorders , refra@@ ction of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and worsen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency room of your hospital for initi@@ ation of appropriate treatment .
if you forgot to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

if you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS in the same single doses or via a ga@@ stri@@ c acid ( hose which runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( tube that is led through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Take a he@@ aped measuring spoon of gran@@ ulate from the container . • Cut a straight edge , e.g. a knife back over the top of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ules . • Take the recommended amount of measuring spoon of gran@@ ules from the container .
angi@@ otherapy is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute coron@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( AC@@ S , reduced blood flow to the heart ) , for example in unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stress &quot; ( an abnormal measurement value of the electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ om@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14@@ ,000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S in which the effect of angi@@ om@@ yel@@ ia was compared with a single dose or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another drug aimed at preventing blood cl@@ ots ) compared to conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
during the PCI was used a st@@ ent ( a short tube remaining in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) and they also received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of AC@@ S , Angi@@ ox - with or without a gift of G@@ PI - was as effective in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or one year as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who underwent a PCI , Angi@@ ox was as effective in terms of all indicators as he@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding during which it was much more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ om@@ od@@ ine may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ dop@@ ru@@ dine , other hi@@ ru@@ dine , or any of the other components .
it may not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the treatment of AC@@ S and a PCI is an acceptable substitute for he@@ par@@ in .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to appro@@ ve the transfer of angi@@ om@@ ox across the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST lifting inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or early intervention .
the recommended initi@@ al@@ dose of angi@@ om@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous return of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is used in a further sequence , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the operation is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours after the clinical requirements .
immediately before the procedure , a bol@@ us release should be administered from 0.5 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation .
the recommended dose of angi@@ om@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and one immediately followed intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery .
the safety and efficacy of an all @-@ in @-@ one bol@@ us @-@ offering of angi@@ om@@ ox has not been investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place .
in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before the application and the bol@@ us dose can be administered intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate ren@@ al function restriction ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) .
if the ACT @-@ value is below 225 seconds , it is recommended to admini@@ ster a second Bol@@ t dose of 0.3 mg / kg and re@@ check the ACT 5 minutes after the second dose of the bolt .
in patients with moderate ren@@ al damage , which were included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the application of the Bi@@ vali@@ ant @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients are contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ om@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous administration of frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular lifting .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or other constitu@@ ent or against Hi@@ ru@@ dine • active hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges or increased risk of bleeding due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis system and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ dop@@ ru@@ din is given in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if the majority of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges occur in patients suffering from arter@@ ial coron@@ ary ar@@ tery occ@@ lu@@ sion , patients who undergo a per@@ cut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) may be bleeding during treatment .
in patients who are taking War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ vali@@ ant , a monitoring of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after sett@@ ling treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din is again achieved prior to treatment .
based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ators ) , it can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of bleeding .
in combination with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ators or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters are checked regularly .
animal experimental studies are inadequate in regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , ob@@ struction or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ vali@@ fer@@ ine alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ vali@@ ant group and in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients more than 65 years of age were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding was defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding like in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in groups with He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ arter@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or bleeding in the punc@@ tual area , reducing the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with well @-@ known bleeding point , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
other , less frequently observed hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges that occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; points of the spot , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck .
the following information on side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with Bi@@ vali@@ ant in 6000 patients who underwent a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ vali@@ ant group and in patients treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients more than 65 years of age were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects not listed above have been reported in practice after extensive use and are group@@ ed according to system organ@@ si@@ es in Table 6 .
in case of an over@@ dose , the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ ant is to be stopped immediately and the patient is closely mes@@ h@@ ed with regard to signs of bleeding .
angi@@ om@@ ox contains Bi@@ vali@@ fer@@ ine , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bo@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both the cataly@@ tic centre and the ani@@ onic region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in is present in the liquid phase or in cl@@ ots .
the binding of bic@@ vali@@ fer@@ ine to th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in , and thus its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ine is slowly spl@@ itting up the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ant @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thus re@@ generating the function of the active center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din with serum from patients who had come to he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) did not indu@@ ce a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cytes aggregate reaction .
in healthy subjects and in patients , Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is proved by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was performed with the patient below , an additional bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bic@@ vali@@ ant should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the procedure is increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was given in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ( AC@@ S ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST lifting attacks ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or prior to angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or with the PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were spread evenly across the 3 arms .
about 77 % of patients had a recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EC@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and around 99 % of all patients underwent angi@@ ography within 72 hours .

the 30 @-@ day results , based on quad@@ ru@@ ple and triple end@@ points of a random@@ ized double blind study with more than 6,000 patients who underwent a PCI ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , are presented in table 10 .
clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the use of angi@@ om@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ vali@@ ant were evaluated in patients who underwent a perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with AC@@ S .
it is expected that Bi@@ vali@@ din as a pe@@ p@@ tide carries a cat@@ abol@@ ism into his amino acid constitu@@ ents with subsequent re@@ use of the amino acids in the body pool .
the primary met@@ abo@@ li@@ ary , resulting from the split of the AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence through Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , is not effective due to the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for the treatment of adults , adolescents and children from six years onwards with diabetes that require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ e@@ ously ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the thi@@ ghs or the upper arm or administered as a continuous in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose ( sugar@@ s ) in the blood or cannot effectively process insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has shorter active life than a short acting human@@ insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in the application in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , where insulin cannot be operated effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of efficacy was to change the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with Type 1 diabetes in adults , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed after six months compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin cra@@ per .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other components , or in patients who already suffer from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH a licence for placing A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the abdominal wall , th@@ igh or delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ an@@ e@@ ously by continuous in@@ fusion in the abdominal area .
due to the reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin requirements in patients with a reduction in liver function can be reduced .
any change of the effective strength , the brand ( producer ) , insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ ret@@ arded etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the production method can result in a change in insulin requirements .
3 A inadequate dosage or dis@@ continuation of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis . these conditions are potentially life threatening .
changing a patient to another insulin type or an insulin produced by another manufacturer should be conducted under strict medical supervision and may necess@@ itate a change of dosage .
the time of re@@ occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment plan .
substances that increase blood sugar @-@ lowering activity and increase the prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , hydro@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide .
in addition , symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c regulation can be weakened or missing under the effect of sympath@@ ies such as beta block@@ ers , c@@ lon@@ i@@ din , gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ dine and reser@@ pine .
experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in passes into human breast milk , but in general insulin is not absorbed into the mother &apos;s milk nor is it resor@@ bed to oral use .

severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia with loss of consciousness can be treated by means of intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , given by an appropriately trained person , or by intraven@@ ous injection of glucose by a physician .
after a glu@@ f@@ ag@@ onal injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose consumption ( especially through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) and inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in takes place more quickly in the sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and the active time is shorter than with cou@@ - man@@ e normal insulin .
in a study of 18 male individuals at the age of 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes m@@ oll@@ - tus , insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in showed a glu@@ cos@@ ity @-@ related effect of 0.@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg in the therapeutic @-@ relevant dosage range of 0.@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg , exactly like human insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ al effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
the data showed that an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal results in a similar post @-@ di@@ aly@@ di@@ al gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control as with a human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before meal .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in was purchased 2 minutes before the meal , a better postoperative check was achieved than with the human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
when applied to insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a similar gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with human normal insulin , which is given 2 r@@ ents before meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at a dose of 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal compared to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes before the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1A ) as well as compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at a dose of 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal compared to human nor@@ - mal@@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
