<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Research Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information about your illness or your treatment, please read the package leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>

<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg of melting tablets (tablets which dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. unpolar thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I disorder, a mental condition in which the patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal high-tuning) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes and for the prevention of manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for rapid control of increased unrest or behavioural disorders if the oral intake of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be used to take in or the melting tablets in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are taking other drugs at the same time as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This interferes with the transmission of signals between brain cells by "neurotransmitters," i.e., chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells to one another.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole is believed to be a "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole acts like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in a lesser degree than the neurotransmitter acts to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole contributes to normalising the activity of the brain, reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing it from occurring.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify, preventing the recurrence of symptoms, was examined in three studies over to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar disorders that suffered from increased restlessness, over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared over twelve weeks to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence, in 160 patients where the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from increased unrest, with which of Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, changing the symptoms of patients was investigated using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution for taking off (absorbs).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly greater reduction in symptoms than those receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application to treat bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short-term studies.</seg>
<seg id="22">Moreover, up to 74 weeks Abilify effectively prevented the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses also decreased more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similar effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify for taking (observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled), nausea, vomiting (nausea), hypersecretion (increased saliva production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety states.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar I disorder and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who predominantly had manic episodes and in which the manic episodes were addressing the treatment with Aripiprazole across the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">Furthermore, the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in case of rapid control of increased unrest and behavioural disturbances in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, if oral therapy is not appropriate, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the placing of Abilify across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes were addressing the treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased efficacy in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify amounts to 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">Considering the greater sensitivity of this group of patients, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti-psychotic therapy, even when treating with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that there was no increased suicide risk in patients with bipolar disorder compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be administered cautiously in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, insufficiency), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose of hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering medicines) or hypertension (including celery and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskinesia: in clinical trials which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports about dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If symptoms and symptoms of late dyskinesia are present in a patient treated with Abilify, it should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of a MNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be deposited.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazole should be used with care in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or at states associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">There was, however, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response to undesired cerebrovascular events involving patients treated with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events involving Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents treated patients who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydips, polyurie, polyphagy and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored in terms of deteriorating glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenia and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advisable when Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally-effective medicines with overbearing side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolites, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 Extensive Metabolites.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the common gift of Ketoconazol or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After replacing the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose height before starting the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be administered with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">Doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextrophomorphan / 3-methoxymorphinan-Ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazole) and 3A4 (Dextrometamorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">This drug may not be used during pregnancy, unless the potential benefits are clearly the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant adverse events (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study over 52 weeks, a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including parinsonism, acathisie, dystonia and dyskinesia occurred in patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients with Aripiprazole and 13.1% in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole was 15.1% in patients with Olanzapine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar I disorder - In a controlled study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 23,5% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients with haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">Another study of 12 weeks showed the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients suffering from Aripiprazole and 17.6% for those with lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18,2% was for patients treated with Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">CPK increases (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">The side effects associated with an antipsychotic therapy are the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesired cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintended or intentional acute overdoses were observed with Aripiprazole alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without deaths.</seg>
<seg id="73">There is no information on the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole; however, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of an overdose because Aripiprazole has a high plasma protein binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole is mediated in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder over the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazole showed in vitro a high affinity to the dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and to the serotonin 5HT1 and 5HT2 receptor as well as a moderate affinity to the dopamine D4, to the serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">A dose-dependent reduction of the binding of 11C-racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at Nucleus caudatus and the cyclamen demonstrated a dose dependent dose of Aripiprazole in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In one haloperidol-controlled study, in week 52 the proportion of responder patients who had a response to study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values of measured scales, which were defined as secondary educational goals, including PANSS and the Montgomery depression scale, showed significantly stronger improvement than at haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole showed a significantly higher decline in the rate of return, which was 34% in the Aripiprazole Group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olantap-controlled, multi-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target was' weight gain ', significantly fewer patients achieved a weight gain of at least 7% versus the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg in an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage more than 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazole showed a superior efficacy compared to placebo in the reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic traits, Aripiprazole showed a versus placebo-superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect that was comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazole also showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania, such as lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic traits, which sometimes did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole resulted in superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had reached a remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilisation stage before randomisation, Aripiprazole showed superiority over the prevention of bipolar disorder, mainly in the prevention of a relapse in the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the hydroxyulation of Aripiprazole and N-Dealkyness is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination time is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole in extensive metabolites via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours for poor '(=' poor ') metabolites via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, and in a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients no gender-dependent effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="91">A popup-specific analysis of pharmacokinetics did not reveal any clinically significant differences in terms of ethnic origin or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose trial in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated application, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or exposures that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have limited or no importance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included dose-dependent non-kidney toxicity (Lipofuscin-Pigment Accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans) and an increase of adrenal-kidney cancer and combined adrenal cortex-adenomas / carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (10 times the average Steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">Furthermore, a cholelithiasis was detected as a result of the precipitation of sulfate-conjugates of Aripiprazole in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1 to 3 times the mean steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the recommended maximum dose in humans (based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations of hydroxy- Aripiprazole found in the human bile at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg are no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the gall of monkeys, and are far below the limit values (6%) of the in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages which led to exposures of the 3- and 11-fold of the central Steady State AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="144">Once it is clinically appropriate, the treatment with Aripiprazole injection solution should be terminated and commenced with oral application of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="145">To increase the absorption and minimise the variability, an injection into the M. deltoideus or deep into the gluteus maximus muscle is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on the individual clinical status, taking into account the medicines already used for maintenance or acutely treatment (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a further oral treatment with Aripiprazole is indicated, see the summary of the features of the drug to Abilify tablets, Abilify Melting tablets or Abilify solution for taking.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no investigations on the efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution in patients with intoxication and behavioural disorders, which were otherwise caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to Aripiprazole injection solution, patients should be observed regarding extreme sedation or a blood pressure drop (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Studies on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (by prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazole should be administered cautiously in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, insufficiency), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose of hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering medicines) or hypertension (including celery and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports about dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, stiffness, varying levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and arrhythmia).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydips, polyurie, polyphagy and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored in terms of deteriorating glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenia patients and patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared to that after the exclusive application of Aripiprazole, in a study where healthy volunteers Aripiprazole (15 mg dose) were used as one-time addition intramuscularly and simultaneously received Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="157">The H2 antagonist famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolites, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole in comparison with CYP2D6 Extensive Metabolites.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- protease inhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After replacing the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose height before starting the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly received, the intensity of sedation was greater compared to that after exclusive application of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with Aripiprazole injection solution more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant adverse events (*) (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">107 The following adverse events occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant adverse events (*) in clinical trials (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment and 13.1% in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">Another study of 12 weeks showed the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those with lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18,2% was for patients treated with Aripiprazole and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">CPK increases (creatinphosphate kinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">The side effects associated with an antipsychotic therapy are the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesired cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders were the Aripiprazole injection solution with statistically significant greater improvements of astral / behavioural disorders associated with placebo and was similar to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder, as well as aspiration and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazole injection solution was associated with a statistically significant stronger improvement in the symptoms regarding intoxication and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The average improvement from baseline to the PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour final score was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of sub-groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe aggregation, a similar effectiveness was observed regarding the total population, but a statistical significance could be determined based on a decreased number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In one haloperidol-controlled study, in week 52 the proportion of responder patients who had a response to study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% (oral) and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values of measurement scales, which were defined as secondary educational goals, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression scale, showed significantly stronger improvement than at haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole (oral) showed a significantly higher decline in the rate of return, which was 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an Olantap-controlled, multi-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target was "weight gain," in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg) with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic traits, which sometimes did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole resulted in superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study extension in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilisation phase before randomisation, Aripiprazole showed superiority over the prevention of bipolar disorder, mainly in the prevention of a relapse in the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">The Aripiprazole AUC is 90% higher in the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection of the same dose as tablet; systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers, the average plasma levels were up to 3 hours after the maximum plasma level reached.</seg>
<seg id="184">The application of Aripiprazole injection solution was tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated exposure to systemic exposure (AUC), which were 15- or 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on the reproducibility of intravenous application, no safety-relevant concerns were observed after maternal exposure, which was 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) above the maximum humanistic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with Aripiprazole (oral) for safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or exposures that exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans; thus, they have limited or no importance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included dose-dependent non-kidney toxicity (Lipofuscin-Pigment Accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans) and an increase of adrenal-kidney cancer (AUC) at 60 mg / kg / day (the 10 times of the average steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">Furthermore, a cholelithiasis was detected as a result of the precipitation of sulfate-conjugates of Aripiprazole in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1 to 3 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the recommended maximum dose in humans (based on mg / m2).</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, about three quarters of which had previously received an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in single gift or monotherapy) was compared with the drug containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">Overall, in the main study 72 (31%) of the 229 patients treated with Abraxane were treated to treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients receiving conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">Only those patients who were treated for the first time in metastatic breast cancer have seen no difference between the drugs in terms of efficacy indicators, such as time to worsening disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">In contrast, patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may also not be used in patients who have low neutrophils in the blood before the treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee on Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) noted that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel and that unlike other paclitaxel drugs, drugs should not be given with other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission granted the company Abraxis BioScience Limited a permit for the transport of Abraxane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anthracycline-containing treatment is not shown (see also Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophal count &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the subsequent series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In sensory neuropathy degree 3 the treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is achieved to degrees 1 or 2, and in all subsequent cycles, the dose must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="278">There are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose changes in patients with mild to moderate impairment of liver function (see section 4.4. and 5.2).</seg>

<seg id="280">Abraxane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="281">Abraxane is an albumin-bound Nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel which could have significantly different pharmacological characteristics than other paclitaxel formulations (see Section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should be immediately removed and a symptomatic treatment is initiated, and the patient must not be treated with paclitaxel again.</seg>
<seg id="283">In patients no renewed abraxane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neutrophal count increased again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thrombocyte number increased again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver function disorders (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">While a clearly-related cardiotoxicity has not been proven, cardiac outages in the indicated patient population are not unusual, especially in patients with previous anthracycline treatment or underlying cardiac or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">If patients receive nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea after the application of Abraxane, they can be treated with the usual antiemetic and constipating means.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used in pregnant women or in childbearing age who do not have effective contraception, except for the treatment of mother with paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should use a reliable method of contraception during and up to one month after treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients treated with Abraxane are advised not to produce a child during and up to six months after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised prior to treatment using a blockage service, since the treatment with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as fatigue (very frequent) and dizziness (often) affecting the perspiration and ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events that occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in the pivotal clinical phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most prominent hematological toxicity (in 79% of patients reported) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 shows the side effects that have occurred in combination with the gift of Abraxane as monotherapy for each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: elevated blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatinine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, flatulence, tongue burning, dry mouth, pain in the gums, loose stool, oesophagitis, pain in the abdomen, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the abdominal wall, weakness of muscles, neck pain, groin pain, muscle spasms, pain in skeletal muscles, flank pain, discomfort in limbs, muscle weakness very often:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite in related case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no causal connection with these events was established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an anti-microtubules active agent that promotes the consolidation of the microtubules from the tubules and stabilizes the microtubules by inhibiting their deolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network that is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates transcytosis of plasma components into endothelial cells and in in-vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendthelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 albuminate receptor and a paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the tumour occurs due to the albuminant protein SPARC (sected protein acidic rich in cysteine).</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single-arm unrelated studies and 454 patients treated in a randomised Phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In one study, 43 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion for over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion for over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicentre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a paclitaxel chemotherapy every 3 weeks, either in the form of solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2, or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 versus 30 minutes infusion (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had a negative overall condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had previously not received chemotherapy, 27% had only adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only for metastasis and 19% due to metastasis and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression-free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; First-Line therapy are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity versus paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced peripheral neuropathy grade 3 at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy to decay at baseline based on the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the overall paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute injections of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was measured in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The exposure to active ingredients (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml, analogously to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After IV administration of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multi-phase manner.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume indicates a far-reaching extravascularisation and / or connection with paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel after intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane were compared with the results after a 3 hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearance of paclitaxel was higher (43%) after Abraxane administration than after a solvent-containing paclitaxel and also the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers, paclitaxel is metabolized primarily to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma, the average total daily intake of the unmodified active ingredient was 4% of the total dose of 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p hydroxypaclitaxel, indicating a far-reaching non-renal clearance.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data are available about patients at the age of over 75 years, since only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">The chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and in light of light protected over 8 hours.</seg>
<seg id="325">Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anti-carcinogenic drug and, as with other potentially toxic substances, care should be taken care of when dealing with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="326">Using a sterile syringe, it is slowly injected over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride infusion solution into a Abraxane gas bottle.</seg>
<seg id="327">After complete encore of the solution, the water bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure good use of the solid material.</seg>
<seg id="328">Then the water bottle should be turned slowly and cautiously for at least 2 minutes and / or inverted until a complete reset of the powder is done.</seg>
<seg id="329">If precipitations or drinkers are visible, the water bottle must be inverted gently to achieve complete absorption before application.</seg>
<seg id="330">The exact total dose volume of the 5 mg / ml-suspension, which is necessary for the patient, is calculated and the corresponding amount of reconstituted Abraxane is injected into an empty, sterile PVC- or non-PVC infusion bag.</seg>

<seg id="358">• Training brochure • Summary of the features of the medicine (specialist information), labelling and packing. • With unique imaging of the correct application of the product, cold boxes for transport by patients.</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "this means that Abseamed is similar to a biological medicinal product that is already approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same substance (also called" "" "reference medicaments" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood vessels, in which complications may occur if a blood transfusion is not possible and a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is not possible before surgery.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with Abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a self-blood donation, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection may also be carried out by the patient or his supervisor, provided that they have received appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">Patients with chronic renal insufficiency or patients receiving chemotherapy should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients must be inspected prior to treatment in order to ensure that there is no iron deficiency, and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy or in patients with kidney problems anaemia can be caused by an erythropoietine deficiency or that the body does not respond adequately to the body's own erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which it empowers to form epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared as an injection into a vein as part of a major study of 479 patients suffering from anaemia caused by kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study were injected at least eight weeks for Eprex / Erypo into a vein before they were either converted to Abseamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of the efficacy was the change in the hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of the skin sprayed in the skin have been studied with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from anaemia caused by kidney problems, the hemoglobin values of patients who were converted to Abseamed were maintained to the same extent as those patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison with this, the patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0,063 g / dl of the output value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which occasionally leads to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, smelling migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Seamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are needed to make sure that this does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee on Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that for Abseamed according to EU directives, evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that manufactures abseamed will provide information packages for medical personnel in all Member States, including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission granted the company Medice Medicce Pütter GmbH & Co KG a permit for the placing of abseamed across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphomas or multiple myeloma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of transfusion is due to the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, preexisting anaemia at the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">The treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate anemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8,1 mmol / l], if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, in case of planned larger surgical interventions which require a large volume of blood in women; 5 or more units blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">For the reduction of foreign blood, Abseamed can be used before a large elective orthopaedic surgery in adults with no iron deficiency, where high risk of transfusion complications is expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml, which can not participate in an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">Hemoglobin concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for paediatric patients, in which the hemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Anaemia symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and total illness; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in hemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can occasionally be observed via or below the hemoglobin concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">Given this hemoglobin variability, an appropriate dose management should be attempted to achieve the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the lasting haemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin alfa dose should be reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose, which is required for the control of anaemia and the symptoms of anemia.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.75 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with less severe initial anaemia (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with the initial anaemia less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.E. / kg three times a week by an intravenous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.E. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Anaemia symptoms and subsequent releases can be different depending on age, gender and total illness; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="396">Given this hemoglobin variability, an appropriate dose management should be attempted to achieve the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose, which is required for the control of the anaemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 treatment weeks the hemoglobin value is increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the reproducible number of ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the baseline value, the dose of 150 I.E. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.E. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin increase is &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the reproducible number &lt; 40.000 cells / µl compared to the baseline value, the dose should be raised to 300 I.E. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.E. / kg (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the reproducible number ≥ 400 cells / µl, the dose of 300 I.E. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the hemoglobin value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) or the reticulozytes number by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, a response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anaemia (haematocrit 33 - 39%), in which the precautionary storage of ≥ 4 blood canned foods is required, should receive a dose of 600 I.E. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks prior to surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">The iron substitution should start as soon as possible - e.g. several weeks before the autologous blood donation program begins, so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the seamed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.E. / kg epoetin alfa, which should be given once weekly for three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">In this case epoetin alfa should be preoperatively 300 I.E. / kg on 10 consecutive days, on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection at the end of dialysis can be given via the hose of a fistula needle followed by 10 ml isotonic saline solution to rinse the hose and ensure an adequate injection of the drug to the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients who develop with any erythropoetin on an erythroblastomy (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive an abseamed or other erythropoetin (see Section 4.4 - erythroblastoma).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within one month before the treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (e.g. anamnestic known venous thromboembolia).</seg>
<seg id="409">The use of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in patients who are unable to participate in an autologous blood donation program: severe coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial occlusion, vascular disease of carotid or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cerebrovascular accident.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastoma (PRCA) Very rare has been reported on the occurrence of an anti-body mediated PRCA after months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of action, defined as a decrease in haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased demand for transfusions, the reproducible value should be determined and the usual causes for non-contact (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium toxication, infections or inflammation, blood loss and hemolysis) are investigated.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the reticuloid is low (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 20,000 / microliter or &lt; 0.5%), thrombocyte and leukocyte numbers are normal, and if no other cause of a loss is found, the anti-erythropoetin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone marrow should be considered to be a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">Data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients with a risk of an anti-body induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of the hemoglobin target concentrations in section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials an increased risk of mortality and risk of severe cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given a haemoglobin target concentration of over 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit to the ability of epoetine if the hemoglobin concentration is increased by means of the concentration needed to control seizures and avoid blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The haemoglobin increase should amount to about 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinically active coronary heart disease or congestive heart disease or congestive heart disease, the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentrations, recommended in section 4.2, should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are not yet to be dialysis, is not accelerated by the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">Tumour patients receiving chemotherapy should consider a 2-3-week delay between epoetin-alfa administration and erythropoetin response (patients who may need to be transacted) for evaluating the therapeutic efficiency of epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is higher than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2, in order to minimize the risk of potential thrombotic events (see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapic anemia - dose adaptation with the aim of holding the haemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to apply recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment involving the respective patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are intended for a larger elective orthopaedic surgery, if possible, before beginning epoetin-alfa therapy the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients who undergo a larger elective orthopaedic surgery should receive appropriate thrombosis prophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, an increased risk of post-operative thrombotic / vasculartic events can not be ruled out for patients with epoetin alfa for patients with an initial case of &gt; 13 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled studies, epoetine was not proven to improve overall survival for tumor patients with symptomatic anaemia or to reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy, when a hemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was targeted</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporin dose can be adjusted to the rising haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies on tumor tissues there are no indications of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF regarding hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">About thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemia, cerebral ischemic attacks, cerebrosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary thromboses, aneurysms, retinal thromboses, and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients with epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the worsening of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovasculine events (see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients treated with erythropoetine.</seg>

<seg id="575">In the case of Morbus Paget, Aclasta was tested in two studies of 357 patients and compared with Risedronate (another bisphosphonate) for six months.</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicator of efficacy was whether the alkaline phosphatase in the serum (an enzyme that decomposes bone substance) normalized in the blood again or decreased by at least 75% compared to baseline value.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women, the risk of eddy fractures in patients suffering from Aclasta (without any other osteoporosis medicine) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared to the patients.</seg>
<seg id="578">Comparing all patients with Aclasta (with or without any other osteoporosis medicine) with those taking placebo the risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41%.</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study involving men and women with hip fracture, 9% of patients suffering from Aclasta had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of patients taking placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most side effects of Aclasta occur within the first three days after the infusion and are less common in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to coledronyric acid or other bisphosphonates or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients at Aclasta are subject to risk of kidney problems, infusion and osteoarthritis (bone tissue death) in the jaw.</seg>

<seg id="587">The patient information package is to be provided and the following key messages include: • Contract contraindication in pregnancy and lactating women • Required for adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non-smoking and healthy nutrition • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to access medical or nursing assistance</seg>
<seg id="588">Treatment of osteoporosis • in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, an IV infusion of 5 mg Aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, the administration of the infusion of Aclasta is recommended for two or more weeks following the operative care of the hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclasta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After treatment of the patient with Aclasta, a long remission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is very advisable to ensure an adequate intake of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget twice daily at least 500mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recently established low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.E. oralem or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of acetamol or ibuprofen can be reduced shortly after the application of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with renal function disorder (see section 4.4) For patients with a Creatinin Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended since limited clinical experience is available for this patient group.</seg>
<seg id="597">Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) A dose adjustment is not necessary because bioavailability, distribution and elimination are similar to older patients as in younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18, as data on safety and efficacy are lacking.</seg>
<seg id="599">For patients with severe renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min), Aclasta is not recommended since only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Preexisting hypokalcemia should be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D prior to the treatment with Aclasta (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid insertion of the effects of coledronylic acid to bone reconstruction, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia develops whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days following the infusion of Aclasta (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is very advisable to ensure an adequate intake of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget twice daily at least 500mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene) should be considered before applying bisphosphonates with appropriate preventive dental treatment.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients who require dental treatment, no data is available if the interruption of treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteotic rosis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">Clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for each patient's treatment plan and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days of administration of acetamol or ibuprofen can be reduced shortly after the application of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of atrial fibrillation reported in patients who received Aclasta increased (1.3%) (51 from 3,862) compared to patients who received placebo (0.6%) (22 out of 3.852).</seg>
<seg id="608">The overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable in the osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON).</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse drug interactions are listed in table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Kidney function disorder, Zoledronutrient, was associated with renal dysfunctions which expressed itself as a decrease in the renal function (i.e. an increase in serum creatine) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the Creatinin Clearance (measured every year before the administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a restricted renal function were comparable in a clinical study of osteoporosis over three years between the Aclasta- and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatinins within 10 days of the administration was observed in 1.8% of patients treated with aclasta compared to 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of laboratory findings, the transient asymptomatic calcium levels (less than 2.10 mmol / l) were observed in 2.3% of patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical study compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the patients treated with the disease.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received supplementary sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the postmenopausal osteoporosis study, in the study on the prevention of clinical fractures following a hip fracture and in the Morbus Paget studies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a recent hip fracture, vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions following the administration of Zoledronutrient in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the infusion site, such as redness, swelling and / or pain (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteotic rosis in the jaw area has been studied, especially in cancer patients, via osteoecrosis (primarily in the jaw area), which were treated with bisphosphonates, including zoledronylic acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and the majority of reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental interferons.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 patients with 7,736 patients treated osteoarthritis in the jaw area of a patient treated with Aclasta and a placebo treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the case of an overdose which leads to clinically relevant hypokalcemia, a compensation of oral calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate can be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical efficacy in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was indicated in postmenopausal women (7,736 women between 65 and 89 years) with either a bone density value (BMD) -T-Score for the femal hals ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing vertebral fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on the Aclasta morphometric body fractures significantly decreased over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or several new spinal fractures (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Patients aged 75 and older had a 60% reduced risk of spinal fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclasta showed a consistent effect over three years which resulted in reduced risk for hip fractures by 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased bone density in the lumbar spine, hip and distal radius compared with placebo treatment significantly at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase of the bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the total hip by 6.0%, the lower arm by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology In 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70), one year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies from the pool crest were taken.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase in trabecular bone volumes and the preservation of trabecular bone architecture compared with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminale propeptide of the type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and beta-C telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 in periods during study duration.</seg>
<seg id="630">After 12 months, the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Aclasta reduced significantly by 30% compared to baseline and was maintained at 28% below the baseline value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the baseline value after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the baseline value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50.000 to 125,000 I.E. orally or intramuscularly) 2 weeks before the infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">Total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT study, the Aclasta treatment in comparison with placebo-treatment increased the BMD at all times.</seg>
<seg id="636">Compared to placebo, the Aclasta treatment led to an increase in BMD by 5.4% in total and 4.3% on the Schenkelbow.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON-RFT study 58 men were randomised, and in 185 patients the BMD was evaluated after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the frequency of clinical fractures was 7.5% in Aclasta-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in males (Study CZOL446M2308), the once annual administration of Aclasta was not inferior to the percentage change in the lumbar vertebra BMD after 24 months compared to the baseline value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical effectiveness of the treatment in the disease of the bone Aclasta was studied in patients and patients at the age of 30 with radiologically confirmed, mainly light to moderately heavy disease Paget of the bone (mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase equal to 2.6x to 3.0x age-specific upper normal value when taking into the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg zoledronyric acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of risedronate once daily for 2 months was demonstrated in two six-month comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar reduction in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the baseline for Aclasta and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as Responder at the end of the six-month main study (responded to the therapy) could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 patients treated with aclasta and the 107 patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response was maintained in 141 of patients treated with aclasta compared to 71 patients treated with Risedronate in the mean follow-up period of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-off and multiple 5 and 15 minute infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg zoledronyric acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data which proved to be dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After this, the plasma level decreased rapidly to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 hours and &lt; 1% after 24 hours, followed by a very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearing from the large circulation system with half-life t ½ a 0,24 and t ½ to 1.87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a terminale eliminatory period t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early part phases (α and β, with the above t ½ -values) represent probably the rapid absorption in bones and excretion over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly bonded to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body Clearance amounts to 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by sex, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of Zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the area below the curve (plasma concentration for time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced clearance of metabochromy P450 enzyme systems is unlikely because zoledronutrient is not metabolized in humans and because they are a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, metabolism-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal clearance of coledronyric acid correlated with the Creatinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinous-Clearance, and in the 64 examined patients in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a light (Clcr = 50 - 80 ml / min) and a moderate renal function disturbance down to a creatinin Clearance up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of coledronyric acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">As for severe renal dysfunctions (creatine clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data are available, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-lethal injection intravenous single dose in mice was 10 mg / kg body weight and at rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In trials on dogs single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC the 6fold of recommended human-therapeutic exposure) were administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Chronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous application, the renal tolerability of coledronyric acid in rats was given by doses of 0.6 mg / kg as 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals (a cumulative dose equivalent to the 7x of the human-therapeutic exposure related to AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated use of cumulated exposures that exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects were observed in other organs including gastrointestinal tract and liver, as well as at the intravenous injection point.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most frequent occurrence in trials with repeated use was an increased primary Spongiosa in the Metaphysis of long bones in animals in the growth phase with nearly all dosages, a finding that reflects the pharmacological, anti-absorptive action of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats followed a teratogenicity in dosages from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal (viscerale) abnormalities and such of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed on rabbits, although the maternal toxicity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of a low serum calcium level.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledronutrient is a representative of a substance called bisphosphonate and is used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and the bone Paget of the bone.</seg>
<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, especially estrogens that are made of androgens, play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">With the Morbus Paget, bone reconstruction takes place too fast, and new bone material is structured randomly, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta works by normalising the bone structure, thereby ensuring a normal bone formation and thus reinforces the bone again strength.</seg>
<seg id="675">If you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery, tell your doctor that you are treated with Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="676">When using Aclasta with other medicines, please inform your doctor, pharmacist or nursing staff if you have any other medicine or have taken / used recently / used, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="677">It is particularly important for your doctor to know if you are taking the medicine that is known to damage the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="678">When using Aclasta along with food and drinks, you should be concerned that according to your doctor's instructions, you should drink enough liquid before and after the treatment with Aclasta.</seg>

<seg id="681">The usual dose is 5 mg, which is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as infusion into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="682">Because Aclasta works for a long time, you may need another dose after one year or longer.</seg>
<seg id="683">It is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in your blood after infusion.</seg>
<seg id="684">With Morbus Paget, Aclasta can work longer than a year, and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment.</seg>

<seg id="686">Before completing the treatment with Aclasta If you are considering the termination of treatment with Aclasta, please take your next doctor's appointment and discuss it with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="687">Side effects associated with the first infusion are very common (in more than 30% of patients), but are less common after subsequent infusions.</seg>
<seg id="688">Fever and chills, muscle or joint pain and headaches, occur within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Research Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) where metformin (a diabetes drug) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be used in addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients) who cannot be satisfactorily adjusted with metformin alone in the highest compatible dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonyl resins or insulin, the present dose of the sulfonyl resins or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Actos treatment except for patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here the dose of the sulfonyl resins or insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sinks, making type 2 diabetes better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Actos was studied in tripletherapy; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonyl resin, in addition, they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos launched a lowering of the HbA1c value, suggesting that blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg dosage.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional administration of Actos for the existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonyl resins showed a reduction of HbA1c values by 0.94%, while the additional dose of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study where the combination of Actos and insulin was studied in 289 patients, patients who took Actos in addition to insulin decreased the HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months compared to 0.14% in the patients who took additional placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were visual disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections, weight gain and hypotheses (reduced sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or any of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, congestive heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high concentration levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited authorisation for the placing of accounts in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">"" "the tablets are white to whitish, round, arched and carry on one side the marking" "" "15" "" "and on the other hand the inscription" "" "Actos" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and is unsuitable for metformin due to contraindications or intolerance (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available for use of pioglitazone in patients under the age of 18, so the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients with at least one risk factor (e.g. previous heart attack or symptomatic coronary artery disease), the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on symptoms and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with a reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with Pioglitazone in patients less than 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preexisting advanced macular vascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports on heart failure, which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with elevated output liver enzyme (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazone cannot be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme levels are to be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms which point to hepatic dysfunction such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme levels must be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision to continue the treatment of the patient with Pioglitazone should be conducted by clinical evaluation until the laboratory parameters have been established.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, a dose-dependent weight gain has been proven that can stir from fatty deposits and in some cases is associated with fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of hemodilution, a slight reduction of the mean haemoglobin (relative reduction by 4%) and haematocrit (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred under the treatment with Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparing controlled trials with pioglitazone in patients with metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4% and hematoglobin by 3.1% and hematoglobin by 1-2% and hematoglobin by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive pioglitazone as oral two- or triple-combination therapy with a sulfonyl resins or as bipolar combination therapy with insulin have the risk of dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, a reduction of visual acuity was reported under the treatment with thiazoldindia, including pioglitazone, an occurrence or worsening of a diabetic macular edema.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct link between the intake of pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular edema when patients report disturbances of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of undesirable events concerning bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1,9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures of 44 / 870 (5,1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patient years) were compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, and if a patient wishes to have pregnancy or this occurs, treatment is deprecated (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies evaluating the interactions have shown that Pioglitazone does not exert any relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with drugs which are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrosis (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">Simultaneous use of pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a 54% reduction in the AUC of Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the reduction of hyperinsulinemia resulting in the pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal by treatment with Pioglitazone which reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very often &gt; 1 / 10; frequently &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100; rarely &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (not invaluable in this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turgor and the refractive index of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycaemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with pioglitazone ALT-Anstiege was more frequent than placebo, but less frequently than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonyl resins.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with preexisting advanced macular vascular disease, the incidence of severe heart failure under Pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than placebo, when Pioglitazone or Pioglitazone respectively.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch rarely has been reported on cardiac insufficiency in Pioglitazone, but more often if Pioglitazone has been used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of reports of adverse events related to bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with pioglitazone and more than 7,400 patients treated with comparative medications was conducted.</seg>
<seg id="796">Over a period of 3.5 years running ProActive, fractures at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone were compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occured.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to have an activated Receptor-γ activation (PPAR-γ) activation of specific nuclear receptors (PPAR-γ), leading to increased insulin sensitivity in liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazone reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose tolerance in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazone versus Gliclaity as monotherapy was continued over two years in order to study the time to follow the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8,0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the onset of therapy a blood glucose control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8,0%) could be maintained by means of pioglitazone in 69% of treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclaity).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was insufficient despite three months of optimizing insulin had been randomized to pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients suffering from Pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c was 0.45% compared to the patients who continued to receive only insulin; a reduction in insulin dosage in the treated group was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin ratio was consistently statistically significant compared to the baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small study of type 2 diabetes in a small, 18-week study.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, compared to placebo, a reduction of total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol levels were observed as well as slightly, but clinically not significantly elevated LDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, pioglitazone compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclaity reduced the total plaszeride levels and the free fatty acids and increased HDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol levels was observed under Pioglitazone, whereas low levels of metformin and liclaity were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a 20-week study, Pioglitazone not only reduced the triglycerides, but also improved the post-dialydial triglyceride levels, both on triglyceride absorption as well as the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preexisting advanced macular vascular disease were randomized in groups who received either Pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After orally application, Pioglitazone is absorbed quickly, with the peak concentrations of unaltered pioglitazone in plasma normally 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV is equivalent to the effectiveness of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, Pioglitazone has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">Simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrosis (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After orally application of radioactive pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in the index (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma elimination time of unmodified pioglitazone is 5-6 hours in humans, and the total active metabolites are 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of Pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers, but the rates of oral clearance of the mother substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">Toxicological studies were observed in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume increase with hemodilution, anemia and reversibly eccentrically hypertrophie.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the reduction of hyperinsulinemia resulting from the treatment with Pioglitazone which reduces the mother's insulin resistance and reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) was induced by the bladder epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other thiazoldindia resulted in increased colonic tumors.</seg>

<seg id="823">The calculated fracture incidence was 1,9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures of 44 / 870 (5,1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patient years) were compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin were studied with respectively Pioglitazone or Gliclasis.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin ratio was statistically significant compared to the baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone not only reduced the triglycerides but also improved the post-dendial increased triglyceride levels, both through an effect on tryglyceride absorption as well as on hepatic trygjournerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study lacked the target of its primary endpoint, a combination of the total mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary artery disease, leg amputation above the ankle, coronary revascularization and vascularization of the leg arteries, the results suggest that the intake of Pioglitazone does not involve cardiovascular long-term risks.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actraphane has been studied to 294 patients with type 1 diabetes, where the pancreas cannot produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="865">In the study, after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance (glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured, which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane led to a decrease in the HbA1c level which suggested that blood sugar levels were similar to another human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, the doses of Actraphane need to be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar (the full list is to be found in the package insert).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee on Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Actraphane were outweighed in the treatment of diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission granted Novo Nordisk A / S a licence for the placing of Actraphane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-mixed insulin products are normally used once or twice daily if a rapid initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect.</seg>

<seg id="873">Patients whose blood glucose levels have improved significantly, for example, by intensified insulin therapy, can change the hypoglycemia's warning symptoms and should accordingly be advised.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change concerning starch, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (fast acting, biphasic, long-acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin analog) and / or production method (recombinant DNA in animal origin) may cause a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="875">If a dose adjustment is required when switching to Actraphane in the patient, it may be necessary at the first dosage or during the first weeks or months after the changeover.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients with hypoglycaemic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different than with their previous insulin.</seg>

<seg id="1188">Liver diseases During phase 3 clinical trials, minor signs of liver function values were observed in patients treated with Febuxostat (3.5%).</seg>
<seg id="1189">It is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before beginning the febuxoat treatment and in the course of the course (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophylline zine did not conduct any interaction studies on Febuxostat, but it is known that the XO inhibition can lead to an increase in theophyllic acid (an inhibiting of the metabolism of theophylline was also reported for other XO inhibitors).</seg>
<seg id="1191">In subjects, Febuxostat and naproxen were also associated with an increase in Febuxostat exposure (CMAx 28%, AUC 41% and t1 / 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical trials, the use of naproxen or other NSAR / Cox-2 inhibitors was not related to a clinically significant increase in adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicin / Indometacin / Hydrochlorothiazide / Warfarin Febuxostat can be used together with Colchicin or Indometacin without the need for a dose adjustment for Febuxostat or the other active ingredient used at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study with subjects 120 mg ADENURIC 1 x had an average 22% increase in AUC from Desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, indicating a possible weak inhibitory effect of Febuxostat on the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Antazida It could be shown that simultaneous intake of an antacids containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide has slowed the absorption of Febuxostat (about 1 hour) and a decrease in CMAx by 32%, but no significant change in AUC.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregnancies may not close to side effects of Febuxostat on the pregnancy or the health of the fetus / newborn.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Animal studies do not cause direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development or birth (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="1198">Patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle, serving machines or in the exercise of dangerous activities until they can reasonably be sure that ADENURIC does not adversely affect their performance.</seg>
<seg id="1199">A numerically higher incidence of the cardiovascular events reported by the investigator was observed in the overall febuxostatgroup in the pivotal study of Phase 3 (1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years) and in long-term extension studies (1,4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years), although no statistically significant differences were found and no causal connection with Febuxostat could be detected.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The risk factors identified in these patients were arteriosclerotic disease and / or a myocardial infarction or a cardiac insufficiency in the medical history.</seg>
<seg id="1201">Frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100) and rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000) side effects, which could be found in the treatment groups of 80 mg / 120 mg of Febuxostat and which were reported more than once in all Febuxostat treatment groups, are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting are more common in patients treated with colchicin at the same time. * * In clinical trials there were no serious rashes or serious hypersensitivity reactions observed.</seg>
<seg id="1203">7 Offered long-term extension studies In open long-term extension studies, 906 patients were treated for up to 1 year, 322 patients up to 2 years long, 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients up to 4 years long with Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1204">The events related to long-term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies (see table 1).</seg>
<seg id="1205">The following treatment-related events were reported more than once in all Febuxostat- treatment groups and occurred in patients who received Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg in long-term extension studies (up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,900 patient years), according to information occasionally.</seg>
<seg id="1206">The following treatment-related events were either not reported at all in the pivotal studies of phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Diabetes, hyperlipidemia, insomnia, pesthesia, conspicuous ECG, coughing, bursitis, protein urie, renal insufficiency, erectile dysfunction, increase in the concentration of potassium in the blood, increase in lymphocytes, decrease in the number of white blood cells.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The mechanism of active uric acid is the end product of the purinmetabolism in humans and arises as part of the reaction skade hypoxanthin → Xanthin → Teuric acid.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Febuxostat is a potent, non-purin-selective inhibitor of the XO (NP-SIxO) with a Ki value for in vitro Hemp which lies below the nanomolar range.</seg>
<seg id="1210">Clinical study results The efficacy of ADENURIC was shown in two pivotal studies of phase 3 (APEX study and FACT study as described below), which were conducted with 1,832 patients with hyperuricemia and gout.</seg>
<seg id="1211">The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly Serumharnsowings levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="1212">Placebo (n = 134), ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily (n = 269), ADENURIC 240 mg 1 x daily (n = 269), ADENURIC 240 mg 1 x daily (n = 10) for patients with a serum creatine value at the start of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1213">The APEX study showed the statistically significant superiority of the treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with commonly used doses of Allopurinol 300 mg (n = 258) / 100 mg (n = 10).</seg>
<seg id="1214">The FACT study showed statistically significant superiority in both treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared with the conventional dose of Allopurinol 300 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Patients with serum creatinine values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl) or 300 mg 1 x daily (n = 509) were combined for the analyses. * p &lt; 0.001 versus Allopurinol, # p &lt; 0.001 versus 80 mg</seg>
<seg id="1216">Lowering the serum resin acid level to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) was observed during the doctor visit in week 2 and maintained permanently throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1217">509 patients received allopurinol 300 mg 1 x daily; 10 patients with serum creatine values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl were given 100 mg 1 x daily.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with renal function restriction The APEX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with renal function restriction (D).</seg>
<seg id="1219">ADENURIC was the primary efficacy endpoint at 44% (80 mg 1 x daily), 45% (120 mg 1 x daily) and 60% (240 mg 1 x daily) of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1220">There were no clinically significant differences in the percentage of serumina acid concentrations in subjects, irrespective of their renal function (58% in the group with normal kidney function and 55% in the group with severe kidney function disorders).</seg>
<seg id="1221">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with serum resins ≥ 10 mg / dl of Etwa 40% of patients (APEX and FACT study) had a serum resin concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study (baseline).</seg>
<seg id="1222">The data from the open extension study of Phase 3 revealed in two years that the permanent reduction of serum resin levels was reduced to &lt; 6mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l), so that less than 3% of patients needed a treatment against rheumatism in the months 16-24 (i.e. more than 97% of patients did not need treatment against a supply of toxins).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the size of the burr, which resulted in 54% of patients a complete disappearance of the knot nodes by month 24.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased TSH- values (&gt; 5.5 µIE / ml) were observed in patients receiving long-term treatment with Febuxostat (5,0%) and receiving Allopurinol (5.8%) in open long-term extension studies (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy subjects, the maximum plasma concentrations (CMAx) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) from Febuxostat after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose is dose-proportional.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses of 120 mg and 300 mg, an increase in AUC is observed for Febuxostat, which is larger than the dose-proportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking single or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily, the CMAx amounts to about 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5,0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1228">However, no clinically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease in serum resin concentration, provided this was tested (multiple doses of 80 mg).</seg>
<seg id="1229">Distribution The apparent steady-state distribution volume (Vss / F) by Febuxostat is between 29 and 75 l after taking doses of 10-300 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The plasma binding of Febuxostat amounts to approximately 99.2% (primary binding of albumin) and is constant over the concentration width, which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1231">In vitro studies in human liver microscopy showed that these oxidative metabolites are mainly formed by CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C8 or CYP2C9, and that Febuxostatglucuronid is mainly caused by UGT 1A1, 1A8 and 1A9.</seg>
<seg id="1232">After taking an 80 mg dose of 14C-marked febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose in the urine was found to be unaltered fiebuxostat (3%), the known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (13%) as well as further unknown metabolites (3%).</seg>
<seg id="1233">In addition to excretion over the urine, about 45% of the dose in the stool was found to be unaltered fiebuxostat (12%), the known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (25%) as well as further unknown metabolites (7%).</seg>
<seg id="1234">After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild, moderate or severe kidney failure, the CMAx of Febuxostat did not change compared to subjects with normal kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The mean total AUC of Febuxostat increased by about 1.8 times of 7.5 μ of 7.5 μ y / ml in the group with normal kidney function at €13.2 μ continh / ml in the group with severe kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1236">12 Liver dysfunction after taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild (ChildPugh classification A) or moderate (Child-Pugh classification B) Liver function restriction did not significantly change the CMAx and AUC from Febuxostat and its metabolites significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Age There were no significant changes in regard to AUC from Febuxostat or its metabolites after taking multiple oral doses of ADENURIC in older patients compared to younger subjects.</seg>
<seg id="1238">Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility In male rats a statistically significant increase of bladder tumours (transition cell papillomas and carcinomas) was found only in connection with Xanthin stones in the highly dose treated group, approximately 11 times the exposure to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1239">These findings are seen as a result of a specific purinmetabolism and urinary composition and considered not relevant for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="1240">It was found that Febuxostat has no effect on the fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1241">At high doses, which were about 3 times the human therapeutic exposure, maternal toxicity occurred which accompanied by lowering the rearing performance and a developmental delay in the descendants of rats.</seg>
<seg id="1242">Teratological studies in supporting rats with expositions, which approximately the 4.3-fold and in trafic rabbit with expositions, which amounted to approximately 13 times the human therapeutic exposure, did not reveal any teratogenic effects.</seg>

<seg id="1276">The patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water (no mineral water) at least 30 minutes before eating, drinking or taking other medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements).</seg>
<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the oesophagus, the patient must not lie down until after the first dietary intake of the day, which should take place earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">As alendronate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union, the company presented data originating from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study of 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis to prove the efficacy of ADROVANCE in terms of enhancing vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with ADROVANCE was lower (11%) than those who received alendronate alone (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also presented data suggesting that the alendronat dose contained in ADROVANCE corresponds exactly to the dose required for the prevention of bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are headaches, pain of the locomotor system (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of digestive problems such as stomach pain, dyspepsia (digestive disorders), constipation, diarrhea (ulceration), vomiting (ulcera), drilled abdomen (bloated stomach) as well as acidic rearing.</seg>
<seg id="1283">In patients with any hypersensitivity to alendronate, vitamin D3 or any of the other components ADROVANCE must not be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1284">It must not be applied to diseases of the oesophagus, in patients with hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) or in patients who cannot stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes.</seg>

<seg id="1291">Esophageal reactions, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcerations and esophageal erosions, rarely followed by esophageal fractures, were reported in patients taking Alendronat (partially these were severe and required hospitalization).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible osteophageal reactions, and patients should be advised to suspend pain in swallowing or retrosternal pain or retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn, or seek medical advice (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of severe malignant adverse events appears to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or continue to take it after the appearance of symptoms that point to osteophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">Although no increased risk was found in large-scale clinical studies with Alendronat, stomach and duodenal ulcers, some of which were severe and associated with complications, were reported (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteoarthritis of the jaw, usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection (including osteomyelitis), was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regimen were predominantly administered intravenously and bisphosphonate.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There are no data available which indicate whether the removal of bisphosphonate therapy in patients who require a slate surgical procedure decreases the risk of osteoarthritis of the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Clinical evaluation by the treating physician is decisive for the planning of therapy for each patient based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Patients should be instructed that they should take a dose of ADROVANCE on the next morning after they have noticed their failure to take a dose of ADROVANCE.</seg>

<seg id="1302">Alendronate foods and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of alendronate when taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore, after taking Alendronat, wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines (see Sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not conducted, Alendronat was taken in clinical trials, together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines, without clinically relevant interactions.</seg>

<seg id="1403">In addition, the results of a clinical trial were presented to 668 patients with kidney transplantation, compared to Prograf / Prograft or Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1404">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplant was rejected after a treatment duration of one year (for example, by examining how often a renewed organ transplant or resumption of dialysis was required).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, shorter further studies were performed on 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplantation and examined how Advagraf is absorbed by the body in comparison with Prograf / Prograft.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and the treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tacrolimus this can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects, including under- or immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; changes of the formulation or regime should only be undertaken under close supervision of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of a change to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug control and corresponding dose adaptations must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in an individual case and on blood levels (see below "Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">Following changeover from Prograf to Advagraph, the tacrolim tallevels should be checked before the changeover and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Day 4 was the systemic exposure, measured as a talent level, with both formulations comparable to both kidney and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated checks of the Tacrolimus talk levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation into anagraf to ensure proper substance exposure during the immediate night transplant phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since tacrolimus is a low Clearance substance, an adjustment of the dose can take several days before the steady state is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1420">Duration of the application For the suppression of the graft rejection, immunosuppression must be maintained; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dose recommendations - kidney transplant prophylaxis of transplant rejection The oral Advagraf therapy should start with 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dose adaptations may be necessary later, as the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus can change during the course of the patient's stabilization after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dose recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of transplant rejection The oral Advagraf therapy should start with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - conversion from Prograf to Advagraf Is a graft recipient of twice daily dosage of prograf capsules to be converted to a once daily intake of Advagraf, so this conversion in ratio 1: 1 (mg: mg), related to the entire daily dose, has to take place.</seg>
<seg id="1425">After switching from other immunosuppressants to Advagraf once a day, the treatment with the oral initialdehyde recommended in Kidney and liver transplantation must commence for the prophylaxis of the graft rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplantation In adult patients who are switched to Advagraph, an oral Initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is to be taken once a day in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients, although there is no clinical experience with Advagraf in lung, pancreatic and colorectal patients, was used in a oral initials dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day for transplanted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosage adaptations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood flow in the targeted area, a reduction of the dose may be required in patients with severe liver function disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since the renal function does not exert an influence on the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, however, careful observation of the renal function (including a regular determination of the serum creatinaccuracy, a calculation of the creatinincalance and a monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Switching from Ciclosporin to Advagraf When switching from a Ciclosporine to a tacrolimus-based therapy is recommended (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">The dosage ought to be based primarily on the clinical assessment of repulsion and tolerability in an individual case with the aid of thoroughbred tacrolimus-tallevels controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tacrolimus-Talks during the first two weeks following transplantation, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-tallow levels of tacrolimus should also be controlled after changeover from Prograf to Advagraph, Dosage adjustments, changes of immunosuppressive therapy or while applying substances that could change the blood concentration of the Tacrolimus (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a medicine with a low Clearance, adjustments to the dose may require several days until the steady state has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The indications in clinical studies indicate that successful treatment in most cases is possible if the tallevels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the blood levels of tacrolimus in the whole blood are usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in case of kidney and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant receivers, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml have generally been used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects which may occur as a result of tacrolimus dorsal or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; changes of the formulation or regime should only be undertaken under close supervision of a medical device experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection associated with other immunosuppressive drugs, no clinical data is available for the retarded formulation Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">For prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplant recipients and recipients of transplant recipients, no clinical data is available for the retarded formulation Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of possible interactions that may lead to a lowering of the Tacrolimus levels in the blood and weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the use of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or other herbal remedies during treatment with Advagraph (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful observation of the tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is provided because the Tacrolimus blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, a corneal or septum hypertrophie referred to as cardiomyopathy has been observed, which can therefore occur under Advagraph.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart condition, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, fluid overload and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the potential risk of malignant skin lesions due to appropriate clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients taking Tacrolimus, symptoms for PRES such as headaches, altered state of consciousness, convulsions and visual disturbances should show a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In patients with rare hereditary galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption, Advagraf Hartcap, retardant, contains lactose.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and consequently increase or lower the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels while offering substances that can change the CYP3A's metabolism and adjust the tacrolimus dose to maintain even concentrations according to sections 4.2 and 4.4.</seg>
<seg id="1452">A highly distinctive interaction was achieved with antimycotics such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole and Voriconazole as well as with the Macrolid antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z.</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly resulted from the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus, caused by the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methyl prednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4-Hemmer; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus can be metabolized with medicines which are metabolized by CYP3A4 which interferes with their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since tacrolimus can reduce the clearance of steroid contraceptives and thus increase hormonal exposure, precautionary measures are especially cautious.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal studies have shown that tacrolimus could potentially reduce the clearing of pentobarbital and phenazone and prolong their half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of transplant patients have no indication that under tacrolimus compared to other immunosuppressants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In utero exposure, a monitoring of the newborn is recommended for possible harmful effects of tacrolimus (in particular with regard to its effect on the kidneys).</seg>

<seg id="1465">Infections and parasitic diseases As is known to be with other highly effective immunosuppressants, the susceptibility to infections (viral, bacterial, protozoals) is frequently increased in patients treated with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1466">Cases of BK-virus-associated nephropathy and JC virus-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) were reported in patients with immunosuppression therapy, including therapy with Advagraph.</seg>
<seg id="1467">Benign or malignant neoplasms including EBV-associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumours were reported in conjunction with tacrolimus treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high binding of erythrocytes and plasma roteins, it can be assumed that tacrolimus is not dialysis.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects On the molecular level, the effects of tacrolimus should be mediated by binding to a cytosolean protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for the enrichment of the connection within the cellular nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciumdependent inhibiting of signal transduction pathways in the T cell and thus prevents the transcription of a certain number of lymphocytes genes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus oppresses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T-helper cells, and the formation of lymphocytes (such as interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and γ-interferon) and the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="1472">12 confirmed acute outbreaks were 32,6% in the first 24 weeks in the Advagraf Group (N = 237) and 29.3% in the Prograf Group (N = 234).</seg>
<seg id="1473">Patients survival rates after 12 months were 89.2% for Advagraf and 90,8% for Prograf; in the Advagraf-Arm 25 (14 women, 11 males) and in prograf arm 24 (5 women, 19 men) died.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Kidney transplantation The efficacy and safety of Advagraf and Prograf was compared in combination with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and corticosteroids, at 667 de novo kidney transplants.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Patients survival rates after 12 months were 96.9% for Advagraf and 97.5% for Prograf; 10 (3 women, 7 men) and prograf arm 8 (3 women, 5 men) died.</seg>
<seg id="1476">The efficacy and safety of Prograf, Ciclosporin and Advagraf was compared in combination with Basiliximab antibodies, MMF and corticosteroids, at 638 de novo kidney transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The incidence of treatment failure after 12 months (defined as death, graft failure, biopsy confirmed acute rejection or missing follow-up data) was 14.0% in the group (N = 214), 15.1% in the Prograf group (N = 212) and 17.0% in the Ciclosporin group (N = 212).</seg>
<seg id="1478">The treatment difference was -3.0% (Advagraf- Ciclosporin) (95.2% confidence interval [-9.9%, 4.0%]) for Advagraf vs Ciclosporin and -1.9% (prograf Ciclosporin) for Prograf vs Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1479">In the anagraf-arm 3 (men), in prograf arm 10 (3 women, 7 men) and in Ciclosporin arm 6 (3 women, 3 men) died.</seg>
<seg id="1480">Published results of primary immunosuppression with tacrolimus in the form of twice daily prograf capsules after other primary organ transplants Prograf has developed into a recognized primary immunosuppressant after pancreatic, lung and intestinal transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1481">175 patient-transplanted patients, in 475 patients who underwent pancreatic transplantation and in 630 cases after an intestinal transplant were used as primary immunosuppressant.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral prograf in these published studies was consistent with the large studies in which prograf was used for primary immunosuppression in liver, renal and heart transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted, multicentre study with oral prograf, more than 110 patients were reported to either receive Tacrolimus or Ciclosporin within 1: 1 randomization.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic transplantation, bronchiolitis obliteracy syndrome, was also observed less frequently in the first year after the transplant (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the Tacrolimus- and 83% in the Ciclosporin group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the patients treated with tacrolimus, it came in 21.7% of cases for the development of bronchiolitis obliterans compared to 38.0% under Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases in which Ciclosporin had to be changed to tacrolimus was significantly greater (p = 0.02) than the number of patients encircled by Tacrolimus on Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which no acute graft rejection occurred after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in the lung transplanted patients of the Tacrolimus group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In one study the frequency of the emergence of bronchiolitis obliterated syndrome was significantly lower in the patients treated with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Pancreatic transplantation A multi-center trial with oral prograf was performed on 205 patients who simultaneously underwent pancreatic and kidney transplantation, which were randomised to receive Tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initialdosage (per protocol) of tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to reach the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml am 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">In 155 patients (65 only intestine, 75 liver and intestine and 25 multiviszerale transplants) showed an up-to-date survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Methods for early detection of Epstein-Barr (EBV) - and CMV infections, bone marrow enlargement, additional dose of the interleukin-2 antagonist daclizumab, lower initial doses of tacrolizumab, leading to sebassay between 10 and 15 ng / ml and recently graft radiation (Abu-Elmagd et al., Ann Surg 2001; 234: 404).</seg>
<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrit value and low protein concentrations, which lead to an increase in the unbound fraction of tacrolimus, or a strengthening of metabolism caused by corticosteroids should be responsible for the higher Clearance rates observed after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, with excretion mainly via bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">The systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) under Advagraph was approximately 10% lower than under Prograf for stable patients who were switched from Prograf (twice daily) to Advagraf (once daily) in relation to the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1497">It is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tacrolimus-Talks during the first two weeks following transplantation, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1498">21 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection associated with other immunosuppressive drugs, no clinical data is available for the retarded formulation Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1499">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart condition, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, fluid overload and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1500">28 confirmed acute outbreaks were 32,6% in the first 24 weeks in the Advagraf Group (N = 237) and 29.3% in the Prograf Group (N = 234).</seg>

<seg id="1508">In total, 34 patients from Ciclosporin were changed to tacrolimus, while only 6 Tacrolimus patients needed a different therapy (Bechstein et al., Transplantation 2004; 77: 1221).</seg>
<seg id="1509">In 155 patients (65 only intestine, 75 liver and intestine and 25 multiviszerale transplants) showed an up-to-date survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advances will be used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hemophilia A (a congenital blood clotting disorder caused by the lack of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application determine whether advate is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, causing blood clots problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but produced according to a method known as "recombinant DNA technology."</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, enabling it to form the human clotting factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advice is similar to another in the European Union called Recombinate, but is otherwise made, so that the medicine does not contain any proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, including a study of 53 children under six years, the use of the drug for the prevention of bleeding as well as in surgical procedures was investigated.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the effectiveness of advocates in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood cells was awarded "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advances (observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advice may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human clotting factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein, or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted the Baxter AG a licence for the placing of lawyers in the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage and duration of substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, the location and extent of the bleeding and the patient's clinical condition.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity in the corresponding period should not fall below the indicated plasma levels (in% of the standard or in I.E. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients less than 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer, until pain and acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients less than 6 years) repeat until the risk for the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment course, appropriate determination of the factor VIII plasma levels is recommended to control the dose and frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can differ in their response to factor VIII, achieve different in vivo recovery and have different half-value times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 Prophylaxis To the long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A, doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight should be given at a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor of VIII plasma activities is not reached or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, a test must be performed to detect an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors, it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The administration speed should depend on the patient's condition whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always opposed to the prokoagulatory activity of factor VIII-directed IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma by modified Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is the greatest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In previously untreated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and an amnestic known inhibitor development, a recombinant Factor VIII product was observed on another, the recurrence of (low-depressive) inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women there are no experiences about the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs in the largest number of patients were inhibitors of factor VIII (5 patients), all of which had previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of forming inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (each 3 patients).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of individual patients (234). the unexpected drop in the blood clotting factor VIII-Spiegels was performed postoperatively (10 - 14 postoperative day) in a patient under continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">The blood clotting was maintained throughout the period and both the Factor VIII- Mirror in the plasma and the Clearance rate showed sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical trials with ADVATE on 145 children and adults 2 with a severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to Factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days) only one patient showed a low inhibitortiter after 26 exposure days with ADVATE (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach).</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, no one of 53 paediatric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed with moderate to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) was diagnosed with a FVIII inhibitor after previous exposure to Factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days).</seg>
<seg id="1562">Previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical trial were 5 out of 25 (20%) treated with ADVATE inhibitors to factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The patient's immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by the antibody titer's examination against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">One patient showed a statistically significant upward trend as well as a sustained peak of the antibody level against anti-CHO cell protein, otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indicative of an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">In four patients the incidence of urticaria, pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophilic granulocytes were reported in several repeated product expositions during the study.</seg>
<seg id="1566">7. as with other IV products ADVATE reports about hypersensitivity reactions of the allergic type, including anaphylactic / anaphylactate reactions (frequency not known).</seg>
<seg id="1567">The activated Factor VIII acts as a factor Factor for the activated Factor IX and accelerates the formation of activated Factor X from Factor X.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All pharmacokinetic studies with ADVATE were performed on pre-treated patients with severe or moderate haemophilia A (basic value of the factor VIII activity ≤ 2%).</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial authorisation, the CHMP has continued to evaluate the benefit-risk assessment as positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP has decided on the basis of ADVATE's safety profile, which necessitates filing of PSURs every 6 months, so that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited announced to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company will withdraw its application for the approval of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni Cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Usually, however, the chest, the brain, the bones or the soft parts (tissue that connects and supports other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"" "the virus in Advexin is an" "" "Adenovirus" "", "which has been modified so that there are no copies of themselves and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans." ""</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin could have been injected directly into the tumors, enabling cancer cells to recreate the normal p53 protein once more.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is formed from the non-defective p53 gene existing in the human body, usually contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">At Li-Fraumeni-Cancer, in which the p53 gene is defective, the p53-protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient who appeared at Li-Fraumeni-Cancer in the area of the underbelly, bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP checked the answers of the company to the questions asked him, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the evaluation of the initial submitted documents, the CHMP creates a list of questions sent to the company by day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP, it was not sufficiently proved that the injection of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni tumors benefits patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns about the processing of the medicine in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company has not sufficiently proved that advexin can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not inform the CHMP about whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or "Combat-Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "changed drug release" "" "means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly over several hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of the seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, an allergy to pollen caused by pollen) in patients with nasal mucosa swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents 12 years of age, the recommended dose of Aerinaze is twice a day a tablet, which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are clogged.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy was the changes in the severity of hay fever symptoms, which were reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hay fever symptoms, besides the constipation of the nose, patients who received aerinaze reported a 46.0% decrease in the symptoms compared to 35.9% in patients taking Pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">When only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients with Aerinaze showed a decrease of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who received desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are tachycardia, dry mouth, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (drowsiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic agents or Loratadin (another medicine used to treat allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze should also not be used in patients who suffer from a congenital glaucoma (elevated intraocular pressure), cardiac or vascular disease including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (cerebral ischemia) or a hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the placing of the Aerinaze on the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but it is whole to swallow (i.e. without disassembling, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy (see Section 5.1), Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms decay.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, since the activity of pseudoephedrine may decrease over time during long-term applications.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory passages, treatment can be continued with desloratadin as monotherapy if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1672">As Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or within 2 weeks after termination of such treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitin, Pergolid, Lisurid, Cabergolin, ergotamine, Dihydrogotamine or other deongestives that are performed in oral or nasal as a drop of Rhinoplasty (phenylpropanol, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, naphazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of Aerinaze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function disorder and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treatment in case of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or amplification of headache) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">In the treatment of the following patient groups, caution is advised: • Patients with cardiac arrhythmia • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in the anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder and bronchospasm in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours before the implementation of dermatological tests, since antihistamines otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce them to their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In clinical trials with desloratadin, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor tests showed no significant differences between the patients treated with loratadin and the patients treated with placebo, regardless of whether they were taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">In-vitro studies, Desloratadin does not inhibit CYP2D6, and in-vitro studies have shown that the CYP2D6 drug is not inhibiting and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the application of Aerinaze during pregnancy is not assured, experience from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, did not increase the frequency of abnormalities as compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies of animals cannot always be transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of Pseudoephedrine, aerosaze should not be applied during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">Patients should, however, be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to a dizziness that may lead to impairment of the perspiration or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible leaking procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headaches, anxiety, aggravating miction, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmia, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, congenital pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, visual disturbances and hypertension or hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is most likely in children, as well as atropine-typical symptoms (dry mouth, pupil rigidity and - dilatation, redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibition of release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / baseophils as well as the inhibiting of the expression of the P-selection on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose trial with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance, including amplification of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg per day.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine at recommended dosage can cause further likeable effects, such as increasing blood pressure, tachycardia or manifestation of CNS excitation.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1,248 patients between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine antagonistic efficacy of Aerinaze tablets, determined based on the overall scores for symptoms (except for nasal mucosa swelling), was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of Aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucosa swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of age, age or ethnicity.</seg>
<seg id="1697">In a single dose trial on the pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, Desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes after the plasma is administered.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of Aerinaze in healthy volunteers over 14 days, the flow equation of loratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the context of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose trial, which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects of desloratadin were poorly metabolised.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (CMAx and AUC) from pseudoephedrine after the exclusive application of Pseudoephedrine is bioequivalent after exposure to an aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">However, based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated application, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with desloratadin cannot be identified with particular risks to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies, the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg per day and on rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">In March 2007 and in module 1.8.1 of the application application, the pharmacovigilance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to alleviating the allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's own substance that can unfold its effect.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the market launch of Desloratadin very rarely has been reported cases of severe allergic reactions (shortness of breath, whistling breathing, itching, hives and swelling) or skin rash.</seg>
<seg id="1718">Cases of palpitations, heart chase, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, drowsiness, sleep disturbances, muscle pain, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, cases of inflammation of the liver and cases of conspicuous liver prominence has also been reported very rarely.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as a 5 mg tablet, 5 mg / lyophilisate for taking (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg / ml syrup (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children at the age of one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once daily, in the form of 2.5 ml syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children between 6 and 11 years, the dose is 2.5 mg once daily, either in 5 ml syrup or 5 ml syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in a total of eight studies involving approximately 4,800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four trials for seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies of patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadrcles, impaired sleep, and performance on the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted to verify that the body uses the syrup, the solution for taking and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, if the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius resulted in an average decrease of the symptom scores (symptom score) by 25 to 32%, compared to the reduction of 12 to 26% in the patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies at Urticaria, the decrease in the symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% compared to 40 and 33% in the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to loratadin, lauatadin or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the placing of Aerius across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once daily, with one or without a meal, for alleviating symptoms in allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience in clinical trials for efficacy in the use of desloratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be performed according to the previous disease process and can be terminated following the decay of the symptoms and resumed during reoccurring.</seg>
<seg id="1732">Allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks) can be recommended to patients during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions have not been found in clinical trials with Desloratadin tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally given (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, alcohol does not increase the performance-reducing effect of alcohol while taking Aerius and alcohol (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">Patients should, however, be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to dizziness, which may lead to impairment of the perspiration or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo was tiredness (1,2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">A clinical trial involving 578 adolescent patients from 12 to 17 years was the most common side effect of headaches. this occurred in 5.9% of patients treated with desloratadin and 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose trial administered up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine times clinical dosage).</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibition of release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / baseophils as well as inhibiting the expression of the P-selection of the P-seltin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">As part of a clinical study with multiple doses given to desloratadin in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical-pharmacological study, in which a dose of 45 mg. a day (nine times the clinical dose) was administered over ten days, no prolongation of the Qtc interval proved.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose trial with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance, including amplification of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in relieving symptoms such as sneezing, nose-secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tears of tear and reddening of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis may also be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis depending on the duration of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persisting allergic rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown by the overall scores of the questionnaire on quality of life of Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria has been investigated as representative for further forms of urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology, regardless of aetiology, is similar in the different forms, and chronic patients can be recruited more easily.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since histamination is a causative factor in all causal diseases, it is expected that in other forms of urticaria, Desloratadin will also lead to an improvement in the symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and reducing the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in the case of chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who did not react to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improvement of the itch by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desloratadin compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius significantly reduced the disturbance of sleep and wakefulness, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, in which patient-demos were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients achieved a higher concentration of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications for clinically relevant cumulation after a daily application of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not entirely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1758">In-vivo, Desloratadin does not inhibit CYP2D6 and in-vitro studies have shown that the CYP2D6 drug is not inhibiting and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose trial with desloratadin in a dosage of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, low-calorie breakfast) did not affect the availability of loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies performed with loratadin and Loratadin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxicity profile of Desloratadin and Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated application, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with Desloratadin do not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of meals, for alleviating symptoms in allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see Section 4.4) and that there is no data available to support a treatment of an infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>

<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabolise desloratadin and experience higher substance strain (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius Sirup in children between the ages of 2 and 11, which is metabolized, is identical to that of children that metabolize normally.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medication contains sucrose and sorbitol, so patients with hereditary problems should not take this medicine with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose absorption or sucrose insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions have not been found in clinical studies with Aerius tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally given (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical-pharmacological study, the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius tablets and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius Sirup group as in the placebo group.</seg>

<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and reducing the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this restricted metallizing phenotype was comparable to adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations greater in blacks (18% adults, 16% children) than with Caucasians (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multidose trial with the syrup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis which are metabolized.</seg>

<seg id="1893">In June 2008, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. has officially announced that the company rejects its application for the authorisation of Aflunov for the prevention of aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that is intended to protect from a strain of influenza virus that could cause future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new trunk of the flu virus appears, which can easily spread from man to man, because people have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognises the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as "alien" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system will later be able to develop antibodies quickly in a contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane cover of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which the human body recognizes as a body alien), was purified and used as a constituent of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"" "a survey of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with" "" "good clinical practice" "" "(GCP)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the amount of clinical data base for assessing the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for pre-pandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Should you take part in a clinical trial and require further information on your treatment, please contact your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">For further information on the basis of CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years, which are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who do not swallow the capsules, Agenera is available as a solution to take in, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir since the safety of this combination has not been investigated.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It should only be administered if the doctor has checked which antiviral medicines the patient has previously taken and the likelihood of the virus being addressed to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of ritonavir and other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Aboomerase after body weight is directed.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other antiviral medicines, Aregeneration reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Not to cure AIDS, however, can delay damage to the immune system and thereby also the development of AIDS-related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">This medicine, which was enhanced with low-dose Ritonavir, was compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who had previously taken protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the viral load change after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously had no proteasase inhibitors, after 48 weeks in Agenera more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml than placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenera also reduced the viral load, but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with proteasase inhibitors were very few.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with proteasase inhibitors, this medicine led by Ritonavir strengthened the viral load after 16-week treatment as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, it came under Agenera together with Ritonavir to increase the viral load after four weeks than with the patients who continued to take their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) include headaches, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Arecase should not be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amprenavir or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase may not be used in patients, the St. John's wort (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or medicinal products, which are broken down as well as agglomerate and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, there is the risk of a lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of the body fat), osteoarthritis (death of bone tissue) or an immune reactivation syndrome (symptoms of an infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee on Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Agenase in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1-infected adults and children treated with protease inhibitors outweigh the risks for over four years.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee found that the benefit of amnase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who had previously taken no protease inhibitors is not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally licensed under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "as limited information was available at the time of authorisation for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the Glaxo Group Limited authorisation for the transport of nuclear gases across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenase is in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, proteasinhibitors (PI) -treated adults and children aged 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually, asgeneric capsules are to be administered to pharmacokinetic boosters of amprenavir along with low doses of ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amprenavir should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pretreatment of the patient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amprenavir as a solution for taking up is 14% less than amprenavir as a capsule; hence, Agenerase capsules and solution for taking on a milligram per milligram basis are not interchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg amprenavir twice daily along with 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenase capsules are applied without the reinforcing addition of ritonavir (booster), higher doses of Aregeneration (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules amounts to 20 mg of amprenavir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of asgeneric ase in combination with low doses of ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not investigated in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age, due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The concurrent application should be taken care of in patients with mild or moderate liver function disorder, in patients with severe liver function disorder, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">It should not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also present substrates of the cytochrome P450 Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be applied because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a diminished therapeutic effect of Amprenavir while taking Amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that astral or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy, including treatment with Aregeneration, does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, Agrase capsules are to be used together with low doses of ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of a simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please refer to the specific information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing reduced liver function, including chronic-active hepatitis, show increased frequency of hepatic dysfunctions under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Aperase and Ritonavir with Fluticasone or other glucocorticoids, which are metabolised via CYP3A4, is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroidal effects including Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal kidney function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of astral with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended due to the increased risk of myopathies including habdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines which may cause serious or life threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under the supervision of the International standard ised ratio), methods for determining drug concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients taking these drugs at the same time, Aregeneration may be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Because of the possibility of metabolic interactions with amprenavir, the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given with amprenavir at the same time, patients should be monitored for withdrawal symptoms, especially if low doses of ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the potential risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycolide content of the Agenerase solution, this dosage form is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with care in certain other patient populations.</seg>
<seg id="1952">A rash should be set for 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors were reported to have diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases requiring medication to be associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and associated with drug-dependent factors, such as prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In heinophilous patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneously cutaneous hematomas and haemarthrosis occur.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can develop at the time of initiating an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), leading to severe clinical conditions or worsening symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although multifactorial etiology is adopted (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteoarthritis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width are not allowed to be given at the same time as medicines with a low therapeutic width and also present substrates of the cytochrome P450 Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with ritonavir must not be given together with medicines whose active substances are metabolised mainly via CYP2D6 and are associated with severe and / or life-threatening side effects for the elevated plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of Amprenavir leading to virological failure and resistance to resistance.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to compensate the lower plasma levels by supplementing other protease inhibitors in combination with ritonavir, adverse effects on the liver were observed very frequently.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of amprenavir can be reduced by the simultaneous use of plant preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient has already taken St. John's wort, the Amprenavirus mirrors and, if possible, to check the viral load and remove the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not required if Nelfinavir is administered together with Amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased, by contrast, reduced by 30% for CMAx when ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Amprenavir Capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg amprenavir were used twice daily and ritonavir 100 mg twice daily demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower if amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Caletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of amprenavir in plasma, which were obtained twice daily in the combination of amprenavir (600 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg of ritonavir is administered twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of amprenavir and caletra cannot be given, but a close-meshed surveillance is recommended, as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study carried out in combination with didansis in combination with didanosine, but due to the antasis component of Didanosin it is recommended that the revenues of Didanosin and Agenerase differ at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), no dose adjustment is required in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with Amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended, as exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of nevirapin on other proteasinhibitors and existing limited data suggests that nevirapin may precipitate the serum concentration of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used at the same time, caution is advised as Delaviron could be less effective because of the decreased or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">Careful clinical and virological monitoring should be performed, as an exact prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of amprenavir and rifabutin resulted in an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) by Rifabutin by 193% and thus an increase in side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin along with Agenerase, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dosage, although there is no clinical data available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with Agenase in combination with erythromycin were not performed, however, the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg Fosamprenavir and 100 mg of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and AUC (0-τ) increased to 2.69x compared to the value observed after 200 mg of ketoconazole once daily without concurrent application of Fosamprenavir with ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, may lead to interactions if they are used together with a generic nose.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicines, if they are used in combination with asperase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors, it is advised that Antazida is not taken at the same time as atherosclerosis since it can result in resorption problems.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anticonvulants known as enzyme adductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amprenavir may result in degradation of the plasma levels of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipin, diltiazem, felodipine, nimodipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, nipampin, nifedipine, nimodipine, nipampin, nifedipine, nimodipine, nipampin, nifedipine, nimodipine, nipampin, nifedipine, nimodipine, nipampin, nifedipine, nimodipine, nipampin, nifedipine, nimodipine, nipampin, nifedipine, nimodipine, nipampin, nifedipine, nimodipine, nipampin, nifedipine, nimodipine, nipampin, nifedipine, nimodipine, nipampin, nifedipine, nimodipine, nipampin, nifedipine, nimodipine, nipampin, nifedipine, nimodipine, nipampin, nifedipine, ni</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous intake of Agenerase can greatly increase their plasma concentrations and increase the side effects associated with PDE5 inhibitors including hypotension, vision disturbances and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times per day) more than 7 days on subjects, the endogenous cortisol decreased by approximately 86% (90% -confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous administration of amperase with ritonavir along with these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroidal effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">With HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, pronounced increases in plasma levels can be expected concurrently with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma-level increases of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy, including a habdomyolysis, the combined use of these drugs with Amprenavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">More frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabilization of the mirror is recommended, as the plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased with the same dose of amprenavir (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase should not be used together with oral midazolam (see section 4.3), while with simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam, caution is advised.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of Midazolam around 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with Amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored for withdrawal symptoms, especially if low doses of ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the very low reliability of historical comparisons, there is currently no recommendation to adjust the amprenavirus dose if amprenavir is given at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With simultaneous dispensing of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with atherosclerosis, increased control of the INR (International Regular Ratio) is recommended due to the possibility of weakening or amplification of the anti-thrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of additional administration of ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, therefore alternative methods for contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example, Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended at the same time as Arecase (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this drug may be used only after careful weighing of the possible benefit for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">Amprenavir-related substances have been proven in the milk of lactation rats, but it is not known whether Amprenavir is transferred to breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, which was administered by the implantation in the uterus up to the end of the lactation period, showed a diminished increase in the 12 body weight during the lactation period.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of descendants, including fertility and reproductive capacity, was not affected by the administration of Amprenavir to the mother-animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of Agenase was investigated in adults and in children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the Agenerase treatment were mild to moderate, early on and rarely resulted in the treatment of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events, it is not clear whether they are in connection with the intake of Agenase or another at the same time as HIV treatment, or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients with proteasase inhibitors not received 200 mg of Aregeneration twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4) evaluated by investigators as related to the study medication and performed in more than 1% of patients, as well as in the treatment of occurring laboratory changes (Grade 3 to 4).</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with redistribution of the body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and multiple subcutaneous fatty tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophy of breasts and dorsocerebral fat accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretroviral non pretreated individuals who had been treated with amprenavir in combination with lamivudine / zidovudine for a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case (stitches) (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006, in 245 NRTI- pretreated patients treated with Amprenavir 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients under Indinavir, in combination with various NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rashes were usually moderate to moderate, erythematous or makulophic nature, with or without itching and occurred usually during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with amprenavir had to be broken off.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Osteoarthritis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can develop at the time of initiating an antiretroviral combination therapy (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI treated patients who received 600 mg of Aregeneration twice daily with low-dose Ritonavir (Grade 3 and 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4), which were observed under any amusing treatment, were very common in patients who received Agenerase along with low-dose Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of an overdose, the patient must observe signs of an intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, to initiate necessary support measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active center of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents viral Gag- and gag-pol- polylog-precursors by forming unripe, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro to HIV-1 IIIB was investigated in both acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% hemmconcentration (IC50) of Amprenavir is in the range from 0,012 to 0.08 µM in acute infected cells and is 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of amprenavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral non-treated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosage, as in other Ritonavir treatment schemas with protease inhibitors - the mutations described are rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral patients who received 100mg of Fosamprenavir with 100mg of ritonavir twice daily in the ESS100732 trial, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, with 14 isolates being genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypic analysis of 13 out of 14 children, where a virological failure occurred within the 59 enrolled patients with protease inhibitors, showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, M36I, I62V, I54L / M / T / V, A71V, V77I, V82A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 and its extension APV30005 (700 mg Fosamprenavir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice a day: n = 107) with protease inhibitors occurred in patients with virological failure over 96 weeks, the following protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypic resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, I62V, V82A / C / S / T / V, I84V and L90M in conjunction with an increased phenotypic resistance to Fosamprenavir with ritonavir and a reduced likelihood of virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Phenotypic resistance tests based on phenotypic resistance tests can be used in conjunction with genotypic data for estimating the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that market diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically-phenotypic cut-offs (separation points) for FPV / RTV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Amprenavir associated genetic patterns produces a certain cross resistance against ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir, and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on cross resistance between Amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral non-pretreated patients, in which a resistance against Lopinavir and saquinavir (one of 25 isolates), indinavir / Ritonavir (one of 25 isolates), indinavir / Ritonavir (three out of 24 isolates), and zoquinavir / Ritonavir (four out of 24 isolates) can be called forth.</seg>
<seg id="2033">Conversely, Amprenavir retains its activity against some other protease inhibitors resistant isolates; maintaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early termination of a failing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations in limits, which can affect the subsequent treatment adversely.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The testament to the efficacy of Agenase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study, in which PI treated adults after virological failure (100 mg twice daily) and nucleoosidanaloga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, mainly with low-dose Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred threescore and sixty (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the A of PRO30017 Study.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis demonstrated the non-inferiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group in the viral load (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, in a non-capillary threshold of 0.4 logical copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The proof of the efficacy of unbanned aspiration is based on two uncontrolled trials involving 288 HIV-infected children at the age of 2 to 18 years, of which 152 had been pre-treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase solution was used for intake and capsules in dosages of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low dose detonavir was given at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, about 25% of the patients enrolled in the study had a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) versus the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "19 Based on this data, the expected benefits of" "" "unoostertem" "" "astrecase should be considered in the therapy optimisation with PI treated children." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the average duration (tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of Amprenavir is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased, by contrast, reduced by 30% for CMAx when ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Amprenavir 12 hours after dose (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore the minimum concentration in the steady state (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by the intake of food, although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an unhindered penetration of amprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, whereby the amount of uncommon amprenavir, which represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active component varies depending on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the range of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 must be administered with caution when given with caution when given at the same time (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to a similar daily amprenavir exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">As a solution, Amprenavir is 14% less bioavailable than the capsules; therefore, Agenerase solution and Agenerase capsules are not exchangeable on a milligram basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also, the renal Clearance of Ritonavir is negligible, therefore the effect of a kidney function disorder should be limited to the elimination of amprenavir and ritonavir.</seg>

<seg id="2209">Animal studies show no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / embryonic development, obstruction or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although the serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) can be achieved neither after a one-time nor after several topical application, no recommendation can be given during the lactation period.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most common adverse events related to the application of imiquimod cream related side effects in the studies with three weeks of treatment were local reactions in the place of treating the tilt warts (33.7% of patients treated with imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2212">Among the most commonly reported and likely or possibly with the application of the imiquimod cream related side effects include discomfort in the application location with an incidence of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The reported adverse events reported by 185 with imiquimod-cream from a placebo-controlled clinical trial of Phase III clinical trials are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common, most likely or possibly with the application of the imiquimod cream in the related side effect were a reaction to the application location in these studies (22% of patients treated with imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The side effects specified by 252 in placebo-controlled clinical trials of phase III with imiquimodine-cream patients with actinic keratose are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The evaluation of clinical signs planned according to the test plan shows that placebo-controlled clinical trials with imiquimod cream are often associated with local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), eccitation / aborting (23%) and edema (14%) (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">The evaluation of clinical signs planned according to the test plan shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with imiquimod cream, severe erythrocytes (31%), severe erosion (13%), and severe deformation and calming (19%) occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials evaluating the use of Imiquimod for the treatment of acute keratosis, alopecia was observed with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The inadvertent orale intake of 200 mg of imiquimod, equivalent to the content of about 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically serious side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, consisted of hypotonia, which normalized after orally or intravenous fluids.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic investigation, systemic concentrations of alpha interferon and other cytokines were detected after the topical application of imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal Phase 3 efficacy studies it was possible to show that the efficacy in relation to a complete healing of the tilt warts in an imiquimodine treatment over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment was clearly superior.</seg>
<seg id="2223">At 60% of patients who had exhausted all of the 119 patients who had exhausted all other forms of therapy, this was the case with 20% of the 105 patients who had exhausted all other forms of therapy (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 patients treated with Imiquimod, compared to 5% of 161-treated male patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of Imiquimod in five times a week over 6 weeks was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary superficielle basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">Data from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years showed that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all patients treated clinically cured and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of Imiquimod during three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week treatment-free period, was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, nonhyperkeratotic lesions within a contiguous 25 cm2 treatment area on the unhairy scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The two-year data from two combined observational studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">In paediatric patients, paediatric patients usually do not appear in paediatric patients and are therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Cream has been studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials of children between 2 and 15 years with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies in the doses investigated there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks / week).</seg>
<seg id="2234">Minimal systemic absorption of the 5% Imiquimod cream by the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratosis was observed during the three-week application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drug concentrations in the serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and were 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 mg / ml in the application in the face (12.5 mg, 1 single bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated obvious half-life time was about 10 times higher than the 2-hour half-life after the subcutaneous application in an earlier study; this indicates prolonged retention of the medicine in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data for systemic exposure showed that the resorption of Imiquimod after topical application on MC-diseased skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years was low and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with actinic keratose or superficient basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study on the dermal toxicity of the rat, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of CG led to significantly lowered body weight and increased spleen weight; a study carried out for four months for the dermal application showed no similar effects for the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice at the maler administration on three days a week did not induce tumours in the application.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The appropriate mechanism is not known, but since imiquimod is only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagenic, there is a risk to humans due to systemic exposure to be very low.</seg>
<seg id="2241">Tumors entered the group of mice treated with the substance-free cream earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2254">If you have intercourse while infection with tilt warts in the genital area, the treatment with Aldara cream after sexual intercourse (not before) is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have other medicines or have recently used it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2256">Do not breastfeed your baby during treatment with Aldara cream, as it is not known whether Imiquimod is transferred to breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2257">The frequency and duration of the treatment are different in case of tilt warts, basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratosis (see specific instructions for each application area).</seg>
<seg id="2258">Apply a thin layer of Aldara cream to the clean, dry skin place with the tilt warts and rub the cream gently on the skin until the cream is fully absorbed.</seg>
<seg id="2259">Men with cowwarts under the foreskin need to withdraw the foreskin every day and wash the skin area beneath it (see section 2 "What do you have to consider before applying Aldara cream?").</seg>
<seg id="2260">Please talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have the impression that the effect of Aldara is too strong or too weak.</seg>
<seg id="2261">Apply a sufficient amount of Aldara cream for 6 weeks in a row to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area.</seg>

<seg id="2265">A reduced number of blood cells may make you more susceptible to infections; it can cause a blue stain to occur in you or it can cause dullness.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Tell your doctor or pharmacist if any of the side effects listed you significantly affects or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information.</seg>
<seg id="2267">In addition, you can feel itching (32% of patients), burn (26% of patients) or pain in the areas you applied to Aldara cream (8% of patients).</seg>
<seg id="2268">Usually these are lighter skin reactions, which finish off again within approximately 2 weeks after the treatment is stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2269">Occasionally some patients notice changes in the application location (wound secretion, inflammation, swelling, worsening, dermatitis) or irritability, nausea, dry mouth, flu-like symptoms and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2270">Occasionally some patients suffer from changes in the application location (bleeding, inflammation, wound secretion, ulceration, blackness or discomfort), inflammation of the nasal mucosa, clogged nose, flu or flu-like symptoms, depression, irritation, swelling of the eyelids, redness, facial swelling, ulcers, aching limbs, fever, weakness or chills.</seg>
<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzyme therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (the symptoms that do not relate to brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not degraded, thus accumulating in most organs in the body and damaging them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: increased liver, stiff joints, complicating movements, decreased lung volume, heart and eye disease.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should take place in a hospital or clinic with rebelting equipment, and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to the administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study mainly the safety of the drug was examined, but its effectiveness was also measured (by examining its effect in terms of reducing GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under the age of five, Aldurazyme lowered the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Alduraziyme in patients at the age of over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in limbs (in hands and feet), heat, fever and reactions to the infusion site.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients less than five years are elevated blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measurement of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review all new information that may be disclosed each year and, where necessary, update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">Aldurazyme is known to be patients who receive aldurazyme in response to the reactions to infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted Genzyme Europe B.V. permission for the transport of Aldurazyme across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammalian cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, ovarian of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient tolerates this, every 15 minutes in single steps can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyme in patients with renal or liver failure was not determined and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Alduraziyme can develop infusion-related reactions defined as any side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be carried out in an adequate clinical setting where recovery facilities for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical Phase 3 study, it is expected that nearly all IgG antibodies are immune to laronidase, usually within 3 months from the start of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when using aldurazyme (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience concerning the resumption of the treatment after a longer break, due to the theoretically increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions following an interruption of the treatment must be treated cautiously.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of infusion with medications (antihistamines and / or antipyretiants) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In the case of a mild or moderate infusion-related reaction, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be weighed and / or a reduction of infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the case of a single, severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 are (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) and a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the preceding reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used at the same time with Chloroquin or Procaine, because there is a potential risk of interference with the intracellular absorption of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal studies do not cause direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">As there is no data for newborns exposed to breast milk compared to laronidase, it is recommended to do not breast-feed during treatment with aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were primarily treated as infusion-related reactions which were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (duration of treatment up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants less than 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were observed during the phase III study and their prolongation in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older during a treatment duration of up to 4 years, are listed in the following table according to the following Frequencies: very common (≥ 1 / 10); common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-associated involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the prehistory, severe reactions also occurred, including bronchospasm, respiration and facial oils (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted drug interactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were reported in a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 years, with predominantly severe follow-up and a treatment duration up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most patients were treated with a serum version within 3 months of the treatment, with a severe follow-up usually within one month at the age of 5 (average after 26 days versus 45 days for patients at the age of 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the Phase 3 study (or until premature ejection from the study), no antibodies were present in 13 / 45 patients (RIP) assay, including 3 patients with whom there was never a serum version.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with a lack of low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the GAG level in the urine, while a variable reduction of GAG in the urine was found in patients with high antibody titers.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study) showed a marginal or low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic Laronidase activity in vitro, which seemed to impair clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not seem to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions, although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The rationale for the enzyme therapy is based in one of the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrats and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from the circulation and is absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, most likely via manose-6 phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were studied in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, which showed the entire spectrum of the disease, the majority of patients from the middle phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute auditor.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open-label extension study, where they received a further 3.5 years (182 weeks) each week 100 E / kg Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with aldurazyme showed an improvement in lung function and hearing, which is presented in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as mentioned in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FEV is not clinically significant over this period and the total lung volume increases in proportion to the size of the children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with Hepatomegaly before treatment, 22 (85%) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease in the GAG mirror was found in the urine (µg / mg of creatinine), which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In terms of the heterogeneous disease manifestation between patients taking into account clinically significant changes across five active efficacy variables (expected percentage of normal FEV, distance in the 6-minute auditory, range of movement of shoulder joint AHI), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a worsening of 9 patients (20%) were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was conducted, in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were studied in 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion (16 patients with severe traverse shape and 4 with the mean follow-up form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased Gag- levels in the urine in week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size increase (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) found a normal mental development speed for this age group The younger patients with the severe follow-up form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed a normal mental development speed, whereas in the older patients with severe follow-up only limited or no progress was observed in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, tests on pharmacodynamic effects of various aldurazyme dosage schemes were performed on the GAG mirror in the urine, the liver volume and the 6-minute auditing test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks may represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulty with weekly injections; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the features of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Pharmacokinetic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to those in older and less severely affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity with unique gift, toxicity in repeated dose and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data do not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood-image changes or in which certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed, stopped or the dose should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of Pemetrexed thus slows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The conversion of Pemetrexed to its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer life time in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of malignant pleuramesothelioma, Alimta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease, previously treated with chemotherapy, were compared with the effects of docetaxel (another medicine against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (another medicine against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and cisplatin had an average of 12.1 months compared to 9.3 months at the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the mean survival time with Alimta was 8.3 months, compared to 7.9 months for docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients with cancer did not attack the epithelial cells during the administration of Alimta for longer survival compared to the comparative medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. a permit for the transport of Alimta in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each pass-through bottle must be dissolved with a 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary dose is taken from the water bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is indicated in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer except for overwhelmingly plate epithelial histology (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for the treatment in second-line treatment of patients with localized or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer except for overwhelmingly plate epithelial histology (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² of body surface (KOF) is administered as intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as an infusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after the Pemetrexed- Infusion on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered as intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment course.</seg>
<seg id="2375">In order to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid should be given the day before and on the day of the Pemetrexed Gift and on the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of Pemetrexed, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last Pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients must also receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week before the first Pemetrexed dose as well as after each third treatment course.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving Pemetrexed, a complete blood picture should be created before each application, including a differentiation of the leukocytes and a thrombocyte count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine-transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose examination must take place taking into account the Nadirs of the blood picture or the maximal non-haematological toxicity of the predictive treatment cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are suitable for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients develop non-haematological toxicity ≥ degree 3 (except neurotoxicity), treatment with ALIMTA must be interrupted until the patient has the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be aborted if a hematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity level 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 dose-reductis or as a result of the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that there is an increased risk of side effects in patients at the age of 65 or above, compared to patients at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, no dose adaptations were necessary in patients with a Creatinin Clearance ≥ 45 ml / min which go beyond the recommended dose adaptations for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a Creatinin Clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5-fold of the upper Bilirubin- Border and / or Transaminase values of &gt; the 3,0-fold of the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0-times the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) were not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with respect to bone marinosuppression and Pemetrexed may not be administered to patients before their absolute neutrophal count returns a value ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ and the platelet cyte number once more a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrophils, thrombocyte number and maximum non-haematological toxicity observed in the preceding treatment cycles (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 haematological and noncorrosive toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neutropenia was observed when a pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetrexed must be instructed to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid simultaneous intake of nonsteroidal antiphlogistika (NSAIDs) for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients with Pemetrexed should avoid taking NSAIDs with a long half-life for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in which these events occurred had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, preexisting hypertension or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">For this reason, clinically significant fluid accumulation in the transcellular space should be considered to be drainage of the effusion prior to Pemetrexed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 Cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with Pemetrexed if this drug was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic compound.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous use of attenuated life vaccines (excluding yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of irreversible grading of the reproductive capacity is due to Pemetrexed, men should be advised in front of the treatment chin to obtain advice regarding the sperm conservation.</seg>
<seg id="2401">High doses of nonsteroidal antiphlogistian (NSAIDs, such as Ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage (≥ 3 g daily) can result in reduced pemeal deposition in patients with normal kidney function (≥ 3 g daily).</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore, caution is required if high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid can be applied in high doses for patients with normal kidney function (Creatinine Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy, the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetrexed are avoided (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there is no data regarding the interaction potential with NSAIDs with a long half-life time such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, simultaneous use with Pemetrexed must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetre- mixed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The great intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of INR (International Norised Ratio) when the decision was made to treat patients with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There is no data for the use of Pemetrexed in pregnant women, but as with antimetabolites severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed may not be used during pregnancy unless absolutely challenging, and after careful weighing of the benefits for the mother and the risk of foetus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible damage of reproductive capacity is due to Pemetrexed, men should be advised before the start of treatment to obtain advice regarding the blocking of the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether Pemetrexed exceeds mother's milk and unwanted effects on breast-fed infants cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the incidence and severity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma, randomized cisplatin and Pemetrexed and 163 patients with mesothelioma who were randomised to receive cisplatin as monotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="2430">Cases of radiotherapy were reported in patients treated before, during or after their Pemetrexed therapy (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetrexed) is an antineoplastic antifolate, which exercises its effect by interrupting important follic acid-dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that Pemetrexed acts as an anti-folate with several points of attack by blocking the thymidylynthase (TS), Dihydrological-reductase (DHFR) and glycinamidribonucleotidfor- myltransferase (GARFT), the key-dependent key enzymes of the de novo biosynthesis of thymid- and Purinnucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicentre, randomised, single-blind phase 3 study of ALIMTA plus cisplatin in chemonically treated patients with malignant pleural amesothelioma showed that patients with ALIMTA and Cisplatin had a clinically meaningful benefit to those patients who were only treated with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the investigational medication (randomized and treated) in the treatment arm.</seg>
<seg id="2435">A statistically significant improvement in clinically relevant symptoms (pain and dyspnea) in connection with the malignant pleuramesothelioma was shown in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm (212 patients) in comparison with the only Cispla- tin arm (218 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2436">The differences between the two arms were improved by improving lung function parameters in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm and worsening lung function over time in the control arm.</seg>
<seg id="2437">A multi-center, randomised, open phase III trial with ALIMTA against docetaxel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC showed a median survival time of 8.3 months in patients treated with ALIMTA (Intent to treat population n = 283) and from 7.9 months in patients treated with docetaxel (ITT n = 288).</seg>

<seg id="2504">Patients who take Alli and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2505">If these enzymes are inhibited, they cannot break down some fats in the food, thereby causing a quarter of the fats to be covered with the food undigested the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In a third study, Alli was compared with 391 overweight patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In both studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who received Alli 60 mg received an average weight loss of 4.8 kg after one year, compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">In the study with Alli in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2, no weight loss could be observed for patients.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of Alli (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are oily patches on after, flatus (winch) with stucco, stun rope, oily / oily chair, oily secretion (feces), flatulence (winch) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It should not be used in patients treated with Ciclosporin (to prevent organ rejection in graft patients) or with medicines such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="2511">It must also not be applied to patients suffering from a long-term malabsorption syndrome (in which not enough nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract) or in cholestase (liver disease), and in pregnant women or breastfeeding mothers.</seg>
<seg id="2512">In July 2007, the European Commission granted the Glaxo Group Limited authorisation for placing Orlistat GSK in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight (Body Mass Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in combination with a slightly hypocaloric, low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli must not be used by children and adolescents under 18, since there is not enough data on efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">However, since orlistat is only temporarily resorbed, no adjustment of dosage is necessary in older and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">• hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the other components • Simultaneous treatment with Ciclosporin (see Section 4.6) • Chronic malabsorption syndrome • Premature treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see Sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) may increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich meal or fat-rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since weight reduction in diabetes can go hand in hand with improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult with alli a doctor or pharmacist before starting a therapy because the dosage of the antidiabetic must be adapted if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who take alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage of these drugs needs to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional pregnancy-related measures in order to prevent possible failure of oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">Both in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous use of orlistat and Ciclosporin, a lowering of the Ciclosporin plasma levels was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">When applying Warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick-Values (internationally regular-ised ratio, INR) could be influenced (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years, concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K and beta carotene remained in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take a complementary multivitamin supplement before bedtime to ensure sufficient vitamin intake (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the application of a one-time dose of Amiodarone, a marginal decrease in the amodarone plasma concentration was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are associated with the pharmacological effect of the drug, as the absorption of recorded fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal adverse events were obtained from clinical studies with orlistat 60 mg for a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data is not predictable).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The incidence of known adverse events reported after the market launch of orlistat is not known, as these events have been reported voluntarily by a population of unknown magnitude.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treatment with alli can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg of orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and obese patients over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases reported after the market launch of orlistat overdosing either side effects or similar side effects as reported at the recommended dose of orlistat were reported.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on investigations on humans and animals, a rapid recovery of any systemic effects caused by the lipid-inhibiting properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect is achieved in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestines by covalent bonding to the active serin-remainder of the gastric and pankreatic leases.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical trials have been derived that 60 mg of orlistat, taken three times a day, blocks the absorption of approximately 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo controlled trials in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 determine the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypocaloric, low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight versus the initial value (at the time of randomization), was evaluated as follows: as a change in body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as part of those study participants who lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although weight reduction was observed for more than 12 months in both studies, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The mean change in the Gesamtcholesterin was 60 mg -2.4% with orlistat -2.4% (baseline value 5,20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (baseline value 5,26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The mean change in LDL cholesterol was 60 mg -3.5% with orlistat (baseline 3.30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (baseline value 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At waist circumference, the average change was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (initial value 103.7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (baseline value 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg of orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 in general, in therapeutic doses, not metabolized orlistat in the plasma could only be demonstrated sporadically and at extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">Two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysated Lactonring) and M3 (M1 after splitting the N-form yl leucine group), were identified, representing approximately 42% of total plasma concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemotherapies which are strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (like cisplatin), as well as in chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The efficacy of aloxi can be increased by adding a Corticosteroids (a medicine that can be used as an antiemetic drug).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use of patients under the age of 18 is not recommended since there is not enough information on the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient inhibits the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to receptors in the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2612">In three main studies Aloxi was studied in 1 842 adults who received chemotherapies, which are strong and moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, which are strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with alogues showed no vomiting in 24 hours of chemotherapy (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with alogues showed no vomiting in 24 hours of chemotherapy (153 from 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted Denn Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd., a licence for the marketing of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated: to prevent acute nausea and vomiting in highly emetogenic chemotherapy as a result of cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in excessively emetogenic chemotherapy as a result of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of alopxi for prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by a highly emetogenic chemotherapy may be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given before chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can extend the colon massage, patients with amnestial obstruction or signs of a subacute ion should be closely monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is required with simultaneous dispensing of Palonosetron with medicines which extend the QT interval or in patients where the Qt interval is extended or which tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, Alois is not to be used either for prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron did not inhibit the activity of the five examined chemotherapeutic agents (Cisplatin, Cyclophosphamide, Cycloabin, doxorubicin, and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a steady State- concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, it was shown that the simultaneous application of CYP2D6 inductors (dexamethasone and rifampicin) and CYP2D6 inhibitors (amoxetine, doxorubicine, fluoxetine, ranitidine, kritonavir, sertraline and terbinafin) had no significant effect on the clearing of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience for the application of Palonosetron in human pregnancies is not present, so Palonosetron should not be used for pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the treating physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common adverse events were observed at a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients), which could at least be related to alogues, headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the date of performance (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post marketing reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">There were similar frequencies of adverse events in the group with the highest dosage as in other dosage groups; there were no dose-effect relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies have been performed. however, due to the large distribution volume, dialysis is probably not an effective therapy for alchemy overdosing.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients who received a excessively emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and 250 micrograms or 750 micrograms of palonosetron were compared to patients who received 32 mg Ondansetron (half-life of 7.3 hours) that was given intravenously on day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomized double-blind study, a total of 667 patients receiving a highly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2Cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of palonosetron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg of ondansetron, which were given intravenously on day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the study with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study with strong emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials on the indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters, including the Qtc interval, were comparable to the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular failure and repolarization and to extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy volunteers was to evaluate the ECG-effects of palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Following IV administration, initial acceptance of plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination from the body with an average terminale half-life of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the area below the concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are usually dose-proportional in the entire dose range of 0.390 μ and / kg for healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous administration of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase in the plasma concentration of 11 testicular cancer patients was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations show that at once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg of palonosetron was comparable to 3 consecutive days (AUC0- ∞) with the value measured after one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg; however, the CMAx was higher after the single-recurrence of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and about another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites which, compared to Palonosetron, have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies of metabolisation have shown that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, the Isoenzyme CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After having an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine, palonosetron as unaltered agent made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time intravenous bolus injection, total body exposure was 173 ± 73 ml / min and renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In patients with severe liver dysfunction, the terminale eliminatory cure time and the average systemic exposure with palonosetron are increased, however, a reduction in the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies, effects were observed only after exposures that are considered adequate for the maximum humanistic exposure, suggesting a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of preclinical studies evidence indicates that Palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and can extend the length of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose corresponded roughly the 30x of the therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given daily for two years, resulted in an increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal marrow) and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and since Alois is determined in humans for one-time application, the relevance of these results is regarded as low for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a negative report, in which the rejection of approval for the placing of the medicines intended for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheum should resemble a biologic drug called Roferon-A with the same medicinal product that is already approved in the EU (also called "reference medicaments").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease called by a viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic investigation, the liver tissue damages the liver tissue, and the values of the liver enzyme alanine amino-ferase (ALT) are abnormal in the blood abnormal.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was brought in to stimulate the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Alpheeon manufactures data that demonstrate the comparison of Alpheeon with Roferon-A (agent structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients the efficacy of Alpheum was compared with the efficacy of the reference serum to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was stopped (i.e. no indication of the virus in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail @ emea.eu.int © EMEA 2006 Reproduction and / or distribution of this document is Authorised for non commercial purposes only provided the EMEA is acknowledged</seg>
<seg id="2669">Concerns have also been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed is not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After the treatment with Alpheon, the disease cleared again in more patients than with the reference medicament; in addition, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from that, the test used in the study was not sufficiently validated to determine the extent to which the medicine triggers an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug).</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for the treatment of impetigo (a skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected lains (cracking or cutting wounds), abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used for the treatment of infections which have been proven or probably caused by methicillineal Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), because alarms may not work against this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients less than 18 years, the area to be treated must not exceed 2% of the body's surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibits the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection had been cleared after the treatment ended.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients treated with placebo responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin patients, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together on skin wound, about 90% of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo was not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (eitermed cavities in the body tissue) or infections which were demonstrably or probably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is a irritation at the site.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee on Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo were outweighed in short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected minor infirings, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted the Glaxo Group Ltd. a licence for placing Altargo in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined and an alternative therapy should be taken into consideration (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of sensitization or severe local irritation by applying retapamulin ointment, the treatment should be aborted, the ointment is carefully wiped out and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection will begin.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not intended to treat infections in which MRSA is known or suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials of secondary infections, the efficacy of reapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or worsening of the infected position occurs after a 2-3 day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of the simultaneous use of retapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been investigated and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">A clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not to be expected due to the low plasma concentrations, which were achieved in humans after topical application on abraded skin or infected surface wounds (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 According to the simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of ketoconazole, the mean retapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx according to topical application of 1% Retapamin- Salbe increased by 81% in healthy adult men.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dosh adaptations are not required if topical retapamulin is used during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement on effects on the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapaminoine ointment should only be applied during pregnancy, when a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retapaminoa is preferable to the application of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">When deciding whether to continue / stop breastfeeding or continue the therapy with Altargo, it is necessary to weigh between the benefits of breastfeeding for the baby and the benefit of Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which have applied to Altargo, the most common adverse event was Irritation at the date of performance that concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mechanism of action of retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction with a specific binding site of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data suggest that the binding site of ribosome protein L3 is involved and lies in the region of the ribosomal P binding site and the peptidyltransferase center.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Through binding to this binding site, pleuromutiline blocks the peptide transfer, partially block P-binding sites interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If, due to the local prevalence of resistance, the application of reapamulin at least some forms of infection appears to be questionable, advice should be sought by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">No differences were observed in the in-vitro activity of retapamulin to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-response to treatment with S.aureus, the presence of strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% reapaminoculine ointment was applied daily under occlusion and applied to scented skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">From 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Samples were taken on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and with the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic inclusion in humans after topical application of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 of scanned skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) was 660 times lower than the retapaminoid IC50 for the PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retapamulin in human liver microscopy was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, with low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg) performed over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro-check on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in rats-microkernel test for in-vivo investigation of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There were no signs of restricted fertility in male nor female rats at oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which resulted in an up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2 of skid skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study of rats, ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (≥ 3-fold of estimated human exposure), development stoxizity (reduced body weight of foetus and delayed Ossification) and maternal toxicity were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The owner of the marketing authorization must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system, as presented in module 1.8.1 of the marketing application (Version 6.2), is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is applied.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The holder of the authorisation for the placing on the market is obliged to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities in the pharmacovigilance plan, as described in the version 1 of Risk Management Plan (RMP) and in module 1.8.2 of the authorisation application, as well as all additional updates of the RMP agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for Human use," the updated RMP is to be submitted at the same time with the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms at the treated place, you should quit the application of Altargo and talk with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not use any other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with Altargo if it is not specifically prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in the eyes, mouth, or lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children between 1 and 15 years of age, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of a vaccination program consisting of two doses, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is taken.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection while immunization, and ensures that the vaccination already exists from two doses can be brought to an end.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is desired against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"" "vaccines work by" "" "teaching" "" "the immune system (the natural defense of the body) as it can defend itself against a disease." ""</seg>
<seg id="2728">"" "after receiving the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface antigens as" "" "foreign" "" "and produces antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components as the vaccine approved since 1996 and the vaccination of the Twinrix children registered in 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, however, twofold adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a vaccine existing in three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults have also been used as evidence of the use of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children, who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study involving 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix initiated a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B, between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix was similar to a six-month and a 12-month gap between injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, lack of appetite, pain in the injection point, redness, fatigue (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other constituents or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002, the European Commission granted the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s.a. a permit for the placing of Ambirix on the whole</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standard vaccine for primers with Ambirix is made up of two vaccines, with the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refresher vaccination is desired both for hepatitis A and for hepatitis B, the appropriate vaccines or combination vaccines can be vaccinated.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibody levels are the same as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured whether immunocompetent persons, who have addressed a hepatitis C vaccination, need a refresher vaccination as protection, as they may be protected even in non-detectable antibodies by the immunological memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection-vaccines, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available for the rare case of anaphylactic reaction after the gift of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, the standard vaccine is recommended with the combination vaccine, which contains 360 ELISA units of formalin-inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In hemodialysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, there may be no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs-antibody-value after the basic immunization, so that additional doses of doses may be necessary in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since intraocular injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscles could lead to a suboptimal inoculation, these injection methods should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, in case of thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disorders, Ambirix can be injected subcutanously as an exception, as it can occur in these cases after intramuscular administration of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was administered in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined diphtherie-, tetanus, acellular pertuss-, inactivated poliomyelitis- and Haemophilus influenza vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects, it must be assumed that an adequate immune response may not be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the incidence of pain, redness, swelling, maturation, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thiomerisation and preservative-containing vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccines were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to 15 years, the compatibility of Ambirix was compared with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and weariness on a basis of calculation per vaccine, but not based on a calculation basis for each person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the administration of Ambirix in 50.7% of the subjects compared to 39.1% in the subjects after the dose of the 3-doses-combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of patients who received Ambirix reported pain, compared to 63.8% in the subjects vaccinated with the 3 dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of maternation was comparable per proband (i.e. over the entire vaccine rate at 39.6% of the subjects who received Ambirix) compared to 36.2% in the subjects receiving the 3-doses-combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of severe pain and maturation was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 doses vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1- to 11-year-old vaccines, the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the ambient group was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3 doses combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalin-inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix a frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccine candidates who reported serious side effects during the 2-doses-vaccine with Ambirix or during the 3 doses vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of formalin-inactivated hepatitis B and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to 15 years, the rate conversion rates for anti-HAV 99,1% were one month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">Sero conversion rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted at 12-including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses received Ambirix and 147 the standard combination vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunogenicity was evaluable, the disinfection rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher against Hepatitis B in month 2 and 6 following the administration of the 3 dose imp vaccine than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The responses received in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11-year-olds one month after the full vaccine series (i.e. in month 7) are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccines received either a 2-doses-vaccination scheme with Ambirix or a 3 doses vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">The persistence of anti-HAVs and anti-HBs antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunreaction observed in this trial against both antigens was comparable to that detected after vaccination of 3 cans with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical trial at 12 - including 15-year-olds, it could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAVs and anti-HBs antibodies can be compared 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 month vaccination scheme to that in the 0-12 month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose Ambirix was administered at the same time with the refresher of a combined diphtherie-, tetanus, acellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis and 8 Haemophilus influenza vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with the first dose of a combined measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar seroprotective and sero conversion rates for the present formulation as for the previous formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is to be examined both before and after the resuspening of any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2805">Based on the data that has been known since the initial approval for the placing of the market, the CHMP believes that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix was placed in traffic only in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammountaps can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or hyperammonium encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammountaps - split by several single doses to meals - are swallowed, mixed with food or administered via a gastrointestinal barrier (through the abdominal wall into the stomach of the leading hose) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study because ammonaps could not be compared with another treatment or placebo (a placebo-based drug, that is, without drug).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammount can also lead to loss of appetite, abnormal acid content in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste malaise, stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee on Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that ammonites in patients with disturbances of the urea cycle were effectively prevented from high ammonia levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "Ammonaut was approved in" "" "exceptional circumstances" "" "because of the rarity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information on this drug was presented." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients, in which a complete enzyme shortage has already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifeste form (incomplete enzyme defect that manifests after the first month of life) there is an indication of the use if hyperammonium encephalopathy is present in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with hiccups, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually considering the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to the previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose sodium ylbutyconcentrate is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg, as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornithin bamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with arginine synthetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered to patients with swallowing disorders as there is a risk of the formation of esophagus ulcera if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium ylbutyate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">For this reason, AMMONAPS should be used only with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency as well as with sodium retention and edema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Because metabolization and excretion of sodium-phenylbutyate takes place via the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The significance of these results in pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate to young rats at high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg), it was a slowdown of neuronal propagation and increased neuron loss.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functional nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be established whether phenylacetate is excreted in humans into breast milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during the lactation period (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS at least one adverse event (AE) occurred in 56% of patients and 78% of these adverse events were considered not to be associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with lactate, severe hypokalemia, armortopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdosing occurred in a 5 month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity during an intravenous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolically active compound that is acetylated with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted through the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is similar to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disturbances of the urea cycle can be thought to be produced for each gram containing sodium-phenylbutyate between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is started immediately in order to improve the chances of survival and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infant, and the disease itself led to death even in the treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with its nitrogen-free analogues.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Through hemodialysis, the utilization of alternative ways of nitrogen excretion (sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenyl acetate), protein-reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate newborn at postpartum (however within the first month of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">Patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of the pregnancy and which had already been treated before the first occurrence of hyperammonium encephalopathy was the survival rate of 100%, but even in these patients it occurred with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-manifest form of the disease (including female patients with heterozygotic form of the Ornithinker bamylase deficiency), which were recovered by a hyperammonium cephalopathy and then permanently treated with sodium ylbutyrat and a protein-reduced diet, survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible even in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyl acetate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated with glutamine in the liver and kidneys with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and metabolites in plasma and urine were measured after a single dose of 5 g sodium ylbutyate on sober healthy adults and in patients with disturbances of the urea cycle, haemoglobin exchange and liver cirrhosis, as well as repeated donations of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (not controlled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients after IV administration of sodium ylbutyate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium methylbutyrate in tablet form, 15 minutes after taking measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urea cycle disturbances or hemoglobin opathies, phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) was not detectable next morning after night fasting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis of liver cirrhosis, which were repeatedly treated with sodium ylbutyrat (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the average phenylacetate concentrations were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medication is excreted within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">After the results of the Micronucleus test, sodium phenylbutyate did not have any adverse effects in rats treated with toxic and non-toxic cans (examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granules are either taken orally (infants and children who can not swallow tablets, or patients with swallowing disorders) or via a gastrostomy or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to the previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose sodium ylbutyconcentrate is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg, as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornithin bamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS garnet contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium ylbutyate, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium ylbutyate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat-flutes were exposed before the birth of phenylacetate (active metabolite of phenylbutyrat), lesions were found in the pyramid-cells of the brain-bark.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with lactate, severe hypokalemia, armortopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Stoichometrically seen is phenylacetylglutamine comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for excretion of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of investigations on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disturbances of the urea cycle, it can be assumed that for each gram sodium-phenylbutyate is produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine-nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible even in treatment, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium methylbutyrate in granulate form, 15 minutes after taking measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of durability, the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">This procedure contains the small measuring spoon 0,95 g, the medium measuring spoon 2,9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.6 g sodium ylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medicine by a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium-phenylbutyrat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate in the body after consuming proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">You must inform the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS since sodium phenylbutyrat can influence the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">If you take AMMONAPS with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During the lactation period, you may not use AMMONAPS as the medicine may pass into breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases, confusion, headaches, malfunction disorders, refraction of hearing, disorientation, memory disorders and worsening of existing neurological conditions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you notice any of these symptoms, contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency room of your hospital for initiation of appropriate treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiotherapy is used to treat adult patients with "acute coronary syndrome" (ACS, reduced blood flow to the heart), for example in unstable angina (a form of pain in the chest with different thickness) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "stress" (an abnormal measurement value of the electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiomox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who undergo a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14,000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS in which the effect of angiomyelia was compared with a single dose or in combination with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug aimed at preventing blood clots) compared to conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI was used a stent (a short tube remaining in the artery to prevent a closure) and they also received other medicines to prevent blood clots, such as abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, Angiox - with or without a gift of GPI - was as effective in preventing new events (deaths, heart attacks or revascularization) after 30 days or one year as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who underwent a PCI, Angiox was as effective in terms of all indicators as heparin, except for severe bleeding during which it was much more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiomodine may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bidoprudine, other hirudine, or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who recently had bleeding, as well as people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee on Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the treatment of ACS and a PCI is an acceptable substitute for heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit for the company The Medicines Company UK Ltd to approve the transfer of angiomox across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina / non-ST lifting infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of emergency intervention or early intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initialdose of angiomox in patients with ACS is an intravenous return of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is used in a further sequence, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the operation is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resumed for 4 to 12 hours after the clinical requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure, a bolus release should be administered from 0.5 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dose of angiomox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous infusion of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and one immediately followed intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of an all-in-one bolus-offering of angiomox has not been investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed before the application and the bolus dose can be administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">A lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate renal function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT-value is below 225 seconds, it is recommended to administer a second Bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg and recheck the ACT 5 minutes after the second dose of the bolt.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate renal damage, which were included in the phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which led to approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after the application of the Bivaliant-Bolus without dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients are contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angiomox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intravenous administration of fractionated heparin or 8 hours after the subcutaneous administration of low molecular lifting.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• hypersensitivity to the active substance or other constituent or against Hirudine • active hemorrhages or increased risk of bleeding due to a disturbance of the hemostasis system and / or irreversible bacterial endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when bidoprudin is given in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if the majority of hemorrhages occur in patients suffering from arterial coronary artery occlusion, patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may be bleeding during treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taking Warfarin and treated with Bivaliant, a monitoring of the INR (International Regular Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after settling treatment with Bivaliddin is again achieved prior to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anticoagulants (heparin, warfarin, thrombocyte aggregators), it can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In combination with thrombocyte aggregators or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemostasis parameters are checked regularly.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Animal experimental studies are inadequate in regard to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, obstruction or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomised to Bivaliferine alone, 4604 were randomised to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and 4603 were randomised to either unfractionated heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the Bivaliant group and in the comparison groups treated with Heparin, women and patients more than 65 years of age were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding was defined according to ACUITY and Timi standards for severe bleeding like in the footnotes of Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa-Inhibitor and Bivalidin plus GPIIb / IIIa- Inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intraarterial, retroperitoneal, intraocular hemorrhage or bleeding in the punctual area, reducing the haemoglobin mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with well-known bleeding point, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Other, less frequently observed hemorrhages that occurred at more than 0.1% (occasionally) were "other" points of the spot, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information on side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with Bivaliant in 6000 patients who underwent a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivaliant group and in patients treated with Heparin, women and patients more than 65 years of age were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects not listed above have been reported in practice after extensive use and are grouped according to system organsies in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of an overdose, the treatment with Bivaliant is to be stopped immediately and the patient is closely meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiomox contains Bivaliferine, a direct and specific thromboinhibitor, which binds both the catalytic centre and the anionic region of Thrombin, regardless of whether thromboin is present in the liquid phase or in clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of bicvaliferine to thromboin, and thus its effect, is reversible, because Thrombine is slowly splitting up the binding of Bivaliant-ARG3-Pro4, thus regenerating the function of the active center of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, Bivalirudin with serum from patients who had come to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS) did not induce a thrombocytes aggregate reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and in patients, Bivaliddin shows a dose and concentration-dependent anti-coagulatory effect, which is proved by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was performed with the patient below, an additional bolus of 0.5mg / kg of bicvaliant should be given and the infusion for the duration of the procedure is increased to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study, fractionated heparin or Enoxaparin was given in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary artery disease (ACS) in patients with unstable angina / non-ST lifting attacks (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used for the treatment of adults, adolescents and children from six years onwards with diabetes that require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneously (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs or the upper arm or administered as a continuous infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose (sugars) in the blood or cannot effectively process insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs very slightly from human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has shorter active life than a short acting humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in the application in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, where insulin cannot be operated effectively, Apidra has been studied in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was to change the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with Type 1 diabetes in adults, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed after six months compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin craper.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the lowering of the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin lulisin or any of the other components, or in patients who already suffer from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH a licence for placing Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra can be applied as subcutaneous injection either in the abdominal wall, thigh or delta muscle or subcutaneously by continuous infusion in the abdominal area.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, insulin requirements in patients with a reduction in liver function can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the effective strength, the brand (producer), insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc-retarded etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the production method can result in a change in insulin requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A inadequate dosage or discontinuation of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, may lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. these conditions are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Changing a patient to another insulin type or an insulin produced by another manufacturer should be conducted under strict medical supervision and may necessitate a change of dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of reoccurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment plan.</seg>
<seg id="2983">Substances that increase blood sugar-lowering activity and increase the propensity to hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, hydroamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, monoamine oxidase, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulfonamide.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, symptoms of adrenergic regulation can be weakened or missing under the effect of sympathies such as beta blockers, clonidin, guanethidine and reserpine.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin lulisin passes into human breast milk, but in general insulin is not absorbed into the mother's milk nor is it resorbed to oral use.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are the undesired drug interactions known from clinical trials, grouped according to system organsities and classified by decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rarely: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10; not known (frequency based on available data is not predictable).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold sweat, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, concentration problems, drowsiness, excessive dog, changes in vision, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">In order to continuously change the injection point within the injection area, lipodystrophies will be able to perform a lipodystrophy at the injection point.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemia with loss of consciousness can be treated by means of intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), given by an appropriately trained person, or by intravenous injection of glucose by a physician.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glufagonal injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose consumption (especially through skeletal muscles and fat) and inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that insulin-lulisin takes place more quickly in the subcutaneous GA- be of insulin-lulisin and the active time is shorter than with cou- mane normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study of 18 male individuals at the age of 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes moll- tus, insulin lulisin showed a glucosity-related effect of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg in the therapeutic-relevant dosage range of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg, exactly like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucosal effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data showed that an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal results in a similar post-dialydial glycaemic control as with a human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Insulin lulisin was purchased 2 minutes before the meal, a better postoperative check was achieved than with the human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">When applied to insulin lulisin 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a similar glycaemic control is achieved, as with human normal insulin, which is given 2 rents before meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisin at a dose of 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the start of the meal compared to human normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes before the meal (Figure 1A) as well as compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin lulisin at a dose of 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the start of the meal compared to human nor- malinsulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
