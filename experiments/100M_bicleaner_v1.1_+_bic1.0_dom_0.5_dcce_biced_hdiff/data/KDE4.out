the package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making it more readily available .
further information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select settings extensions ... Open the card card tools and select the modules you want .
this is a list of default configuration modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that you may need more modules on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , which contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Tools crashes . then you can view the page that has taken &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crashes , if present .
the module An@@ consider@@ ate ( also known as folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras An@@ consider@@ ate Fil@@ ters . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
to use DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as default starts the display with the root node of the document , for example : document@@ ati , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with the MI@@ ME @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of plot@@ ting ne@@ sted hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map . tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose area is proportional to its size .
with &amp; FS@@ View ; the size reflects the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can be easily detected even if they are far below the folder hierarchy . consequently , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you will be considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap presentation is a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles feature meaningful colour and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched to color mode , can be either depth for easy recognition of the ne@@ sting depth or representation of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space for representation , or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rec@@ tan@@ gles is to be used ( and therefore , display errors are caused by restrictions in the mark of the Tre@@ em@@ ap ) . in addition , you can set the relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rect@@ angle .
for Tre@@ em@@ ap performance algorithms , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always respected . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rect@@ angle is square .
how to partition the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . here , it is always advantageous for the lab@@ eling and avoid@@ ance of space losses through frames so that rec@@ tan@@ gles are created that are as square as possible . the best methods in this respect are lines , columns or recur@@ sive branches .
you can specify the minimum displayed area for an entry on the menu entry View on area . instead , a space pattern is drawn into the area of the higher @-@ level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally it was &amp; FS@@ View ; conceived as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
you can find the Picture Gallery in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
when you visit the Picture Gallery , a dialog opens with which you can set the image of the gallery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tit@@ le &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; option allows you to edit the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the option images per line has a slider and a screen@@ shot to adjust the number of mini@@ pictures of each line in the gallery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; An@@ tick &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; box of the image , specify whether the file names are shown in the gallery under the mini pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the check box file size of the image , specify whether the file size is displayed under the mini pictures in the gallery .
display the image size check box to determine if the size of the images is displayed in the gallery .
in the dialog folder , specify where the gallery is saved and which sub@@ folders should be included .
in the File selection Save to HTML file , specify where the HTML page should be saved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check box &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; panel , you can set the sub@@ folder to which level the sub@@ folders are included . &quot; &quot; &quot;
use the check box to copy original pictures to see if the original pictures should be copied to the gallery .
with the input field comment file you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of images in the gallery .
in the check box sel@@ e colour depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nail pictures than in the original pictures .
the module &amp; HTML ; Settings gives you easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; Settings can be found in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam ; download more than 1000 digital cameras using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , each medium and every card reader who is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
&amp; digi@@ code ; contains quick image editing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can easily be expanded with K@@ DE Image plugin interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ kam , it is easy to use , dozens of professional capabilities are available . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support raw batch conversion with li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC colour management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as eg ; over the camera or lens that can be searched .
as all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ code ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvement opportunities .
wherever you are in the program , the Help menu contains an entry problems or requests report .... This will open a dialog with an under@@ lined link . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error report system . all required information is already listed here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to ask you to help other users of &amp; digi@@ kam . however , in this mailing list English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
you can also visit the digi@@ code ; visit homepage to find news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam .
the best start to get to &amp; digi@@ kam ; to participate is registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for login to the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when you are digi@@ ti@@ zed ; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the path name or click the Fol@@ der icon Fol@@ der icon to select a folder .
in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data file is saved . this path stays the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ code ; will also use as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek . digi@@ code settings set up collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder containing the images as a base folder . &amp; digi@@ code ; look at every sub@@ folder as an album .
&amp; digi@@ code ; thir@@ sts recur@@ sively the library path throughout its depth . you cannot exclude sub @-@ folders unless there is i@@ ste in hidden folder . this can be done by bar@@ bs &amp; digi@@ kam ; do this by inser@@ ting a point in front of the folder name .
if you take an existing folder with photos as root folders , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ List do not have photos as icons . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and disc@@ arding this on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up in &amp; digi@@ pt ; your digital camera . then you should learn how to use My Albums and My Key@@ words to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , so &amp; digi@@ tis ; possibly handle with it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported blank cameras in the Help Menu assistance menu .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in sections Ro@@ h decoder settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam ; download more than 1000 digital cameras using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , each medium and every card reader who is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash , Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) . for actual transfer to the computer , the camera is often used as a USB mass storage device .
Photo@@ 2 is a free , distribut@@ able software collection for digital cameras , which supports a steadily increasing number of more than 800 cameras . G@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol developed by the International Ima@@ ging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and trans@@ missions via the serial port are slow , this connection is now obsol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ code ; supports these cameras and results in the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
the ex@@ if support is needed by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera operators to read the thumb@@ nails . if the ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might not be able to see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things to do with digi@@ tis@@ ation is how easy it is to extend its functionality by adding modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is a joint module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and g@@ wen@@ view to develop . the goal is to provide the modules with all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as a user can . their advantage is that it is much simpler , and digi@@ ti@@ zed ; by writing a small module to add a function than the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
drawing and dropping pictures works everywhere : you can put an image in another part of the tree , over the horizontal separation line or another application window . the only limitation is that a picture may not be stored in terms of keyword , date list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is only used for the fields currently displayed in the symbol view . in this way , the filter will only work on the fil@@ en@@ ame when this is also displayed in the symbol view . which fields can be displayed in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ ign Settings dialog .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos , which were edited by &amp; digi@@ kam , are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the al@@ ben@@ dings or after the date on which the album was first created . the date can be changed in the features of the album .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select album im@@ porting images . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album .
to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the then appearing menu , you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . you can also move or copy several photos in the same way . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album features , right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu .
album collections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection from you is used to sort your photos after collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do so in the settings for collections .
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with View Album ... sort by date .
the El@@ dest , A@@ verage , New Year &apos;s buttons : these set the date to the date of the oldest , the newest picture or the average of the album . first try to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of last change of each file is used in this folder instead .
when you first opened an album in &amp; digi@@ kam , the first picture in the album will be chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as Album symbol , right click on the picture and click in the context menu &amp; quot ; As an album preview en@@ quot ; . in addition , you can drag the photo onto the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can always be included in a collection and collections can &apos;t be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ code ; supports input of key words for single photos in the area My Key@@ word list on the bottom of the main window . album collections always have a different effect . the collection always includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the picture window provides you with the main view of your photos . when you select an album , all images in this album are displayed in the picture window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of these thumb@@ nails with the two magni@@ fier buttons in the tool@@ bar .
when you open an album the first time , you must wait short while the thumb@@ nails are generated . this can help you avoid using all thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu .
information on each image is displayed below the corresponding preview . what information this is , you can edit settings digi@@ code ; edit the albums page and adjust the thumb@@ nail area to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails feature help buttons , which appear when you leave the mouse over a picture . the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the introduction to the main window shows such a help window .
photos are all about digi@@ tis@@ ation ; go . albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures in a way that suits you . the image editing shows your photos and allows you to reach a number of improvements to them . you can choose all the features with &amp; digi@@ kam . you can choose between viewing the images , a slide show or editing the images .
you can open the image processing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 image editing ... or selecting the contex@@ tual menu of the image with the right mouse button and selecting Edit ... . in the editing pane , you will find instructions on how to edit your photos . with image editing , you can view and change your photos .
you can open a photo in another program by right @-@ clicking the context menu and selecting the program from the open sub @-@ menu . the applications listed there are checked by the &amp; k@@ de ; file assignments for the file type . you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after processing other image editing programs , there may be problems with the metadata contained in the image . some programs do not save these data when you save the modified image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc .
&amp; digi@@ code ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest option is to right click on the thumb@@ nail to select and rotate . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photo , right @-@ click on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam , it is moved to the garbage dump of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 Image Del@@ ete or Del In case you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
the View &amp; quot ; My date list ; organizes your photos based on the data . &amp; digi@@ code ; use either the EX@@ IF date or , if it is not available , the date of last modification of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the date view to show you only the photos of the days selected .
photos with keyword provides a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned individual photos or entire groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found through the selection of this keyword or a search again .
if a keyword is selected , all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . by this you can organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Key@@ word list &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so that you can easily find the key words you are looking for . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and allocated keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . so you can also use your keywords in other programs . besides , the keywords are re @-@ imported from the loss of the database when &amp; digi@@ kam ; the pictures are noticed .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking on &amp; quot ; My keyword ; or click on an existing keyword , then select New keyword . if you click a new keyword after clicking on an existing keyword , this keyword will be the subject of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by dra@@ gging it to the desired location in the tree and dropping it there . then a menu appears which gives you the possibility to post@@ p@@ one the keyword . a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree .
you can change the properties of a keyword by right @-@ clicking it and selecting a keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the icon in the tree &amp; quot ; My template .
to select another photo as Album symbol , select the picture with the right mouse button and set in the context menu as an album preview . in addition , you can drag the photo onto the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
this can be done in two ways : once you select the photos you have selected with a keyword , you can drag them to the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords . alternatively , you can also right @-@ click on the preview of the images and select cue from the context menu .
you can add a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can select a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event in which it was made etc .
once you have selected a photo with keyword , this will be displayed under the preview of the image in the main window .
you can remove a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select from the Del@@ ete key menu . the menu only shows you the key words assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ dependent adjusted hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved using this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you just have to click on the bottom rect@@ angle of the selection frame , which indicates the time unit . this will display all associated images in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection , which will appear in the list below .
include all database elements : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and more .
when you click here , the filtering will be deleted and all images are displayed again . if the search hasn &apos;t found anything , then the lamp will be red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab on the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this you get a simple search box as described above . you can save this search here but as a live search , which always filter what you entered as a search criterion .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search will be performed . the results will be used in the View My search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after the search again , you only need to select the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu .
if you choose to edit search , the form to enter the search appears with the previously entered search information . if you choose to edit as advanced search , the dialog appears for the advanced search to change your previous search . here you will find more rules for searching . for more information , see the section The Tool for Advanced Search .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Cre@@ ate in the context menu .
the Advanced search provides you with an extended search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ code ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the al@@ b database . all rules are added row wise , separated by operators . one option can be added to this list with search group / search group . each option can be linked with others via the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ...
&amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this makes it possible to compare images by comparing these signatures . the less the difference between two image signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar items : this is an area in which you can om@@ it any image to find a similar . if you push a picture from somewhere over the icon of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , it will open and you can let it fall there .
sketch : free hand color sketch : draw a quick sketch and &amp; editing ; find the right pictures . here too , a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map finder tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can move in or out with the mouse wheel or drag it . move it while you press the left mouse button . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to pull a square . of course , all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
in the field below you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for a later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ code ; provides a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L to add the be@@ acon from the context menu . the selection is added to the light table and its window opens .
from the preview bar , you can drag and drop the images you want to see in the left or right area of the window . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area you can see . if you select preview syn@@ cing from the tool@@ bar and perform zo@@ ological and move operations on one of the images , then you will also be able to compare the same area of both images .
another mode is better suited to quickly sort out a picture series . if you are using pair @-@ wise navigate from the tool@@ bar , then both first images are automatically loaded into the areas to compare . now , use the left mouse button in any preview screen to display it in the left side .
of course , normal dele@@ tion actions also work directly from the light table , e.g. F@@ 4 file editing ....
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the illuminated table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
in the lower end of each section you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function that you can see on the crossed arrows . in order to swing the visible area of the picture , you must click it and hold down the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the preview mode , both images will display the same image area .
the zoom functions as well as in other views . just use the zoom knob under the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and out . this is done in both images if you are previ@@ ew@@ ing in the preview mode .
digital inventory management considers each part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to the final issue and permanent storage . each of the photos received , scans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up , find , protect , protect , re@@ organize , group , secure , evaluate , group , archive , optimize , maintain and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital asset management picks up , inde@@ xes , categ@@ ori@@ zes , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , manufactures and export content that has a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is based on your definition data that provides information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
I venture to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you do not need to find a certain photo without inventory management . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you definitely do not use &amp; digi@@ code ; . the approach to store the metadata in both a database and in the image files guarantees very fast searches and a secure archiving which you can access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate anything into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you must decide whether or not you want to save them to a reserved drive , or on a network drive , etc .
you may be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can be quickly found about your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; then export is a folder for images you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have different requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , workflow , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new files from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative picture .
we also recommend that metadata can be saved to the file &apos;s preferences page ; enable it . this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written to the file . if you forget , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database to the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ones ? edited by digi@@ cam ; they provide a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work starts , as you should now choose any photo keywords , cap@@ tions and a review . of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value then . this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos in the further work .
now let &apos;s start with keywords , keywords , as you often call other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ code ; automatically insert the tree for you or insert the images in the right place . the sorting of the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by drawing a sub @-@ tree to another .
the graphic shows how different metadata is overl@@ apping itself . this is a very rough representation as each block of metadata is in truth composed of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar dates are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
most people don &apos;t want to see your photos only , they want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies .
look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mans 60 years after landing . wow ! you start dre@@ aming of having associations , memories , the historical time span is present again , you may even hear the silence . so the cap@@ tion has changed your perception of this panorama completely .
for others who view your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help him understand what you are moving about .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength to work only with a label for itself .
with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as cap@@ tion . you can even export it for a selection of images . if you export your images in web galleries , then these labels will be exported to your wishes in the cap@@ tion and / or title of the web gallery system .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without a navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is now with speed of light .
the possibilities of using ge@@ olo@@ cation are inn@@ um@@ erable and will become even deeper in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your journeys using images with geographic indications . &amp; digi@@ kam ; can also export k@@ ml files that you can open with Google Earth .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and describes the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you which information in the furnishing page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; should be stored as information :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the photographer &apos;s name , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization may not be changed .
author title : linked to the author . this field contains the job title of the photographer . examples of this can be titles like : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer .
editor ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer works for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here , which you offer the picture to others .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not offer protection against mis@@ use . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator can delete or modify this , in the picture . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire . these types of losses are the same that can happen to you even on traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives .
K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss .
in order to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , they need to be treated cau@@ ti@@ ously and you can &apos;t buy you longer than a couple of years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality that last longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers over gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much more reliable . so it is about choosing the right one .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors even if you have just written . that &apos;s why they use a check@@ sum mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data is only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control sum@@ mers . despite this massive protection they age through chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for faulty CDs and DVDs there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently works wonders for CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux , but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to capture the format war against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
do not burn the media with a description , date &amp; author identi@@ fier and then store in a clean , dark dry and in front of animals protected site . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
Disk@@ label keeps your statistics for themselves . their manufacturer &apos;s guarantees include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard drives on this subject : flo@@ ppy study
electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of failure , S@@ MA@@ RT cannot detect these errors . some of the errors identified by S@@ MA@@ RT prec@@ lu@@ de the imminent drop . this is especially read errors and shift counter . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can normally be restored without major problems .
while most electrical devices do not matter much , this can cause serious damage on devices with computer chips and high speed processors . these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause serious damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause closed key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware alter@@ ation , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . so protect yourself from the inevitable result in a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against current peaks is over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and gro@@ unded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar . remember , however , that not every connector also includes over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should ensure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are also protected . some manufacturers produce over@@ voltage sha@@ kes which also include a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ ax cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a laptop , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are especially designed for not@@ ebooks and are therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it may therefore make sense to invest in an un@@ interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protecting against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs . some models allow you to store your data and run down the system . if you buy a U@@ PS then you should be sure that it meets the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting .
consider the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with the cost of avoiding it . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can cost you up to &amp; euro ; 20 cost , A 500@@ W U@@ PS can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 .
Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software .
however , compared to the hard drives at home you are very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data about the comparatively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are linked to photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online .
from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very safe . data transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and with the big companies included in the offer is a backup and a distributed memory .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all transfers are prone to transmission errors .
the worst thing is that nobody tells you when this occurred in your hardware . all these interrup@@ tions remain und@@ et@@ ected until one day you open a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise . it is quite disturbing that there should be no protection in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not currently affected by transfer problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates that can handle plate errors on a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard under the GP@@ L in@@ compatible license .
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . it is still in alpha state . it uses the same protective mechanisms that Z@@ FS uses and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it &apos;s not part of the kernel .
these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % of the work@@ station systems . in not@@ ebooks , the share of the@@ fts amounts to 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to reduced damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; for a long time nobody has been si@@ ghted .
open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss than proprietary systems : un@@ true , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most popular file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden break during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings removed from fundamental physical boundaries . it is meant that while technology continues to develop there is a natural limit for this advancement . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all kinds of light sensors are no longer far from this limit .
even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is rather deterior@@ ating . a sensor size of 6 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els and a high quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not blame anybody else for data loss . so , save your data according to a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous like the re@@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of disks or the res@@ izing of hard drives .
suppose you make your back@@ ups every day on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , lightning strikes you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget airplane crashes : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern an entire room or the entire house .
therefore des@@ aster prevention is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , a common reason for data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential lock : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot of two points of time : one of the complete backup and the last differential lock .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . generates multiple sn@@ apshots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup was made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference between the files that have actually been changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ss@@ h .
back up important images directly after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium .
at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . any further di@@ lution should happen manually , after which you have made a complete check .
topics : metadata , IP@@ TC stored in the image file , keeping associated X@@ MP files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ viewing images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing devices , ... , use of the Internet .
so valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years , that is approximately the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you have to consider everything that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate as time passes . unfortunately , you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered based on the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important for reading your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the technical expression for the ability to change a system in its size . this is actually increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and reloc@@ ate it to a new disk :
check with the d@@ mes@@ g command if your new disk has been detected by the system , but do not app@@ end it .
&amp; dollars ; dd if = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted resi@@ ze / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the disk in M@@ B@@ gt ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no more software to read , then you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year .
GI@@ F is a proprietary patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more .
it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 bits per colour channel and full transparency . the disadvantage is that it requires relative many administrative information , but not as many as TI@@ FF and has a slow compression .
TI@@ FF is widely used as image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or container with los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ ine ) . it manages images in high quality but requires very large files . with some cameras , you can store your images in this format . however , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a roy@@ alty @-@ free and open @-@ format image format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed on the basis of the need to standardi@@ ze camera res@@ sources . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and comm@@ its to the use of metadata .
this may be one of the reasons why , to replace Adobe &apos;s XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Image resource block quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a coding technology that allows users to em@@ bed their data into a file itself . the file information is saved with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; saved for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive the original image , mostly in raw format . X@@ MP fits as it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when linking the metadata file and the image file , and as noted above , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organization that supports fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of deployment and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modelling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI work@@ groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the c@@ amer@@ aman , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and store them in your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
for a subtle editing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images again &amp; edit , then you should add the metadata again .
protect the copy@@ ri@@ ghted images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them to web galleries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can add a description of how to add photos you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ code ; to use , connect it to the computer , turn the camera on the display mode and switch it . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
if you start the camera interface , it will try to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a finished Indi@@ c@@ ator will appear at the bottom end and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will be shown .
before downloading the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side bars properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the tab metadata shows the internal metadata such as the ex@@ if , manufacturer notice , GPS , etc of the image . this information is the same as with the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or the image processing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the button download and then download the selection of all . this loads all photos from their camera into a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam . at downloading , the photos are not deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all the photos , you can select only the desired with the default selection methods of &amp; k@@ de ; select the download button and then download Sel@@ ected . download the button Sel@@ ected until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New Download is available . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images will be downloaded .
if you are using the All or selected buttons you can select a dialog with which you can select the target album in which the photos are disc@@ arded . you can read the list of existing albums , such as normal folders . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ clip ; load the photos from the camera into the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete them all at once , by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete button . if you want to delete only some , you must first select them and delete the chosen deleted .
please note that there is no possibility to restore images you have deleted from the camera . so you should carefully check if the photos were successfully downloaded in a &amp; digi@@ code ; so you should carefully check if the photos were successfully removed from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera , you should do so via the camera , as this is much faster .
cameras often don &apos;t use a very meaningful name for the photos . the file names are normally recycled once the photos are deleted from the camera . this can lead to dup@@ licate file names if you load photos of different recording sets into the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image was taken into the file name .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for date @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder is automatically created per day .
the first two relate the data via the author in the standard car identity section . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the Ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the latest option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
for example , if you want a different date format than the default format , you can , for example , use the pre@@ fix photo@@ - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . turn on the option date &amp; time . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command .
if you use the optional camera file name , you can change the file names in lo@@ wer@@ case letters when downloading . or in capital letters if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ code ; used for a photo , is shown below the name which the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; digi@@ tis@@ ers ; can use all the information on the camera &apos;s orientation at the time point of the recording to make automatic la@@ the during the download . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar metadata , you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo .
the automatic turn is usually switched on , and when your camera does not deliver this information , the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window .
when your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was made , it can &amp; digi@@ code ; use this to automatically load sub @-@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras provide this information .
this option is usually turned off , and digi@@ ti@@ zed in this case ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you must turn on this option . use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to their camera is the button download . then select Up@@ load . the File selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded . you can also choose more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , ask &amp; digi@@ code ; you where the images should be uploaded . a folder drop @-@ down dialog for the camera appears . select the folder you want and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this refers to a position indicated in long@@ itude and lati@@ tude and which can be displayed on a map . the data can be as@@ cer@@ tained by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this capability .
if you have forgotten where exactly the photo was done , you can open a browser with a click that shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ er and map references .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receivers . either as a card module or through transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you need to store these data in g@@ p@@ x format , as this is the only format supported by the ge@@ o @-@ mapping module .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data from images and from the GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; do : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and lati@@ tude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Harv@@ ey . it uses the pre@@ characters , which are created by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle , for example .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish that show all the navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ code ; tries to give you so much control over his work procedures as possible . there are many settings that change the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam . in order to access these settings , you need to select Settings dialog ; you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side .
select action can be displayed on embedded preview or start image editing . so you set the default behavior of &amp; edited ; specify when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields , if the option was selected from the camera interface .
author title is a syn@@ onym for author field : this field should include the job title of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations such as a photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author field , this must also be filled .
editor is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the picture that offers the photo . this does not have to be the author if this is for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be registered here as this is the picture of others &amp; quot ; . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the appropriate IP@@ TC @-@ fields . this means that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam ; these metadata are also available to other programs and can be imported in &amp; digi@@ code without going missing .
image descriptions as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) save in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the labels embedded in the pictures .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse poin@@ ter is in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information will be displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ kam ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ code ; trying to display , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list .
you can reset the default settings again by pressing the Update button to the right of each category .
the settings of the light switch from &amp; digi@@ kam ; can be set to the default values on this page . however , each time you open the light table these settings will not be available . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available .
by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the tool@@ bar when you use image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or bright color in the picture . these colors are set here . in the image processing , this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with chro@@ ma @-@ sub@@ sampling it is meant that the images are coded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation .
with the P@@ NG compression setting you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality as P@@ NG uses a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression .
this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . it has no effect on image quality since the de@@ late algorithm works loss @-@ free .
with the loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files you can save los@@ s@@ less . even if you choose the los@@ s@@ less setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is much better than in normal JPEG . when this paragraph has been written , metadata has not yet been supported , but was in the planning .
in earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image editing was only an image viewer for photos . currently , it is very fast becoming a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing .
the standard capture is that all green pixels are equal . if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensi@@ tively to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels in odd lines , this difference creates a lat@@ tice pattern in the output .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images get more details in the top lights in four steps . for other cameras , this option is ignored .
the default is the pointed beam , so the parts of your images that have burned down due to the inability of your camera to catch the top lights than to look through white in the settings . the setting colors trigger some failed results , as they display the pointed @-@ lights in various pink tones . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights .
this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as quickly saturated as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red parts from the un@@ saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want .
if you select the re@@ construct option , you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the editing options of the &amp; digi@@ code ; in order to keep the time for the demo icing small , you should go conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the sub @-@ raw data captured by the color @-@ filtered image sensor that has many cameras and which provides a matrix of colored pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
after some tests it looks like A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ic @-@ Direc@@ ted ) created the quality for me and the paper used by me . V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color avoid@@ ance correction , as you are carried out during the conversion process .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given them again . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as color information from a color space in the other is to translate so that the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior questions when a picture is opened in image processing / color management module with raw files start .
color profile folders set the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can save all your profiles .
settings of the ICC @-@ Pro@@ files You have the option &amp; quot ; default source ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed when opening the raw file .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here only your images do not color the entire screen .
not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , like Canon , which do not include color mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma does not correct for conversion at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to do the mapping yourself .
there are other options such as the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile you can em@@ ulate as your picture would be given back from one device . this is very useful before you print image , since your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors may therefore have a very saturated effect .
for most cameras it is quite obvious what color profile is provided for . unfortunately not with Canon &apos;s models . therefore , here follows a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course , this answer is not official :
the Canon profile extension provides the style for the target : F for an accurate style , L for Land@@ sc@@ apes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the Standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface supported by a range of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing . by deplo@@ ying this interface , &amp; digi@@ code can support ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see a list of the available modules . select the modules you want to use , and these are then edited by &amp; digi@@ kam . these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition , you will also find some in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the Settings menu under Settings .
for more information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can get via the K@@ IP@@ I project at ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper control adju@@ sts the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom end of the pictures during the display .
the camera features show on the left side a list of all supported cameras . on the right hand side there is a button Automatic detection , which tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the picture @-@ line mode . currently , there are serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage devices .
at the bottom end you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you choose a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list .
to use digi@@ cam , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and switch on .
if you do not , you can manually set the camera model and port manually . once you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . it is displayed in the main window &apos;s C@@ ameras . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; images in the tr@@ ash bin , you can adjust the &amp; digi@@ code dialog ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you can find more details when del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album .
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly used &amp; edited ; if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without any feedback . otherwise , you must save the changes using the button changes .
you can also display the welcome screen from &amp; digi@@ kam ; in case of starting , it may speed up &amp; digi@@ code start @-@ up .
when something is deleted from the base folder , it asks &amp; digi@@ kam ; if something is to be deleted from the base folder , you will be asked if it is to delete them from the database .
various color schemes can be edited in &amp; digi@@ kam ; be used to customize the main window to your taste . you can select these settings from the tool@@ bar in Settings Design . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information about it in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ code ; contains quick image editing with some basic tools . you can use them to view and improve your photos and to correct and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry / edit entry .
the image editing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ .@@ You may not be part of your distribution .
a status bar at the bottom of the window showing the file name , current file number , magni@@ fying factor , and the current image size .
a menu bar on the top edge and among them the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of the image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you have used File Save or the Save button from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image .
so you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with File Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by restoring from the File Rec@@ over or the button Rest@@ ore the image processing Rest@@ ore in the tool@@ bar . you will then lose any change you have done in the photo since the last save .
virtually any image processing action can be und@@ one or restored . the last action you can undo by clicking Edit Rest@@ ore or Rest@@ ore by selecting Edit Rest@@ ore from the menu .
if you use this frequently , you should use the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to undo and note C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ switch @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press a moment longer via the undo or restore button in the tool@@ bar , you will get a context menu . if you select one of the menu items , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , image down , or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them .
you can enter in the photo and zoom out in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the View menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select En@@ large factor automatically
view full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you will see the normal view in which you are using the Es@@ c key . if you do not want to do so , you can change it in the Settings dialog of &amp; digi@@ kam . you can view it from the &amp; digi@@ code ; main window . see the section for setting up image editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can select the image in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; Print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before printing your photo .
from the main menu you can print single images or whole sets . whole picture pages can be selected from your selection . you only have to select the images with the standard methods and select the print wizard from the Album Export menu . if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice .
Das &amp; digi@@ kam ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation file , also in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple Click on the same tab let the side@@ bar appear or disappear into the margin .
the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied to EX@@ IF and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only supports ASCII characters and is limited to 2000 characters . all comments are trun@@ cated after 2000 characters and special characters are changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should consider these limitations .
after you have commented it , use either the Apply button or just switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved .
with this , you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always done when you choose a metadata setting that is always written in the images .
the review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and gra@@ ding . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut Str@@ g + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images simultaneously , select them and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC @-@ field of Re@@ gency . the code is followed by the scheme in the following table :
the keyword list shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword @-@ tree and a selection box with the keywords used before in this &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation session .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the given keyword . you can quickly limit the number of possibilities in search for a keyword . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is a further relief when entering keywords for a picture series . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , they are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding tick boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are keyword in the IP@@ TC @-@ field keyword .
if multiple images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the Key@@ word tree , this will only apply to the highlighted image and not the entire selection , if you want to add a keyword , please read the Key@@ word filter section .
the Key@@ word@@ Filter side bar is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar with their album is used - date , keyword and search views . if one or more keyword filters are used from the right @-@ hand side , only the intersection of these two will be displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also drag and drop tags . suppose you have selected multiple images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection .
in the upper example , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter is listed in no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected using C@@ tr@@ l + a , and then a keyword was drawn from the right keyword @-@ tree to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks whether this keyword should be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be disabled under Settings It@@ ems .
if you have created and created a rule and find that it needs to be one or more , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry in which the database is searched for . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or a string that is already set in the database .
you can , for example , set an Advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then select the group@@ ing button . the options then look like this :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web and Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? free storage space is limited to 1 GB and you won &apos;t want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I am mainly editing &amp; editing ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is the colors that come from your camera or scanner a predictable devi@@ ation from the actual photographed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can reach that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that match the colors you print or publish in the web to those from your digital dark@@ room .
when the theme comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at any point in the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should provide you with adequate background information via color management . in addition , you should enable you to make your own informed decisions so that you can get the desired result .
if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
your only other images are via email or the web where s@@ RGB is de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB is working so well and makes life so easy , why should you use another color space and worry about color management ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to install my monitor if I chose to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you work in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to al@@ locate your monitor , since s@@ RGB means that your ; on@@ itor to s@@ RGB is al@@ lied . if you are working as a s@@ RGB colour gam@@ er then you need either to al@@ locate your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , please use it before attempting any further manual processing .
the functions norm@@ alize , compensate , automatic offset and contrast expand from the Con@@ duc@@ ting Automatic Cor@@ rection menu attempt automatically to make the most of your colors . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the Leu@@ st@@ strengthened values across the whole picture so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest point as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magic correction for pictures that are dark or washed .
comparing : this method adju@@ sts the lumin@@ ous factor of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . sometimes the same number of pixels results in the improvement of the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation which causes either miracle in an image or it destro@@ ys it .
automatic comparison : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright border tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ ous intensity of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the wi@@ dest range and a new level of all values in between . this is only visible in selected pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance from &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is slightly restricted because of a color space with 8 @-@ bit per colour . if you are too far from the original picture , areas with over@@ exposure may occur . if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you can start it using the menu entry Color white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand side both the original image as well as the preview of the target image can be seen . the preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance , then click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of pixels under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
the hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well @-@ lit pictures , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . shadow adjustment lets you improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos .
to play with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the color temperature of the white balance to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . this way , the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the default settings list . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will see the combined result in the white balance . this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save As and Load buttons do exactly this . any setting of the white balance you have set can be saved to a text file and then rel@@ o@@ aded .
the Pre@@ ferences button res@@ ets all filter values back to its default values and the associated neutral white balance . note that neutral settings will also result in a different picture than your original . if you save it , your original image will be changed .
you can adjust the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the common JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . however , this coding requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as for editing raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be done by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed manual for using color profiles allows you to consult the ink management chapter .
another important tool is to find t@@ onal color correction in the menu . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously , so you can always use it for several photos . this is useful if your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and therefore always need the same correction .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find in colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
Das &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool color effects will provide you with four color effects , a solar effect effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in the age of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect of creating a partially developed pressure with a short flash light and afterwards completed the development of the image . this had the effect that the lighter areas were darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second lighting . the result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to fine @-@ adjust this interesting effect .
the intensity controls the solar process . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible .
this is an example of the solar energy effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and it processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . just try it , it beauti@@ ful@@ s many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted colour film produced by Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth picture structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast edges . the Level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large pictures , the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual for you to correct the color contrast and the lumin@@ ous intensity of the photos . you can experiment the different color areas of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjustment can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result , use the button OK and you will be applied .
when you make a photo with poor light conditions you can get the opposite problem : one too big satur@@ ation . also in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . all changes you can perform can be previ@@ ew@@ ed . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool Gra@@ dation and the simple Leu@@ ch@@ thickness / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is set to improve exposure . even if the dialogue with this tool works very complicated , you need only the range of slides for the purpose described here . more specifically , the three slide gates below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , active channel or the selected area . under the graph , three slide gates are cli@@ cked into and can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn how to use it is to move the slider to make sure that the picture changes .
on the right hand side , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview will be dynamic , based on the settings of the image , updated . on the left @-@ hand side , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : this selection box shows whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed using a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic classification is more useful .
three controllers : the top one for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma @-@ values .
the three colour twe@@ ets can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , medium and bright tones . furthermore , there is a button for fully automatic alignment .
output : the output values allow selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controls which can be used to change the output rate inter@@ actively as in the input values . for example , the compression of the output values can be used to create an extended picture as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save and load : using these buttons , the set values can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and then rel@@ o@@ aded . to do this , the Gim@@ p Levels format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette , the input is automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun shades . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below is an example of the adjustment of the input applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photograph . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
the left @-@ hand side displays half of the original and the target image . the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings . the following options are available on the right @-@ hand side :
modified duct : this selection box allows the channel to be specified , which is modified by the module :
in addition to this box there are two symbols to change between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for images taken with a digital camera , linear mode is mostly the most meaningful . for images with large areas of a constant color , linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode will help .
for example , if you shift a short section to the right , e.g. the bright tones , you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and that the corresponding pixels become darker .
on the preview of the original photo you can see a red marker . if you want to shift this selection to the area you want to change , a matching line will appear on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save and load : with these buttons you can do exactly that . any curve you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you use this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette buttons automatically create the curve control points for all channels of shadow , middle and sun tone . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel exposed pixels are found , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance Channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the digital channel mixer is a tool for improving the color channels or changing the color h@@ ues of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the color channel mixer of the image processing .
using the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and output . the left part of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed in comparison to your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram will display the corresponding color value .
controls for the module are right down : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate lumin@@ ance , the image will retain the overall brightness as well , since the channel mixer then is THE tool for creating great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise that comes from the colour space . colour@@ less consists of small diamond @-@ art@@ ef@@ acts that don &apos;t appear in the same place in the color channel and whose spatial pattern looks different in each channel . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion in which you can reduce the colour space first .
the Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any mixer setting can be saved for later and then load . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is activated . the original image can be seen under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a step in which colour images can be easily converted on the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green Fil@@ l : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green l@@ enti@@ l filter . this looks great , with all scenery pictures and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky .
orange Filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . so similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter .
Rot@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red l@@ enti@@ l filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate mo@@ on@@ light scenes at the time of day . thus , similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ ary .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural colour tone correction and improves contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : produces warm light and medium tones while adding a bit of cold in the saddle tones . this is very similar to the process of ble@@ aching a pressure and re@@ development in a se@@ pi@@ on oner . this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) se@@ pi@@ an .
with the &amp; digi@@ code ; apply tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , stit@@ ch an old master , a pop art portrait from enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper of text effect has been applied on the photo below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the relief parameter has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ code ; tool frame can be added a decorative frame to be added a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to retain his attention is to set the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
type : with this parameter , you set the desired frame type for your image . completely surrounded the picture with a colored line , ni@@ ce@@ ce surround it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , bent it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame that is ideal for a kno@@ cker effect and decorative adding an ornamental frame with patterns .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing images , especially if you have previously used the tool after aspect ratio .
with this handy tool , you can insert easily a format@@ ted text into a picture in any place . this also goes in several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . just enter the text and place it with the mouse . the larger the image , the bigger the character set must be . at the end , simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press &quot; OK . &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with the &amp; digi@@ code ; tool Tem@@ plate apply you can put a template on a picture .
the menu image template can be used in image processing can be used to place templates over a picture .
for the template there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation . however , you need to take the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . if you want to add your template of the template , just send an email in English to the &amp; digi@@ kam . mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the button root folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder for the template has been set appears a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . selecting a folder automatically updates the preview tool@@ bar of the templates .
under the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shr@@ inking : this button res@@ izes the underlying picture . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you must decrease the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the picture lying under the template . to do so , take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK when you want to apply the template to your image . the image is then automatically adapted to the thumb@@ nail size .
&amp; digi@@ code ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool to sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but produces , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images .
blu@@ r mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually it does not shar@@ pen any bit , it works rather psycho@@ visually . you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ st and it makes here a really good job . the algorithm was taken out of Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is probably the best of the three because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjusting .
images without a focus and most digital@@ ised images require a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the digi@@ tization process needs to be conden@@ sed with minimal differences . this in turn results in bl@@ urred edges a little blu@@ r . SL@@ R cameras usually require more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for home users .
images in the raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some sc@@ anners use a field of sharpen@@ ing already during the reading of the image . if you disable it , you will get control of your image .
in some situations you can obtain useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing value . this can be called with the menu entry Con@@ duc@@ ting Field .
you should deal with this carefully as the results do not work very natural : sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also rein@@ forces the noise . in general , the most suitable technique for sharpen@@ ing an image will re@@ focus the tool . you can re@@ focus it through the menu entry . under re@@ focusing , you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than it is to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ten the soft mark with the menu entry Con@@ duc@@ ting sof@@ ten@@ ers and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tried out first . an increase of the radius or the amount ampli@@ fies the effect . if you make the bl@@ urred mask too strong , noise and the impression of bur@@ r will create close to sharp edges .
the radius is how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , you should best sharp@@ est images in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the bl@@ urred image , which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applied difference amount . thus , a minimal difference can be defined thus for an edge of the filter . thus , areas with a soft altern@@ ation between the tones are excluded from sharp@@ ness and therefore beauty mistakes in faces , skies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the fu@@ zzy escap@@ ing filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur@@ ring is used with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 .
Das &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ focused re@@ focused a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright @-@ protected design @-@ filter algorithm of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to shar@@ pen an image to &amp; quot ; re@@ focused quot ; in which it revers@@ es the focus . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is using a blu@@ r mask . re@@ focusing typically achieves better results than bl@@ urred .
in practice , the circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s fold . the G@@ auss &apos;s fold has a very long tail , which causes the mathematical result also from the source pixel , which is far from the original source pixel . in most cases , the FI@@ R Wiener In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s fold is strongly influenced by the distant pixels . this causes un@@ desired results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should result in 1 good results .
correlation : an increase in correlation may help to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values close 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpen@@ ing effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , eg ; 0 the image quality is very poor .
G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the palate &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your blu@@ r is wrong . in most cases , you should om@@ it this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a value unlike zero , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you choose large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the palate . note , however , that the module is very slow if you choose large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all the trimm@@ ings , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that a lot of operations are not immediately visible , but leave behind unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts later .
when you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by the un@@ sharp mas@@ king of a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing .
even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of bl@@ ur@@ ring . for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal linear filter . practically the result of the FI@@ R Wiener filter is always at least as good as the bl@@ ur@@ ring mask . the FI@@ R Wiener Filter is often better in processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between different filters , on a small un@@ focused image , see :
this picture has been made with an an@@ alog@@ ous camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the methods of sharpen@@ ing in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English below this address .
the slider smoo@@ th@@ ens the blu@@ r of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the colour ink allows a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , you can adjust it here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings fine you can use the smoo@@ thing and Advanced Settings .
detail maintenance p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . a small value leads to smoo@@ ther smoo@@ thing over the picture . whereas larger values mainly smooth homo@@ geneous regions and make details sharp .
direction depen@@ dency Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes in all directions , while a value close to 1 is smoo@@ thed in one direction . if you have a film @-@ gra@@ ining or CCD slip will create a high value wave @-@ like pattern . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value close to 1 .
smoo@@ thing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all@@ . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , because it is difficult to set the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : speci@@ fies how often the algorithm is passed through . normally , one or two is sufficient .
angle @-@ ampl@@ itu@@ des &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles produce a long run@@ time . thus , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs .
integral stri@@ de length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de width in pixels . you should set the value less than 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never exceed 2 .
use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you receive by selecting this option is only minor , but it doubles the run@@ time . we recommend it to skip it .
the saving and loading buttons are exactly this . correct any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and then rel@@ o@@ aded .
correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take very long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Canc@@ el .
below you can see how image errors with small art@@ ef@@ acts removed . the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a strange black arti@@ fact in the foreground that caused by a poor film shift during the journey . the original picture is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ tis@@ ation ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to decrease image noise . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stains and other art@@ ef@@ acts , e.g. from dust or hairs on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub @-@ window details and the sub @-@ window Advanced Settings can stay with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) which is used for the filter . large values increase the time required by the filter per pixel and can blu@@ r the image . the area indicated by the radius is smoo@@ thed over the image and the color in it is smoo@@ thed and thus smaller bugs fixed .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel pitch from the filter forward to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , you may need to re @-@ adjust the edges filter if you change this setting . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter can no longer be maintained and noise or lubric@@ ating occurs again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong it cannot be removed all the noise or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG @-@ art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we advise you to change colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend alter@@ ing color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ em@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas , which are typically used more strongly . however , it also mer@@ ges the shadow areas .
damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of the phase damp@@ ing . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear smoo@@ ther if it can be too high . if it is on its minimum , noise and phase j@@ itter can occur on the edges .
save and load : these buttons are used exactly for that . all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be saved to the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction has been applied to the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too sn@@ app@@ y for your purpose . fortunately , the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use tool to sof@@ ten with the menu entry Con@@ duc@@ ting sof@@ ten@@ ers and experiment with smoo@@ thing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo arti@@ facts .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film grain , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that appear in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images .
the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
reduce JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts : JPEG compression is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm , it generates some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ ef@@ acts ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the saving and loading buttons are exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and then re@@ charged .
photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take very long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish .
the module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera to an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example for photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures were reduced to an old color photo that was read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts that were caused by sc@@ anners and photo paper . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ tis@@ ation ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows hot@@ pixel of photos that were shot with a CCD camera gem , eight have to be removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ PI@@ xi project , which are protected by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in repression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ picture sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual way to select the bad pixels .
load this file into the wizard with the button dark@@ en . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these will be highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark image directly in the connection to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the right dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels .
the image area and preview will help you correct the results within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are lifted out in all preview areas .
select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and see the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
average : an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square turns ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is shown below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ tis@@ ation ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image .
wide @-@ angle lenses , especially the medium and large photo format , cannot illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area evenly . instead , &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ ent@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior .
but it also has cons . many center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aper@@ ture filter , which makes it impossible to hold the camera manually . wide @-@ angle lenses should , also with center filters , use an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise un@@ sharpen@@ ing effects arise through movement .
with the large exposure ranges of today &apos;s fil@@ men@@ and the color or gre@@ y@@ scale depth of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ Filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image that was made without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting Cor@@ rection turns the transformation with a C@@ enter@@ Filter on a picture . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
with three regul@@ ators , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting Cor@@ rection filter and with three further the exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity damp@@ ing at the point of the highest density filter . the standard density is 2.0 , meaning an optical filter with aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or by chance of a light intensity of 2 , . increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting , reduce it by a small degree .
light intensity , contrast and g@@ amma setting : editing an image with the Vig@@ net@@ ting Cor@@ rection reduces the lumin@@ ance of pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide positive values as you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fin@@ er read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment of the target image , let the values for lumin@@ ance / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ code ; image processing from the color gra@@ dation menu .
the original image ( 1 ) shows the Vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a Leu@@ ch@@ amp and contrast correction was also performed in the image with this tool .
the digi@@ tis@@ ation ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . colour@@ less distortion can &apos;t be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree covers the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third grain has a similar round effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s at the edges . this correction is not applied in the mold .
if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated .
in general : this value controls the strength of distortion 2nd degree . with negative values , barrel distortion can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion part . this value appears more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner parameter has the inver@@ ted acci@@ dent@@ als of the Paramet@@ ers General .
zoom : this scale res@@ izes the image size and results in correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive image decreases .
bri@@ gh@@ ten up : this value adju@@ sts brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase them .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a Pre@@ view shows the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start .
the correction should be performed prior to any cutting or size changes . it is best to perform this correction first of all . if you want to re @-@ cut an image and then perform a ton@@ ne correction , the effect would be apparent to the wrong one .
to help you find the best correc@@ tions , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal support line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to show the dotted lines . move it to an important location , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the ton@@ ne / cushion distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them with the cutting tool in the transformation process , or via the Zoom knob of this dialog .
the next logical step for some subjects such as shots from front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with the hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the ton@@ ne correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simulate inf@@ ra @-@ red film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org web site that is reachable under this URL . the filter produces the known IL@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ rar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview , you can set two parameters to adjust film and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . turn on the Inclu@@ de Film Cap@@ ture option if you want to simulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO control changes the amount of film grain and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) . green meadows are white like snow !
because the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared films , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos because the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the trot@@ ter .
the &amp; digi@@ code filter is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film images on your pictures . this is known from classical high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers mix large silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film @-@ gra@@ ding effect gives your photo a certain mood or appears to shift back into the past . the treated picture gets rid of a timeless ambi@@ ance from everyday life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , road @-@ photographic , gra@@ iny appearance especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you must use this filter .
the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , set to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film @-@ gra@@ ined effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
digi@@ tis@@ ation ; Filter oil paintings give your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . natural images and still life are good for this effect .
there are two controls to influence this effect . the top sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large images . smoo@@ thing controls the smoo@@ ths or , viewed from the other side , the sharp@@ ness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the processor is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel size is 1 and smoo@@ thed 17 .
the digi@@ tis@@ ation ; Filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dient to create a carbon@@ ic sketch . the lines that outline the outlines in the drawing are emphasized . images whose gra@@ dients will slowly change are therefore not ideal for this effect .
there are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper controller sel@@ ects the pen size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smoo@@ thing ) .
this is an example of the coal drawing filter . the original picture ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; Filter engra@@ ver shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; Filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , where color is not the most important element . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ ochro@@ me landscape .
depth allows adjusting the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , equivalent to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the finished image ( 2 ) . the depth used is 10 % .
with this filter group , you can transform a normal photograph into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and lets it look as if it is viewed through glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog to the wave blocks 1 , the image is distorted with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Finish .
with this filter group , you can transform a normal photograph into a work of art using blu@@ r effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ sharp@@ ness : bl@@ urs the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from one center . this simul@@ ates the blu@@ r a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al blu@@ r : bl@@ urred the image by turning the pixels around a center point . this simul@@ ates the blu@@ r of a rotating camera .
sharp@@ ness : bl@@ urred the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to be back in the background .
motion blu@@ r : wi@@ pes the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blu@@ r of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train taking photos , camera .
soft drawing : bl@@ urs the image sof@@ tly in the dark and strongly in the light tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and gle@@ aming soft focus effect ( Hamilton Eff@@ ect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
shaking : bl@@ urs the image by shifting the pixels by random shifting and thus simul@@ ates the blu@@ r of an arbitrary moving camera .
smart bl@@ ur@@ ring : finds the bas@@ ins in the picture and bl@@ urs them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it , by filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time using the button Finish .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops into your picture . this makes it natural to your pictures a wet appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n &apos;s copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm .
drop size allows to change the size of drops . as the drop@@ let size does not automatically increase with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes changes the optical effect of the drops on the image .
you can keep an area free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you start the filter reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops .
this is an example of the reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the illustrated picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mirr@@ oring or turning in the correct orientation . you can find the tools in the transformation Tur@@ ning or Trans@@ forming .
photo blowing is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is , how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into an image when the boundaries of resolution are reached ? how can you re@@ inv@@ ent or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm that is used here makes a good job . try it and you &apos;ll see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select to change size in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog can be seen below .
the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality then try the tool to infl@@ ate .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation for enlar@@ ging an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS labs in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the New size tab and are listed below :
maintain aspect ratio : when this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , because it is difficult to set the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
the Save As and Char@@ ging buttons are used precisely for this purpose . each st@@ all@@ u@@ rement for photo magni@@ fication can be saved as a text file and then re@@ charged .
the photo is very fast with what it does , but it can still last very long and take a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish .
you can see below an example for photo bubbles by enlar@@ ging a small image on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magni@@ fication .
cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . to cut a photo you just have to create with the mouse just the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and raising the rect@@ angle . you will see this rect@@ angle then while you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse button , the area of the photo will be cut away . you can change the size of the area to be cut by dra@@ gging at the corners of the rect@@ angle . create a new rect@@ angle by simply clicking with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The cutting knob of image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut to size ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) .
in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by dra@@ gging the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog remains intact .
depending on the aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as a portrait or a landscape format . in portrait format , the higher value of the height and the cross @-@ format width is always assigned .
trimm@@ ing After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches , inches or any other physical size . you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically .
at the bottom of the dialog , you can set the area for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
when you use the trimm@@ ing tool next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image .
the settings of the integration help enable you to hide help so that you can better assemble your images . these aids are :
harmonious triangle : harmonic divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . as the third @-@ third rule , harmonious tri@@ angles are a way to divide a rect@@ angle into similarly harmonious tri@@ angles at the diag@@ onal .
golden middle : the golden centre is a division that affects various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden pitch at all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious .
the golden center provides more fluid relief lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
the golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos . in comparison to the third rule , the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this kind of composition leads the viewer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow .
one more rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spir@@ als , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . this rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . it should be something that the eye falls into the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the Golden Tri@@ angles are also derived from the golden spiral above . their verti@@ ces are the center points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ on@@ als to place these lines can have a static object more dynamic .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your image focus at one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t achieve otherwise .
the options horizontal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic divi@@ dings .
with the button Color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the auxiliary lines can become invisible . in this way , you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
when you make a photo , it happens easily that you do not hold the camera vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle . you can do this with the &amp; digi@@ code ; image processing and tool free rotation .
rotate your picture with slide angle . the values on this slide are specified in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button , you can set the slider back to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image will be shown at the top right .
for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the picture , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you have turned a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the function Trans@@ forming trimm@@ ing from image processing .
an elegant way to cut the picture is the automatic cutting . select one of the following options :
the Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing option smoo@@ thes the picture a bit after rotation . note however the above warning .
all perspective transform@@ ations are performed by a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically calculated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty spaces created by the transformation in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty spaces created by the transformation , in pixels .
corner left above : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
corner right above : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : shows the current angle in degrees in the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right below : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image is s@@ me@@ ared a little . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments create a dou@@ bly strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers trimm@@ ing from the image processing .
this is not a rotation , the image is distorted . in other words , a rect@@ angle turns into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via transform@@ ers .
you can shoot horizont@@ ally and vertically at the same time . if you press preview , the angles will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed to the right of the preview area .
for your help , a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed . move the mouse to an important point , like the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image .
after you &apos;ve done the sc@@ aling , the picture gets bl@@ urred . for a single sc@@ aling , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two ch@@ ings produce twice as much bl@@ ur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after the sc@@ aling , the picture has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers trimm@@ ing from the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ code ; needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write picture formats . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam .
because of this depen@@ dency from other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system at this point . however , you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF below .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; displays only files in formats that are familiar with . this is done using the file extension and a comparison of those with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , the file will be digi@@ ti@@ zed ; you can change this list of file extensions .
nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the use of data compression processes on digital images . in doing so , redundant information is reduced in order to save the image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG in the same compression ratio .
if you want to learn more about the tube format , you can read in English on Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful guides in English . you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TI@@ FF by &amp; digi@@ kam . in the configuration section , you can find further information about using modules with &amp; digi@@ kam .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ kam . this supports more than 200 raw file formats . all support cameras can be seen at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that are supported by &amp; digi@@ kam .
many digital cameras support recording short films . these clips are often recorded in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam ; but is not a film editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in options to view or edit movies . when you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ code ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playing movies use to start the program for playback .
go forward to the previously visited record in the Chron@@ icle . you can only go for@@ wards when you have gone back .

if you change steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast is already very good , then you can do the first four adjustment with the module white balance .
many tools you need to do photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ code ; included . your description will follow here .
all image editing tools like sharpen@@ ing , soft@@ ness , noise reduction , re@@ focused , non @-@ sharp mask , &amp; etc ; . use a common dialog box indicating the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current picture . below you will see &amp; quot ; texture authenti@@ cated ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current picture . to the left of it , five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
the left section shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected preview range .
horizont@@ ally , without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper part shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview range .
the left section shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper part shows the original and the lower one shows the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch on to show over@@ exposure and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adapted to the general setup page .
( 3 ) : the frame for selecting the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to see the preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the Properties page displays the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo Features : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data are from EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map finder tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can move in or out with the mouse wheel or drag it . move it while you press the left mouse button . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to pull a square . of course , all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and select colors .
the pallets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can apply either to the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal Fol@@ der for &amp; K@@ de ; Settings and hot Custom Color and Rec@@ ently used colors .
in the Di@@ alogue palette , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders for files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed in the pallet view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
the color is described below the palette view . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used to select . to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor to there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box Bei@@ m cur@@ sor is activated under the button color , the color is inserted from the color panel at the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ write another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ writing is selected .
a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions to copy , cut and paste .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data stored in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line character , if there is another color . so if there are three numbers in the cli@@ p@@ board , they can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; inserted .
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color selection on the left .
&amp; k@@ graphi@@ vi@@ z ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; Graph@@ s ; graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there has not been a modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs that &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are according to the program author obsol@@ ete &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graphi@@ vi@@ z ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; Graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphi@@ vi@@ z ; displays graph@@ ene with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; cate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( such that a change in the graph in &amp; kate ; re@@ inv@@ ents the graph and in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; kate ; to open or to open the graph in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; in a &amp; kate ; component
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems around 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to show more than these k@@ not )
further required software : &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program which requires the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs . in detail :
the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; without any argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar will only open the symbol file and open the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog File .
after selecting one or more &amp; dot ; files , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can choose a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( up and down without special buttons , left and right with pressed &amp; alt ; key ) ;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by the factor 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the currently loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will appear :
you can choose if the graph is to be rel@@ o@@ aded or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; can also note your decision , so that it will proceed as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can set up the menu item Settings k@@ graphi@@ cally ; see also .
if you want to open a graph@@ ite file outside an ongoing &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally instance , eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally instance , or want to display the graph to be loaded in a sub @-@ window of the current instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog .
at program start you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both save as well as later .
you can also specify how to split the graph to multiple pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page are to be fitted to this page . in doing so , the aspect ratio will be ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph .
page preview with a graph distributed on several pages without head@@ line and with another font
the Renew@@ able Store page gives the possibility to specify the behavior when a file has been modified to the hard drive , and eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or let the program prompt for each time .
the opening page gives the ability to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; specify a standard behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub @-@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is asked .
the session administration page gives the possibility to specify the starting behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; you can specify a default behavior ( open the files of the last session or not ) or decide to be asked afterwards at each start .
the context menu , which usually appears at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ M@@ B@@ n ; opens up more possibilities :
here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the web site of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z , are :
the algorithm sets the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short as possible edges and as few edge overl@@ app@@ ings as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for non @-@ generating graphs . it produces representations in accordance with the spring@@ board model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a spring @-@ spring model for un@@ developed graphs . it uses the Fru@@ tigen @-@ Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ purpose sol@@ ver for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the no@@ des in a circle according to the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for specific diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
open a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which will then be executed by a shell . with such a layout command , you can use &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithms to give special options , or modify the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
speci@@ fies the type of graph ( directional or executed ) and uses the default algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ modified graphs ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
displays the What is the mouse cur@@ sor . click on a &amp; GUI ; element to get more help on this element ( if any ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the base folder of the source repository .
&amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools for displaying . it requires the following program packages :
a special setup is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; in the Settings menu , you will find further options .
the main window of the icon editor is divided into five sections : the main tool@@ bar , the bar for drawing tools , the status bar , the color palette and the grid where you sign the symbol .
create a new icon . if the current file has been changed , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save the changes . after that , a dialog appears where you can choose whether the symbol should be created from a template , or whether you want to restart from scratch .
restore the last step back . if you do not have a step back , this feature is disabled .
inserts the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current symbol in gray scale . this can create colors that do not match those of the symbol palette of gray .

the K@@ IP@@ I module provides tools to read and store new images .
this module can be used to read and store new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the San@@ e project or another source such as video streams . to enable this to work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you open the menu item pictures , a dialog appears , which allows you to select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to get the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears to replace your own image in order to select your image accordingly . see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you start scanning the image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information .
make sure the window is fully displayed , as some settings may not be displayed .
after pressing the button Scan , you have to wait until the scan is complete and the window for setting the options of the target image appears . please remember that the BM@@ P type does not comp@@ ress and therefore creates very large files . you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; or create by saving the image .
you can create screen@@ shots after selecting the menu Im@@ por@@ ta@@ - &gt; Screen @-@ Photo ... a window appears in which you can set the different screen modes :
select The Complete Desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
when all your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , read the currently visible work@@ station . if you choose to read the complete desktop , only the window will be read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long the screen shot is waiting before it starts . if you need to switch to other working areas , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there .
after the screen shot has been created , the dialog box options appear with the options described above .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Calendar currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing it , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. At@@ tention : the participants of this list speak English .

the module Export to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
when using the module for the first time , you are guided by the process of generating a token , so it is used for your authentication . so , it is your reference to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so that you can log in at Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after successfully logging in , you can send the module photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r website . you will be shown the following page after a successful login .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you click Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
when the ex@@ porting module is started on Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be welcomed with the following dialog , which displays the current access rights that the module displays . to upload , you need write per@@ missions . the module currently supports no other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions .
the button photos should be pressed once you set all the other options . with this button , you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . when you press the O@@ k button , you can upload the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r Server .
the keywords field can be filled with a comm@@ a separated list of words . these are added to the image as key words during upload .
with the options Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie , you can set the per@@ missions to your images . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you choose to change the size of the photos before upload , the photos are changed before upload to size . the size is taken from the value entered at maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed in such a way that the aspect ratio stays constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module @-@ Export module is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server .
the K@@ IP@@ I gallery @-@ export module currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing it , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. At@@ tention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows you to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF key of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization provides tools to locate images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and lati@@ tude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ p can download the data for you from your GPS device and convert .
image Ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization correlation . this interface can bring together a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears then . to perform a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data recorded at the same locations as the images of your camera .
if the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed that shows the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone .
the adjustment for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper vari@@ ance for the GPS time and camera time . if the devi@@ ation is below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have a track data from one place for images , you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ing and difference in minutes can be used if you have no matching data . if you know that in reality a location is in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a series of photos at the same location . as the dialogue takes the coordinates of a call to the next , you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set using the displayed map . select the region in question and increase si@@ e.@@ At@@ tend this over and over again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the card can be changed between map mode , satellite image and mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ tool to provide a pile of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I Picture Gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums to a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is en@@ coded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to allow the best possible internation@@ alization .
the panel selection allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below will display the Al@@ ben@@ Pre@@ view and the text that will appear in the header of the HTML page .
the tab displays the general look and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you then click on a picture , a new page opens in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , displayed
the Ri@@ der Album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your images . choose a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Ex , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you choose the JPEG file format , EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images .
you can change the default color depth with other color depth . of course , this also affects the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the rider thumb@@ nails will allow you to adjust some of the settings from the Album Ri@@ der for thumb@@ nails , these are small images displayed in the gallery .
a progress window displays the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not automatically be closed . therefore , you can read the program messages to see if errors occurred during the production process .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool for viewing images .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as turning , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons . it was developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is shown in full screen mode by default . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of los@@ s@@ less storage is that the file size is increasing because no compression of the color information takes place . this can be found e.g. in the P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I Digital Camera Cli@@ ent is a tool for you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing it , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. At@@ tention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import function of the metadata module you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the metadata .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere but do not write in any format . JPEG is supported when writing . please check out ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck . you can also add a basic image transition between the individual images . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV file .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the chosen video format . in addition , you can choose a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD formats for your DVD player . finally , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you first need to select the images to be packed into the MPEG slideshow . after that , you can create the module by extras MPEG slide show .
the images selected by you are then listed under image files in the Portfolio . there you can also change the images or the content of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning to return the file on a TV , you must select the appropriate TV Standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds which will display a picture . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high , very smooth picture change .
the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should leave it black . you can set the name and path of the generated file with the name of the MPEG output file . keep the ending mp@@ g as possible .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . once you have adapted all settings to your needs , you can start the production of the movie using the coding button . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now enjoy a coffee or enjoy the slide show if you are back .
if a note appears that short@@ cuts or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages using the button settings to the right below .
the print assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the Gim@@ p image processing .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import and convert your images stored in RA@@ W format to one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quotation from Him is : do not expect d@@ cra@@ w to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer .
first select the RA@@ W file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image . with the button Pre@@ view you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance . the essential parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
tagged Image Format , TI@@ FF , keeps all information from your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you intend to edit your images frequently or later use them elsewhere , you should not choose the JPEG format since it only allows a limited number of operations before image quality is deterior@@ ated . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is included in the RA@@ W file is stored in the JPEG file in the ex@@ if information .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el .
batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . therefore , if you are secure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , they have the possibility to over@@ ride existing file automatically . this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all pictures of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , starting number and tim@@ est@@ amp .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can reduce or increase the image . in addition , four types of image changes are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : change of size in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format .
not Pro@@ por@@ tional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
printing preparation : prepares the image for the photo print . the user can adjust the printing resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target picture , including background size , edge size and background color , will be adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
after you have started the module , the pictures window will be displayed with the images you have selected . you can add more pictures with a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview of the right @-@ hand side will be displayed .
you can also drag images onto the picture list and place it there to add you to the list of images to be sent .
with the button images remove the selected pictures from the list of images to be sent .
after selecting all the images you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client using the OK button . you only need to add the addresses and the subject . the images selected by you are attached as attachments .
pay attention not to send too many images at once . most email accounts have limitations on the size of emails to be sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending images . your configuration is saved and used every time you change it .
select your mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you will need to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ Mail@@ Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments to the images are added to a text file and attached to the mail .
the P@@ NG format under the Menu image file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best suited to los@@ s@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . therefore , you should use P@@ NG if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend you the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG image file format and the original files are in JPEG format , the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ information will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not automatically shut down so that you can see the status messages , in search of errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end .
after starting the Advanced Di@@ ash@@ au module , a window appears with questions like you want to show your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the option Open@@ GL transitions in the presentation will enable very elegant image transitions by Open@@ GL . however , you have to have a corresponding graphics card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; File name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; option ensures that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an infinite loop . you can then manually ab@@ ort it with Es@@ c .
the option pictures random@@ ly select ensures that the images are displayed in a random order . so , it is not used to order the images in the album .
the time distance between the images can be set between the images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds are 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so you should test this before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select . random@@ ly select another effect at any transition between the images .
during the slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on you .
with this tool@@ bar , you can pause and restart the presentation , jump to the previous and next image and stop the slide show .
on the left lower edge of the screen you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date has currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing it , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. At@@ tention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the desktop .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as a background for your K@@ DE desktop .
once you have ann@@ ot@@ ated your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can go with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; browse through these , see picture . as you can see by comparing them with the picture , there are entries in each group , i.e. in people , places and in group keywords .
in the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in addition , there are records to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current preview images . in the following , each one is described .
when you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see image .
if you select another person , only the images are shown on which both persons are visible . by this selection method , you can limit the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few individual images .
if you have selected all the people , locations and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your sphere of action .
in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however for each person to store your own preview , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself .
in order to display images next to the names , select the button located on the right outside of the tool@@ bar . in the pop @-@ up context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of people and a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have any suitable images for your keywords ) .
in order to do this , you will need to open the picture @-@ view window ( in more detail ) and select the category editor in the context menu . here you can adjust the picture for the appropriate person . in the view window you can adjust the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image to be displayed or cut off .
when you search the search entry in the main window , a dialog appears , which is very similar to the dialog for setting the picture properties . you can view this dialog again on the picture .
if you enter a string in the cap@@ tion or description field , the cap@@ tions and descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also specify a date to search for ; the date can either be part of the total date , i.e. for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use an area of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all images by specific names as you can see in the picture . here is shown in pictures where Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather want to try the same features , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the website of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo if you want to start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; demo . as a result , some sample images will be loaded and you can try the features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the website of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this list shows you date statistics about the images in your database .
you can switch between units years , months , weeks , hours , and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively for the following ways : you can change the displayed preview view from the database ( when you select a date , the first image will be displayed in the preview window ) and the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview window .
you can also select an area of the tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button down and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time values . if you select an area , preview only pictures of this time period . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you two options to create HTML websites with your images . one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can create via the menu File HTML ...
before creating HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas Content , Layout and Obj@@ ectives . in the following , each area is described more accurately .
first , enter the title of the overview and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML sample pages see an example of these settings .
next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file should be created to be seen on the overview page .
finally , you can choose which information to display on the HTML pages . for example , you can avoid that information is displayed without a description . for example , that all images are from a party . for example , that all images are from a party . therefore , you cannot use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this area , you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why this is not specifically addressed .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . thus , those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 cannot download any images , for example , a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you set . so , he can browse your images with low resolution , leading to a lower transmission time . if he wants to get an image larger , he changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting range , specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored .
best select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first , select the main folder where all your images will be saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added next time . this allows you to select either a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example :
once you have created your images , you can check if they are all visible to the viewer . if you choose a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages are created should be started . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not in the final destination folder , you must manually copy them there . so that the import function , see , correctly you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the configuration options described above have all three to base folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name you specify in output folders .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you may , of course , create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . however , if you have spent a lot of time using the image information , people on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you must go with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not even do this work again .
with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album , you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import them to your database .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are saved with the file or if there is only one link to the file in the file . the advantage of saving all images in the file is that you have all the pictures together and pass this file so independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the File Export menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file looks for the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are found in the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export .
the following is a dialog for ex@@ porting images , which you can access via the Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
when you manually copy the manual to the .@@ k@@ im file , copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
copying the Automati@@ cally option to the .@@ k@@ im file copied &amp; photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zi@@ p files . since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files .
the last option of this page is to limit maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you may not want to send the images in full size , since the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
when you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the Import menu ... select , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; import the exported database as described in .
the im@@ porting wizard consists of four steps . first , you must select which images you want to import , then in which folders the import images should be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category persons of the file to be imported ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) while this category is in your database people . therefore , in the third dialog window , you will be asked what categories of imported file should be imported and what categories they are in your database .
in the fourth step , you can offset the categories of file to be imported with the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen in the image .
it must be easy to browse and view images : if you see pictures , you often want to jump inside different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; for example , if you look at pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual you will pass through the various steps of ( 1 ) determining the information about your images , via ( 2 ) the browsing and pres@@ tige , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program to manage your images . it has been expanded and today it also cares for your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often this includes videos .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file in the top folder of their images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal Backup Tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in CVS , where you want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; records the folder in which your images are saved and will use it automatically in future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . for example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / Images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
over the menu entry settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... go to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual you will be explained the different settings options .
on the left you can see six different icons with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting a detailed help is available , which you can access by pressing a button on the F1 key and clicking on the desired option .
it describes how you can set different properties for each image , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups , such as objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog that is used to edit existing groups . for each group you can select an inscription and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in Di@@ alogue Options , you can set up entire member groups , i.e. all members of a group at a time in a group , rather than all groups of a member as explained in .
in the list below you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; divi@@ des its modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ kam and g@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface .
the modules can be called via the menu module . the modules can and will not be described in this manual since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself .
since the modules of several applications are shared among each other , it may be that the modules have been tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this is why you should always test new modules with the demo database before you apply them to your own images .
the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications record their images in albums : an album is simply a folder . even though &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates the order for albums so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
this is the current album that is just the current view , so all images that show you the picture preview right now .
in addition to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have a list of albums . here goes &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the contents of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you set in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so if you use the category persons , for example , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do so , so if you have selected people to view and pass them on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the Settings dialog and select modules to load modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a starting screen as soon as you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used to any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top . under the tool@@ bar you will see the window with which you can browse your image database . in the section we will return to this window , but now click on the entry images to show you an overview of all existing images .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this includes information about the people shown on the picture , where the picture was taken , etc . you can set each image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if , for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is shown and all images were taken in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these notes when using the built @-@ in viewer .
see three lists with a text field by setting people , locations and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you will always use them again when you type information about your images .
the following idea is based on moving images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration , and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are shown , you can , so that the names used are moved upwards , the persons can find and assign them faster .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click the symbol for sorting by date below the list .
if you have selected ann@@ ot@@ ations for each image individually , you may want to edit all selected pictures and add these images with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case , simply click on the buttons before and back , which are located under the thumb@@ nail of the image to the right .
if you have recorded several images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to select all these pictures and to use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California .
in the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as an over@@ board . to show you that it is an over@@ board , a special icon is displayed .
in the context menu of the note dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new category or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also simply drag an entry into a category and put it there to make it an sub @-@ category of this entry .
you can move the individual elements of the note dialog by clicking and post@@ p@@ one the box that form the upper edge of the frame . you can also make a separate window from a frame by dra@@ gging it outside the window pane .
if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs , that you are happy with the settings , click the Options ... , which offers you among other things the possibility to save the current layout and appearance of the window .
you can also completely fade out a frame . if you want to get this window displayed later , use the Options ... and then hide / hide windows here . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the images displayed in the browser , you will get an overview of thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or all images if you have no filter . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button . just try it .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this will be displayed in the picture viewer . if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the Del@@ ete key or select Edit Sel@@ ection in the Edit menu . now , you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you may have saved the images anywhere , with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can record the images anywhere , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive .
pictures in which the right upper corner is cut is not stored on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 the thumb@@ nails are present , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also view these images with the image viewer .
as you can see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them back into . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not support it until now to ask for the inser@@ tion of your images . so if you want to avoid trouble on how to mess up your images , please purchase a larger hard drive to store all images on it .
in the menu images you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name Privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the images in such a way that at the end those you want to make for others un@@ available and click Current View in the Privacy menu .
with this you set the images to be hidden in case of the case . if you give your laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry images , so all the images you have locked can be hidden . if you want to get the images displayed again , click on lock .
it is also possible to set a password which must be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select the password in the privacy menu .
please keep in mind that this image protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , all pictures on the hard drive and on the other can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text .
the reason why you all have your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours of hours with it is natural that you want to look at them some@@ day . for this reason &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; on a picture _ and video viewer . you can start from the preview as described in .
you can see the viewer in . of course , it shows the image , but additional all the information you have to enter via the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc .
if the info box on top of the picture you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and put it elsewhere . you can also configure what information is displayed and if any information is available at all . all of these options are available right @-@ click on the viewer .
if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have multiple images loaded in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and image . you can jump to the first and last image with Post@@ 1 and End . these functions are also accessible from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus .
a very useful ability of the viewer of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . just use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you are using the viewer you can move in and zoom into the image . to zoom out , you can just drag a rect@@ angle with the mouse . the minus key zo@@ oms in the center of the picture . shows how a zoom angle is selected and shows the results of the zo@@ oms .
with the point button , you can reset your zoom so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the Sync button sets the zo@@ oms , so each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work in videos will work in and zoom out with the plus and minus key .
with the turning functions from the context menu , you can rotate the picture . this does not work for videos . you can make notes on the current picture with the menu item notes from the context menu .
when you look at images it can happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten to put on the picture . at the moment you can preview the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you may prefer to mark the image and look at more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the images and mark them as good or bad while you watch one after the other .
for the two examples above , the viewer can provide images with features while viewing them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking the corresponding letter . see a picture in which the characters A , B and C are set .
as soon as you have set features on your images , they are available in your browser . so if you have any images you can edit , print or whatever you have selected , simply add all the images you need . then you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view . if you can view the categories in dre Pre@@ view view , you can add features to the pictures by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you will be allowed to paint on the picture .
the batch is not saved with the image but in the database . in this way you can undo your painted later .
in order to complete the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; switch on the image from the context menu . to finish the painting , just press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to master the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not complete , but the documentation too &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you have read and understood .
in the object tree , you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in object properties and the object displayed in the wi@@ re@@ model views .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , since all objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the location where you want to insert the object and either click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu item in the In@@ sert menu .
if there are multiple possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed so that you can choose the right position :
del@@ eting either from the menu bar , under Edit or from the right @-@ click context menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene previously .
if you have changed properties , click Apply to take these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message with a fault description will be displayed . then you can correct the input errors and click Apply again or disc@@ ard the changes .
if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; - User documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can view a preview of the properties view .
press preview in the properties view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , check local .
the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these check@@ points with the mouse button , thus changing the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross appears in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse inside the entire window .
each object has a visibility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the visibility level of the higher @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only when they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility stage selected in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window order or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it arbitr@@ arily . you can also save several window arrangements and simply switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window above or below a present view , pull the an@@ f@@ itter to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then displays the new position .
to create a new column , drag the gra@@ dient to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other , pull the p@@ asser in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking the tab at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement is floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . in order to fix a view from anch@@ oring , pull the an@@ vil on the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left in the cham@@ ois bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the cham@@ fer@@ ing bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any point .
you can save the current window view with View window order ... Save a dialog where you can save the window order under an existing or new name .
if you created a scene , you can render it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to render , this program must be properly installed . when this manual was written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 current . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 .
to render the current scene , click the Ren@@ dering icon in the tool@@ bar or select the menu item View scene .
a render mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and the quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many render @-@ modes as you like , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or in the View R@@ ender modes menu , the following dialog will be opened :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense a name that lets you recognize the characteristics of the mode .
in the size of the map size , you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the picture , select the check box below and enter the image section for rendering into the input fields .
in combination field quality , you can choose the properties that use &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used for rendering . this is done by a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ user reflection lighting .
when a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel , various errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or stepped effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better .
if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of the super @-@ sampling . as standard an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling incorporates the adjacent pixels with it . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is continuously split and adaptive because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4 additional points will be calculated for a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are individually monitored and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value .
another possibility to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn on j@@ itter@@ ing , change &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the final setting for the quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; which calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light reflection . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this feature .
on this map you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . then a pixel is transparent when the associated rays have no object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expectedly quit , you can find the reason for it here .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; scene import , select File Im@@ porting ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supported &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full command range of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; if error messages or warnings occur when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog box displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import , write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Begin and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object to the opened text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with Cop@@ y and Pa@@ ste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can add source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on Help in the Property View , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; User Docum@@ entation to the displayed object . here the path to your retention and the version . supported are versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example , height field data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used to display the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the view field in the camera view and in the window type number plate .
you can set the object catch of points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and turns .
larger values result in a more precise wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the detail level separately for two directions .
when you tick High Detailed Lo@@ fi@@ del@@ ity for advanced projection , all wire model views are further divided , if the camera uses an extended projection . advanced Proj@@ ections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections . this feature gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time to render .
when you tick the wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is represented in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you tick the floor , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors .
if you tick the edge smoo@@ thing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can adjust the values for depth and threshold value .
on this page you can change existing window arrangements or create new window orders . in the window classi@@ fications section explains how to create and save window arrangements .
the drop @-@ down sel@@ ector standard window arrangement : shows all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the existing window arrangements display all existing window orders . a new arrangement can be created with the addition button and del@@ eting a selected arrangement with the button Del@@ ete .
each window order is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all views for the selected window order . new views can be created with the addition button and del@@ eting selected views with the button Del@@ ete .
the new column will create a new column on the right @-@ hand side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten anchor the window under the existing window , with tab , you get a map view together with the previous view and ho@@ vering the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without a more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , very popular among beginners : a sphere on a level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen . if you are using a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied for rendering , as a result you get a black image .
if you do not insert any light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture .
if you have installed all error @-@ free , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window order :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing tool@@ bars . please read the documentation so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you first have to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Del@@ ete . so you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene you create . in particular , you will notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the term camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera are found . in the user documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; see for more details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera has control points in the view that you can change the focus point of the camera . simply click on a control point and drag it to the desired location .
if you press the application button or the input button , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see here the scene from the point of view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you could insert a straight ( insert fin@@ ite body Qu@@ ader ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a complicated method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as ground :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and press the Apply button or enter the input button . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wi@@ re@@ top view now also displays the level , although at the moment only as a limited infinite plane . when you render the scene , the plane extends up to the horizon .
when you look at the object tree , you will find that you can fold the item for the bottom by clicking on the + in front of the object . in this case you will only see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shifting .
in this scene , you should move the floor to the exercise unit under the horizon line , only in order to get to know some of these parameters . choose shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment select something simple .
in both cases , a dialog opens in which you can select how to insert the object . please choose first object . the pigment is then displayed in the property view ( name = ground @-@ pigment ) , with a click on the button preview , see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the preview of the pigment is just a matt black material , because you still need to re @-@ enter the pig@@ ments . just remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time by clicking on the thumb@@ nail .
if you do not see a color on the header and the ball in the preview , just click the Apply button and then preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color you expected . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more often , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , choose one color each time and change the colors in the view of the properties :
you should be able to do this step by simply because you have already understood the basic behavior of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be just as simple as the floor :
in the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget to press the input button or the button Apply ) , so the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground as you have moved the bottom around one unit down@@ wards .
naturally , the rendering now results in a strange result : as already before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . in the following step , set a suitable material .
when you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already on the ground , give the ball a pigment as a color :
select first object and change the name for example in sphere pigment . click on sphere pigment , then select In@@ coloured and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects when you take the time to adjust some finishing properties :
then change the values as in the following screen shots and click Apply or press the input button .
the settings gloss effect and reflection already result in good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal : not yet selected :
you should now have a good idea of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er offers ; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ ing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the render will shoot hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you don &apos;t see anything , the image is just black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file that you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file is inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be saved on the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and memory space .
restore the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are disc@@ arded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit Un@@ do .
save the current window order and open a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ ride an existing configuration .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , short@@ cut and default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . with this option you can add pre @-@ set short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
a dump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a dump map as well as a texture map .
basic shapes are simple geometric shapes you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are made of dozens or even hundreds of these basic shapes . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on a pixel basis by using an image file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing .
images can be shown either in a window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; cu@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files you can use by clicking the &amp; L@@ M@@ B@@ n ; or the return key .
you can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the file name in the browser window . then a small input box appears in the lower right corner . when a matching file name is found , the file will be highlighted . you can exit the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c ;
in the Con@@ figuration - &amp; cu@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , General and Edi@@ ting and Sli@@ deshow , you can set the working method of &amp; cu@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the other two , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts can be set for each window .
if this is selected , the images are opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color , which you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
this point is activated , loads &amp; cu@@ ck@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still look at the current picture . this reduces the delay if you choose the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show .
this option stores &amp; cu@@ ck@@ show ; when termin@@ ating the name of the last opened folder . at the next start , &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bars to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the picture , the background will also be filled with the selected color .
you can set up &amp; cu@@ ck@@ show ; set up that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program .
with this option , the display window is enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
specify whether the slideshow will begin with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field , or use the scroll bar or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field , or use the scroll bar or the small arrows to the right next to the input field .
change the key short@@ cuts for the different operating modes of &amp; cu@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small symbols for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
shows thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
decreases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
enlar@@ ges the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the images . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is open .
displaying the image in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it is selected .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing . &amp; show@@ foto ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ code ; project .
&amp; show@@ shot ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ foto ; an open source project . this means that the user contributes his part to at least problems and possible improvements .
this shows a dialog with a link . if you are using it , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . all required information is already completed , and you can simply follow the instructions to submit your message .
&amp; show@@ shot ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers are helping each other . if you are a more common user of &amp; show@@ shots ; then we would like to ask you to ask other users of &amp; show@@ shots ; however , in this mailing list English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
the best way to participate in &amp; show@@ shots ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions for joining the developers mailing list of &amp; show@@ shots ; .
&amp; show@@ shot ; tries to give you so much control over his work@@ flows as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ shots ; to access these settings , you need to set up show@@ shots ; the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons on the left .
in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ wise , the colors should be in contrast with what you should show . under@@ exposure should indicate a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ shot ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides you with important information and actions on the selected images . you can also view the same side@@ bar in image editing . you can view these in which you click on one of the five tab@@ s :
&amp; Canon ; is an application to scan images that do not do more than scan and save images .
&amp; channels ; is a simple application for scanning images that no longer does as images to scan and save . &amp; channels ; can open a dialog for saving each image or store the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images before storing them .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this site : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set in the terminal command line ; with the command sc@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner to be used and press OK to open the scanner .
the other settings contain more detailed driver options . &amp; channels ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options very much .
to scan a picture , the user can only start a pre @-@ scan and then scan for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
in order to select the image better , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom so that the complete preview fits into the window .
when the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
when saving a preview in the settings is selected , the image will appear in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and sli@@ pping will result in an abor@@ tion and you will return to the main window .
the Settings button opens the dialog of the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user then the option must be selected .
this setting allows you to select the way you want to save images . open the dialog for each image and open the dialog before each sc@@ anned image . if &amp; channels ; this will automatically save with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must select Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are saved without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder is used as default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change it by clicking ...
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the automatically to save images and is beyond the proposed name for the image in the Save dialog . the automatically stored image receives a num@@ eric suff@@ ix of each time a picture is saved . the # # # character string is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button Help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; gu@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button Via starts the K@@ DE dialog for &amp; channels ; . the button Settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to quit .
&amp; Canon ; licensed under the GP@@ L and licensed under the GP@@ L , under L@@ GP@@ L . caution : lib@@ san@@ e is licensed under the GP@@ L with an exception .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses like all other key short@@ cuts . you can set up a list of this short@@ cuts and their function . the global short@@ cuts can be set by clicking the right mouse button in the player window and set up the global key short@@ cut . click the right mouse button in the player window and select short commands ... select .
you may set up existing multimedia buttons in such a way that they function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ short commands . this makes your keyboard a &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , playlist browsers and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some own command line options .
you should give a feedback to the user if the script can &apos;t be executed because of a missing depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all required modules are present and use the k@@ dialog to make the user know why a script doesn &apos;t work .
begin require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error 37 = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
in the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as a base for your own scripts or simply expand it to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in any K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow the execution of external programs and commands . this mostly uses the ex@@ ec ( ) function . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all current scripts . for this purpose strings are written to the default setting of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore events even if there is no use for it .
configure Wei@@ st the script to display the setup dialog . to store and store the setup data , each script must take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok relies on the folder where all the data should be stored .
track@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is being played . the script could now and z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions you could ask for more information about the new item ( for example , the metadata or the length of the unit ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ izing Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths Con@@ tains the path to the selected playlist files when a custom menu item is cli@@ cked . to add an entry , you can use the d@@ CO@@ P function d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stop , or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M signal to the script . this signal should be processed to perform , for example , clearing up data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , which can optionally also be detected with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the cat@@ abo@@ li@@ script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages right away .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights :
if your script package is ready , you can attach it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to go through endless menus . maybe you are looking for a very specific song from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search , you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which one you want to hear ? then the playlist is just the right thing for you . and if you still have difficulty deciding , dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists will automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used so YOU can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right way to re@@ discover your music !
usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have any trouble with comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options to enable or disable the configure @-@ time point with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the comp@@ iling options certain depen@@ dencies must be met so that they can be used . see the system requirements section for details .
activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; help , you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs through the setup dialog without difficulty . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards for setting up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
in addition to the player window , the player window will also turn on / off the playlist . if the option is off , only the playlist window will be displayed .
use m@@ oods bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with M@@ ood@@ le support . the option turns the experimental function of the m@@ oods bar@@ ometer .
shaping the mood : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with M@@ ood@@ le support . this changes the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer .
when this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files will be stored at the location of the appropriate music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files will be stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; Amar@@ ok should be started when a browser is required .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
save play@@ lists when you exit , automatically save the current playlist to the end of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist at the end of the end .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok will use ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files will be saved .
visible piece changes visible when changing the play@@ lists to keep the play@@ lists window up / down to keep the current piece in the visible area of the window .
changes to the context browser automatically display the context browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the Fon@@ ts section you can set the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; select by selecting custom fon@@ ts , the otherwise grey section will be activated . you can select fon@@ ts for the following area : playlist windows , player windows and context browsers . press Select ... , so you can choose a font from the selection dialog .
with the choice of Custom color scheme , you have the spo@@ ilt of choice and you can set your own color scheme . use the color selection below for foreground and background color .
resume playback at start means that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start resume playback automatically with the piece at the place with which it was stopped at the last stop .
the On @-@ Screen display enables you to switch on the O@@ SD . when on @-@ screen display is connected , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click select ... to select the font for the O@@ SD from the dialog . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors gives you the possibility to adjust the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . a click on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection . if own colors are not enabled , the default colors will be used .
the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards the O@@ SD can be adapted to your own needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is designed for X@@ iner@@ ama users , allowing you to set the O@@ SD to appear on which screen of a multiple monitor environment .
the Audio output box allows you to select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down field . some drivers will activate further settings in this map .
the collection box collection is used to set up all settings for your collection , including the folder and the type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folders , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , mark the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes to set up how to proceed with the selected folders .
search sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the selected and their sub@@ folders will be searched for music .
monitor changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders to changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import Play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists added to your collection folder ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will appear later in the playlist browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further device in the sub @-@ window My@@ S@@ q@@ l is required .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l device section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; under Calcul@@ ator : enter the host on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . then the network port is entered under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data you need to connect to the database .
the file last@@ .@@ f@@ m establishes the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and if necessary create music recommendations for the current piece .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send played pieces and update the profile : this setting makes it possible &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
invo@@ ke similar performers : after activating this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list of similar performers to the played piece . you can view the list in the context browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and no other K@@ DE packages . so you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the included programs , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; needs some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minim@@ ally .
some features such as the O@@ SD assume that your window manager will keep up the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , as these provide an excellent development environment .
most likely , one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library for days . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer on bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also app@@ end the broken file that causes the crash . afterwards , you can delete the file and let the collection again be recre@@ ated .
most of the time this is because tag@@ li@@ ad crashes when reading met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
make sure that all of the used libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this results in crashes when editing the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then disable autom@@ . disable when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace ( the e @-@ mail will automatically open during a crash ) . if this is a frequent crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed .
this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ information , but don &apos;t label them as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script resol@@ ves the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the status de@@ activ@@ ates in grey and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases , you have to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : cat@@ amar@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , please check if Amar@@ ok is using the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ o@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any conflic@@ ting Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first .
there are several options . most installation issues are most easily solved by the help of an expert using your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the # Amar@@ ok channel .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for searching for help . please only use a bug there if something is wrong with the fixing of a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only an empty playlist appears .
this is easy . use the file browser on the left @-@ hand side and open the folder you want . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intuitive , the start sub@@ window has been converted into the statisti@@ c window . you will find it under Extras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for rating by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
to rate pieces , the evaluation column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and choose column displays review . you can also use the short@@ cuts Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , then hit Del on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select From Play@@ list Rem@@ ove from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and let it fall there just as you would make it with other files too . it &apos;s as simple as that : - )
in the playlist of the playlist , right beside the addition button , the playlist will be stored . click on it .
probably the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config is missing . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . in addition , you can find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no ! yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used one from the back@@ end independent approach , so the real question must be Which media types supports G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support virtually any imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and P@@ NG !
it may ! you may use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which doesn &apos;t include MP3 decoder in default ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 node , input button
start the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s ab : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device has to provide a mixer . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and to simultaneously stream audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify a different S@@ ink ( for example , sink ) .
you can &apos;t just send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would only hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
even X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound server with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see the next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less dre@@ gs react the visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes and Amar@@ ok . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you must register all the components . follow @-@ up register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask the I@@ RC channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( end Amar@@ ok previously ! ) : - Download , compile and install it . then run all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer ( you will find the module folder with you @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it again . start &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .

thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and run the alarm with this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playback . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you will be wo@@ ken up by the soft sounds of music that you have stopped before going to bed .
how to find the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running titles when you &apos;re on another computer ?
if a working SS@@ H environment is present , you can proceed as follows : this command gives you the interpreter and title of the running piece : SS@@ H -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ User Name Amar@@ ok player now@@ playing
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this requires your identification in the ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA file .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ windows . hit the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size .
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + right mouse button represents a piece in the click sequence into the queue . pressing the input button after a search in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky features , but what about the icon in the system section of the control bar ?
click the &amp; R@@ M@@ B@@ n ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers to display .
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is located on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok , the collection database can not be created and many error messages appear on the console . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click on the audio CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with several folders . for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . instead , you will instead take files from the folders mp3 or o@@ gg .

basically this fits the previous rating with a decreasing number based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence each individual assessment has on the overall result .
you can add the review for a piece by clicking on a column header in the playlist window . then you can change the evaluation of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by clicking the right mouse button on the piece and selecting Edit : select Review or F@@ 2 . you can also edit the review in the metadata dialog .
the developers don &apos;t want you to tell you when to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed publishing plan that is not to be combined with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new function in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find annoying . disable the option icon while playing anim@@ ate in the General Settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings tool@@ bars ... and take the desired changes there .

audio c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to the information being sent to which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free of charge and you only need a free user name and password . audio c@@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; supported .
if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore a lot of error reports .
presumably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine has not compiled these output modules . you need to configure &amp; install Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ?
you probably need to install the package G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel . the same goes for x@@ ine , you must install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you must install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel .
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos;s no type .. How can I fix this ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : use no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .

you will receive the There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play an MP3 stream , but the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad module is not installed . install the module and then run as system administrator . then restart Amar@@ ok .
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use the second sound card with Amar@@ ok ?
set up Am@@ ok ... audio output to enter the device . typically , for example h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with onboard AC@@ 97 code@@ c and a USB audio device :
p@@ c@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { h@@ w : 0 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ int@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
enter in the setup dialog of x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of converting the sample rate , channels and so on .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the check@@ mark on sound card m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio issue with Arts will not be taken care of . of course you are allowed to take this problem by yourself ! if you want , you can become the new so much needed super@@ visor for Arts : )
listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard that will be displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you don &apos;t like to upgrade your collection afterwards , or just don &apos;t like the wizard , then this quick start guide will help you . with your help you will have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; set up in just a few minutes .
the small text box for filtering the collection makes it easier for you to search for specific pieces . if you are happy with the playlist , then the tree view will immediately save the remaining entries . if you are happy with the playlist , you can save it by pressing the button playlist . you will find this button in the tool@@ bar of the playlist window .
if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , and you have enabled the option to im@@ porting play@@ lists , then you can already find these play@@ lists in the tree view . with a right click on a playlist , you get different ways to load the playlist .
to play an audio CD , please choose actions audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with several folders and the CD pieces in WAV format . simply drag the WAV files into the playlist and then press the button Play@@ back .
the audio CD function uses the protocol audio CD : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . in addition , some additional packages are listed which make work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more pleasant .
if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you also need to install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player also has &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important features .
this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok are used , including creating a collection and a playlist .
the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window is a disk display showing the currently running track or current stream . directly below is the area , the playing time , bit rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current play . a click on this area changes the display of the already expi@@ red playing time to the remaining play time of the piece .
in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio @-@ analy@@ zers , also under the drive text display . you can change by using the available Analy@@ zer by clicking on the area with the left mouse button .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . hit d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , exten@@ sible window .
the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also displayed under the running text display . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the playlist window , while the E@@ Q button is used to set up E@@ quali@@ zer .
the rest of the player window consists of the play buttons , the volume control and the play position slider . use the slider to adjust the play position or volume . with the playback buttons , you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece .
the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from Classic to Techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets .
to display the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you select the E@@ quali@@ zer check box , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation .
the Play@@ list of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that do not exist in any other player . but don &apos;t let the abundance of functions deter you , they &apos;re all easy to use .
the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left side is the navigation area . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context browser .
the context browser displays different information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be adjusted with the help of context @-@ browser designs . the context @-@ browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and artist . these three sub@@ windows will later be explained in detail .
if you have used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used , you might notice that the sub @-@ window has dropped . the information displayed there has now been distributed to other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in addition , the information in the statistics window can be viewed ( Extras statistics ) .
the music sub @-@ window displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the artist and the album .
the first area in this sub @-@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to track the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon gives you more information about the current play . you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
to display cover images in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ ng will be preferred . the context browser will also display cover images embedded in either the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces it will play immediately .
among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this performer . this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can choose which information should be displayed in the music sub@@ window . right @-@ click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work up and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all the pieces in each area to start playing immediately . you can also right @-@ click on it and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist by right @-@ click and then from the context menu .
in the sub@@ window text , the downloaded lyrics are displayed for the current piece . this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is running , you can choose which should be started .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version will then be stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is required .
the Search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Artist - only group the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are ignored .
group@@ ing Artist / Album - First of all the pieces will be sorted according to the artist and below will be a further division after the respective album . if you want to see con@@ stell@@ ations or soundtrack albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Differ@@ ent Artists .
group@@ ing Artist / year - Album - Sor@@ ted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is used .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically by each other . the performer is ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - Your pieces will first be sorted by genre and , among them , by artist .
group@@ ing Genre / Artist / Album - This setting works as well as the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the performer .
with the help of the remaining buttons you can adjust and combine group@@ ing at will .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically re @-@ record your collection once you change something to the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , it might take a while .
a search filter is located directly beneath the tool@@ bar . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . for use of this filter , see the section on the playlist in this manual .
the search filter contains a selection box with which you can filter the last added pieces to your collection . you can choose from the last 24 hours up to a year . of course , you can also select your entire collection , so that the filter is switched off virtually .
by clicking the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will get the following options .
load - This empty the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play .
app@@ end to play@@ lists - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry , you will reach the same effect .
set pieces in queue - This function will add the selected pieces to the queue . this will play you next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . they are asked for a name under which the list should be saved .
transfer Media Player - Add the pieces into the queue for transfer to the media player . for more details , see the section on the media player browser .
all pieces of this interpreter will burn / burn to CD - This will send the selected pieces to K@@ 3@@ b and burn either as a data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( s ) move files to the tr@@ ash bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
mark the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears under different interpre@@ ters .
list Mark@@ up - Change the album marked as a compilation back to a normal album . after that the album will no longer be displayed under different interpre@@ ts , but again under the associated interpreter .
the play@@ lists browser is easy to use with many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes smart play@@ lists .
the bottom part of the playlist &apos;s browser contains the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist containing the pieces in your collection that has never been played .
also self @-@ created smart play@@ lists are possible . just click on Smart playlist to open the dialog for creating a new Smart playlist . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the sub@@ window media player will be used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; be included in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod after performer sorts in the upper list view of the media player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list Interpre@@ t . if you are done , click Apply . thus , the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . if the transfer is complete , quit y &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and solve the drive connection for your iPod .
among the tool@@ bar is a search area with which you can search for a file . search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because all the files in the file list are hidden , which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser is an address bar with which you can fetch music from a entered URL . if you enter for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z , you can access music in the music .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag the music from there into the playlist and let it fall .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files can be difficult by simply dropping down . in that case , holding down the shift key can be helpful : this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
you can change the order by simply drag the entries with the mouse to the desired place . as soon as you enter the letters , only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text box is empty again .
if you enter through spaces separated search terms , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all search terms . for example , if you enter one two , the search will find all the entries that contain one , two and three .
if you enter a OR between the search terms OR , search for entries containing either one or the other search term . for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces containing one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) are found .
if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then complete the search term with Griff@@ on feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that contain Mike Old@@ field , but not for entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for bigger or smaller . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . This looks for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , put a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain something .
you can combine these syntax variants as you like . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment .
you can set the sequences of entries by holding down the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then right @-@ click in the desired order on the entries . the entries will then receive a label with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the playlist &apos;s tool@@ bar is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left hand side , you will find the Add button that you can add to the playlist .
next , the buttons will follow undo and restore , so you can undo or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the tool@@ bar there is a unique , magni@@ fied analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer .
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as the one you want to display in the Player window over the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
there are many more buttons available for the tool@@ bar , for example playback controls and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and setting up tool@@ bars ... select .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information on the playlist . it displays the title of the current play , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for shu@@ ffle mode and retri@@ eval can be easily changed by clicking twice in the corresponding display area with the mouse .
you can also hide the status bar . to do this , disable the status bar flag in the General Settings .
the context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the menu in the playlist . above this menu , you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
a click on this entry brings up the visu@@ alisation Plugins window . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; select .
this entry hides a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover administration is a useful tool to manage your cover images . you can start it by selecting actions cover administration in your collection browser .
the cover management contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the artist on the left @-@ hand side .
with the View menu , you can choose what should be displayed in the cover administration . select from :
the queue management received your big move in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature you will have more control over the playlist . after you set a piece into the queue a number is displayed next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 will play first , 2 as second , and so on .
queue management . if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the tune in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue administration .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are pre@@ defined ( details for setting up these play@@ lists later ) .
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add more random pieces while playing .
add pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audio c@@ ac@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a load .@@ f@@ m profile to make this dynamic playlist work .
double click on the playlist you want , drag it to the playlist window , or right @-@ click on you and then select Char@@ ge . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist .
the two pre @-@ set Mo@@ di Zu@@ fäl@@ liger Mix and playlist mix immediately fill up your playlist and you will need to add at least one piece from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added to the next piece change , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece .

if this setting is not active , your playlist will grow continuously , the setting for upcoming pieces will be ski@@ pped and they will not be dup@@ lic@@ ated in this playlist . if the setting is active , the played pieces will be removed , taking into account the setting of the played pieces .
played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist and you can easily see which pieces have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces to be added to each played piece to the playlist . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will grow continuously , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the right @-@ hand settings have already been described in the previous section . on the left @-@ hand side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you tick more than one playlist , add &amp; Amar@@ ok ; add random items from each of the play@@ lists .

&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that also offers &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; therefore sel@@ ects &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; but a higher quality for burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional audio encoding and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dek@@ oder and En@@ coder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ 1 audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ co@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 @-@ En@@ coder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code@@ c for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder and the external audio en@@ coder module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : further libraries for processing different audio formats . for example , with ff@@ m@@ peg it is possible to de@@ code WMA files and then burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ x Audio En@@ coder module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video editing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ Ma@@ ger : a fully featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs .
Norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard stage . for example , this can be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the unpleasant effect that the music pieces are reproduced differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically play all the videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project .
save the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name .
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is displayed , with which you can choose folder and file name for the project file .
save all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call file save for each project file .
closes the current project . if a project has been modified and not yet saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to take place . you can then disc@@ ard between saving and changes . furthermore , you can also ab@@ ort the closing and keep the project open .
closes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for each un@@ saved project what to do with it , just as if you were calling file closing for each project file .
closes all opened projects and ends &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project you will be asked what to do with it , as if you were calling file closing .
when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project using the appearing dialog . that will have the same effect as if you drag the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD .
this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button B@@ race , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the medium . the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data .
open the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make a lot of project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the What is the ? help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; files from a previous session to import into the current project . this is useful when it is not used for a multi @-@ session CD . it is meant for you rather than help so that you can see the files and folders already present on the media .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removes no files from the media , it only hides the previously imported files .
open the CD @-@ Cop@@ y dialog . this also allows you to copy a CD to another medium without the project file . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a CD , which you can then burn later . furthermore , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of a normal copy . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
open the DVD copying dialog . this also allows you to copy a DVD to another medium without the project file . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a DVD , which will then be able to burn later . also , the conversion / reduction of a DVD with the help of the copy dialog is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to accommodate the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form .
open the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete all content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
open the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , which will completely delete the contents . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ o * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you have to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
the dialog will prompt you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can then be fired inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ously by pressing the burning button .
this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used anywhere . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings and even options for changing the size and cutting black edges .
displays information about the inserted media . this information is displayed in the table of contents and contains properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is enabled , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is enabled , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not enabled , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view provides an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , their contents will be shown in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and unlock the drive or ej@@ ecting the media .
the content view also allows selecting and dra@@ gging files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD has been selected in the folder view .
the header is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ line has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view from the other views .
this opens a dialog box to change the short@@ cut assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the keyboard mapping to the bottom .
this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct auth@@ oriz@@ ations for burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are required , so you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when starting the wizard .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work at first . this dialog is intended for person@@ alization and fine adjustment of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , as many others &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can , for example , be controlled via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program or the somewhat more convenient K@@ d@@ co@@ p program . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and the style of your task is crucial to which of the accompanying programs you give preference .
in this chapter , we assume that you use the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions you need to make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then type something like the following on the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; program have in common , supported &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides features such as copy@@ CD , format DVD and other features for creating new projects .
void copy@@ ri@@ f ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void copy@@ C@@ d ( ) void copies void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively , you can obtain a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then get a reference to the project using the # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( K@@ URL : : list ur@@ ls , Q@@ String ) void remo@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ String New@@ Name ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then adds files to the new folders :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fill@@ ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; reader for &amp; k@@ de ; with it can easily be read audio CD ; s can be read out and stored in MP3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are also possible , depending on the en@@ coder installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is the interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard disk ) and by many encoding that en@@ code these WAV files . currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) is supported by default .
first the title of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per titles ) are compressed into the mp3 or O@@ GG format or also in other formats like the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , it is used by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other co@@ ders must be installed . all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is very likely not necessary to compile it yourself . however , if FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required .
which encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction about codi@@ fiers , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , use &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; it is not possible to read any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device , it is not possible to circum@@ vent any copy protection .
while setting up only needs to be performed ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , the daily handling for reading a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to the understanding of the slim approach of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble across at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which encoding programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; retri@@ eving information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without network , where everything is manually recorded .
this is just a short list of the main window commands . on the page step by step example , you will find more information about how this program is used and screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program .
starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data according to the setup of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be made . )
start reading and - if an en@@ coder has been configured in the Code of Con@@ figuration tab in the Setup dialog - the encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available en@@ co@@ ders , so that the selection can be read with another en@@ coder as the default . it is to be noted that previously the en@@ coder was configured in the Con@@ figuration dialog in the Con@@ figuration dialog .
open the file manager so that an already read file is selected for encoding rather than a full &amp; CD ; read and code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , picks ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main setup dialog of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; with various flash@@ cards ( such as en@@ coder , to set up the en@@ coder ) . here you need to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , encoding and compression rates and helps you choose the right en@@ coder .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate the differences become less important since both co@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless supplied free with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions
+ high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly lower quality with lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play@@ sets is present .
MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto @-@ stereo equipment . today - initially 2009 - these devices mostly support only MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
--@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has already quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music by young people , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better stereo hi @-@ fi systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information fet@@ ched manually or fet@@ ched from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet is available in the program as a list of parameters . you can be passed / used with &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; and the encoding program to create the folder and file name as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the co@@ processor and these parameters here . the manual or the help of the en@@ co@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example to add title to the keyword ( English : tag ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are en@@ coded with l@@ ame , the -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = app@@ endi@@ x in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database , in which people can read / enter the audio CDs , so that all others can download this information instead of themselves into the machine . it is to be noted that only text is spoken here : &amp; CD ; title , artist , name of pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( editor &apos;s note ) is not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from issuing information publicly available on the CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . all information can be obtained from a stroll through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is actively used to select a check box ( send an address ) . in this way of configuration , it appears , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( this can only know the programmer who checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server needs to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and compens@@ ates the load between the hosts .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; if you want to know more exactly , search the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package needs to be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this is not done yet .
to save the read WAV files , the en@@ coder and thus the desired file format can be selected . when opening , pre@@ defined l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) are available on the tab for setting up the en@@ coder . other en@@ co@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the code@@ c package must be installed by the concerned Linux distribution before the en@@ coder can be used . this is also required for pre @-@ defined co@@ ders . more information on the co@@ ders can be found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a en@@ coder , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; Con@@ sole ) . in doing so , &apos; l@@ ame &apos; must be replaced by the name of the installed en@@ coder .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , writing and reading real on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia as well as the audio encoding of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you don &apos;t want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check the sleeve of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you are using other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood all , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you &apos;ll get enough information to set up those areas that let the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will launch the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) .
you need to have c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can , for example , be found with a search engine , as it is considered not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission ( eg ; attempting to copy something into it ) .
the first section covers the basic set @-@ up of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; something that is probably done only once and
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; what has to be repeated for each reading &amp; CD ;
here we determine the encoding to be used for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
although we can change these settings at any time , we are most likely not going to change it every time you read a &amp; CD ; once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is handed over to the reading program so it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look at the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for the CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
there is not much to do here . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything is left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
just select in case of incomplete information , so that you will be informed when information about creating keywords ( tags ) is missing .
the CD ; Settings . just select both entries . we are comfortable and leave the CD ; data can be downloaded automatically via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet to access the fre@@ ed@@ b server while reading the &amp; CD .
the second drop @-@ down field is easier , if a &amp; CD is found ; this is associated with low risk if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , you can easily change the directory or fil@@ en@@ ame , and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to enter all manually , de@@ activate the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . however , if you download the database before . however , this is above 6@@ 20 MB in size , consider this twice whether this is worthwhile . to fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , you must select the two selection fields , at least the first .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data inquiry , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server via the Internet . how does the system know which data is to get the CD ? read the section on fre@@ ed@@ b . set everything as shown in the screen@@ shot .
mode : we did not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org site and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work simultaneously as far as the server is concerned , as many fire@@ walls are bu@@ cking the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the 80 , since the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example we do not want to transmit data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box .
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of concur@@ rent pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author does not know , therefore simply try himself .
CD ; disc@@ ard after reading the last piece : check this to the &amp; CD ; to disc@@ ard at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , you / must specify the path / folder in which the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself .
set everything as it is on the screen shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be brow@@ sed to the right to see everything .
--@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is sufficient for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is on average about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the generation of tags to V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted when needed . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of WAV files to be codi@@ fied at the same time : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine , it can be tried to en@@ code more than one WAV file simultaneously .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic set up of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for every reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change it again .
in this section it is described as the process of reading the &amp; CD ; we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , was described in the previous section and furnished . first , a connection to the Internet is built , since we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look somewhat different from the data fet@@ ched from fre@@ ed@@ b . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually instead of retri@@ eving them from the internet . comments will point to the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this is not yet done , the &amp; CD must now be inserted into the drive defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; can be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , look in the questions and answers to the help section or go back to the previous section on the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD has been successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already filled in and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; a window will be displayed , and you can select the database entry , which in your opinion best fits your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you did not select the check box for the automatic retri@@ eval of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but get the data from the internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - Input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer has to be entered in the &quot; Current Tit@@ le &quot; input field unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece .
the comment field of the album can be used for the individual comments , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD .
note : after successful retri@@ eval of the data from fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words with capital letters begin or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any un@@ desired comments .
note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least to what &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; maximum allowed .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later with tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also recre@@ ate ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all en@@ co@@ ders or file formats . see the help of the en@@ coder for more information .
just choose an entry that obviously matches the style of the end @-@ of @-@ the @-@ fly CD ; in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the information anyway . for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after choosing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the window of the CD editor will appear again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the input data we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ; enter .
note : this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button on the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are shown above the BO@@ M .
note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line will switch off the selection of the piece , or press the All items button at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once .
if the reading process is started by clicking on the button selection process , this window appears for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on .
click on the tab orders to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the jobs . the first piece is currently read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message you will see if you are trying to work with a co@@ dic@@ ator you haven &apos;t installed yet . pieces that have not been successfully en@@ coded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we typ@@ ed here in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the first piece &apos;s reading .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . this makes reading and coding in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that appears to be configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding .
now the last title is read while another piece is en@@ coded and a third order is placed in the queue of the en@@ coder . after encoding the last piece , a small window with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window will be displayed .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the en@@ coder of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; today , you will be able to download CVS as part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package . however , most distri@@ butions contain a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you read this , you probably already have done it ...
this section is directed to people who compile from source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs when it runs , then the following is true for you :
a program that calls many different programs , has many variations of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen@@ shots of the different card cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hi , still reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the initial start of the program , without any indication as to continue from this somewhat empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it all about ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual on &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; it is intended as the first version for a manual on &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator . and if you read this , he left this section and is therefore agre@@ eing to this suggestion .
strange if you have managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ aoke player from &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , it also has some properties that other &amp; UNIX ; MIDI players don &apos;t have with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver , which is needed for G@@ US cards .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to k@@ mid .
supports both existing standards to store text into MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid will automatically determine the used procedure .
session support . when you end up playing a song during playing a song , k@@ mid will start playing with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can choose Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . this also works with several songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the tool@@ bar , select the entry from the menu item , or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece will automatically start as soon as you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( in several pieces it will be added to a collection and then played succ@@ essively . )
as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and running down and down with the slider .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of the template and change the playing speed . to get back the original tempo , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a play is played , a pressure on the space bar , like pressing a button , or selecting the menu entry break in the menu , interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics event and others both . some pieces do not have any text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set what events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically calculated , which a song is used , so that you don &apos;t have to manually set it . however , if you select automatic text selection in the Settings menu , the Kar@@ aoke text is automatically selected . however , you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set an event type , select the text events or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summari@@ ze . in this section you can see how to efficiently use collections .
to create a collection , open the collection manager first . you will find it in the menu Collection under the point Organ@@ ize .... Click here on New and specify the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Cop@@ y and then specify the name for the new collection . in the beginning , this collection will contain the same songs as the original ones .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the winn@@ ings in the collection manager .
the temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when you exit the application , this collection is not stored . remember , if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager , where you can add a song by adding the Add button . it appears again the file dialog with which help you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on the automatic addition to the collection .
when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) .
if Automati@@ cally add to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the pieces that are still open .
to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the sub @-@ menu sequences of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to skip a song , select the next song , next song from the menu item , or press the arrow to the right .
to jump back a song , select the button Previous piece , the item Previous item from the menu item or press the arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted , but it does not matter since it is not saved when leaving .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ map transl@@ ates General @-@ MIDI Events into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI @-@ map that converts all Change patch to B@@ right piano events into the Events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type , making it sound like a trumpet , if originally a piano should play .
if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI @-@ Map because all sound cards are GM @-@ compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps , so you have to edit the appropriate file from your hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all required re@@ plac@@ ements for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , it is a prerequisite for each occurrence to have a different Text@@ ID ( see below ) .
Def@@ ine PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; A further key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as email so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
this section shows how the patches are m@@ apped from General MIDI to your specific keyboard . general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the equ@@ ation sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
for example , if your keyboard does not support a gun shot ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) which sounds similar to a gun . to do so , enter the following into the PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if a MIDI file should play a note with Patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that the term Tro@@ mmel patch is meant to represent a different percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the tone means the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards possess ) .
the key@@ map section is used to indicate how tones are shown on a specific channel or instrument . use is :
as with the PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you must create 128 entries .
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used mainly to map sound to the perc@@ ussions channel . for example , take a look at the included key@@ maps .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to exchange the first and second channel , simply make it in the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards that have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern :
n is the channel shown on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map must be defined with the name Name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which attempt to change the patch on this channel . in this case , always patch x is used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch can be useful for example to always use the perc@@ ussions patch on the perc@@ ussions channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio speci@@ fies in which pitch Ben@@ der events are multip@@ lied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch Ben@@ der Event with the value n , this is converted to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then rel@@ a@@ yed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to prevent dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM has a keyboard that will play a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der @-@ Event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a note higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards attempt to play two tones up to one oc@@ tave . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI @-@ Map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . this can be found in the menu under Settings , Spot MIDI Settings
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you can see which sounds are played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel , there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed one instrument , the button lights no more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view ( until now ) has two different views to display the played tones . view the view from the Settings menu under the point Channel view : settings
the pace @-@ LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find , for example , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; . this allows the same MIDI file to perform very different results on two different devices , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
good , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you get a similar sound quality .
this can happen when you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
agree to support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
make sure to enable automatic addition to the collection previously . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow button on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . to restore the standard tempo , you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Desktop with my MIDI @-@ folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( when I play a MIDI file ) or if I want to play a file , only switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; pull .
if you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection , turn the automatic addition to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ Sch@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first , you just want to play the first file . so , set the setting Automatic add to the collection and open A.@@ amid . your temporary collection then contains exactly those a MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me to program on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a . at the moment I &apos;m studying programming , collecting MIDI files , making music and pro@@ positions .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really enjoy a great joy when sending me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will count among friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; but before you send a MIDI file , you should contact me , because I may already have the file .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and won &apos;t get any money from anyone . I would like to point out that I &apos;m just re @-@ programming because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch of AW@@ E cards was too high .
my thanks also to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the AW@@ E support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , O@@ la Sig@@ ur@@ dson , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ sel@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , error message or even a suppor@@ tive e @-@ mail .
and of course my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the net that give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition can be found on his homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ agon@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , look for information and view images . you will also find links to sites with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AW@@ E card .
if you do not have a sound card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you cannot of course hear music .
if you have any problems , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Mail@@ ing@@ lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or phon@@ on supported formats , as well as to play DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the Docum@@ entation for &amp; k@@ not ; was not finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE &apos;s website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Ma@@ iling list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is a window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that is only displayed when information is returned .
it is possible to save preferred connections under the Book@@ mark menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Last@@ ing Play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level . if you select an entry , its group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the cli@@ cked entry .
the different files in directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / , can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . simply click on a name of a category , choose from the View menu and next edit mode . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part will be displayed .
after changing XML files , you need to choose from the Edit menu and select either the editing mode , or select another category .
all changes will be lost when you leave edit mode or select another group without matching the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files ..
the animation during starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ layer err@@ c and modify &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; will note files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during starting doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . however , this would be annoying in the end @-@ animation , so the user can end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation may be the viewing of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ g ; sr@@ c = &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / gt ; / ; ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / ; ; &amp; lt ; / ; ; &amp; lt ; / ; ; &amp; lt ; / ; ; &amp; lt ; / ; ; &amp; lt ; / ; ; &amp; lt ; / ; ;
there is a tab for M@@ Player configuration in the Con@@ figuration dialog of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; button in the tool bar of K@@ M@@ Player . here the output of mp@@ layer can be seen .
there is no rider for this playback device in the configuration dialog of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; everything must be configured through manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c , such as setting up the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of a &apos; flash &apos; played with the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even include the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
for the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; to play in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; module as service provider for the mim@@ e @-@ type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog boxes of K@@ DE must be specified .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and searched for error messages concerning loading the browser module library . if no errors occur here , the back@@ end output is within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( View , console , or console from the context menu ) .
so that a given back@@ end for a specific mim@@ e type is always taken ( of course only if this is also determined ) , this must be done by changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ layer err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should play all o@@ gg files :
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be watched , the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured . to do this , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player , the dialogue can be found in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port . there , ports should be detected by which one is selected ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b in it .
since the V@@ DR support from K@@ M@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this way of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server must be functional . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server , the following must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
internally , K@@ M@@ Player uses different names for the sources . at the time of the creation of this documentation , these are dv@@ d@@ na@@ v@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . when enabled , they start playing the playlist .
is there any hints on how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom can be run as user root after the device is inserted . it is absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom is on the CD@@ ROM drive .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support , and is needed to compile &amp; Ki@@ le ;
lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to be used on the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution . for installation , documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project includes some pre @-@ compiled packages from &amp; Ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; website .
this manual is for everyone - independent of experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users hardly need to read this manual . however , all the suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , contact via the box ; -@@ website should be established .
if you have any questions or if you want to compile and compile , please refer to the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides the opportunity to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this one easy , direct and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . furthermore , the easy to use wizard , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and powerful project management .
to learn more about and its possibilities , the manual about Kate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter &apos;s work with the editor of &amp; kate .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right language : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , also a La@@ ie ( English ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros can also be used . a less sophisticated but more realistic explanation is that it origin@@ ates from the last name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while here is only a good overview on &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book . in order to be able to master correctly , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
the introduction contains at least the command \ \ Docum@@ class , the body starts with the command \ \ beginning { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ end { document } .
the quick @-@ entry wizard of &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful function for fast creation of a document in &amp; box ; The selection of the wizard ( menu ) provides some possibilities for creating the document .
document classes : this includes the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , films &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined .
encoding : this sets the character encoding . it should use the character encoding of the system . modern systems increasingly use UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best , UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be selected ( for correct processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used auxiliary packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration you only need to select the check box in the check box .
articles ( DIN ) , Cover ( DIN ) , Cover ( DIN ) , Cover ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) .
new users do not have to worry about this . it is just a brief description of the functions and further information to be found in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - just like other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ matched ) . if you see larger areas of a green text on the screen , it is very likely that some mathematical environment has not been closed .
with automatic execution of the surroundings , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically generates a blank line ( for entering the text ) and the corresponding line to file the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set in the menu box ; La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document to be divided into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ section the lowest element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; file search can be very helpful . once a DVI ; file is created , &amp; Ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the actual output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the file search , the elements of the DVI @-@ file are plu@@ cked with the editor and as soon as an element in the DVI ; file has been cli@@ cked , the corresponding opposite of it . as soon as on a section in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text cli@@ cked , the corresponding place in the DVI ; file is inj@@ ected .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set via project project preferences .
quick construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result will be displayed automatically ( unless there are any errors in the source code ) .
file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is transferred to the file , and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick construction .
when viewing the Edit tool@@ bar , the three large selection boxes should be picked up . the selection fields have been developed for quick inser@@ tion of common elements into the document . the first drop @-@ down field is for quick outline of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for sub@@ division are :
the Other is for items such as key words , notes notes or references . the available possibilities are :
name : with this command a name for a section , a picture or any other element is created .
reference : used for reference to a defined name ( selection via a selection field possible ) .
the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; by hand also .
the last drop @-@ down field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¼ ck is used for determining the font size . it can be specified the font sizes for the main text , the notes notes , etc .
when calling &amp; Ki@@ le , two choices are available : 1 . the Wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and setting the settings .
the par@@ enth@@ eses under the command \ \ Docum@@ class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; speci@@ fies the font size . if the font file is not specified at the beginning , this can also be done in the text .
once the above source code example has been typ@@ ed , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the Men@@ Ã ¼ s Build or the Fast@@ ener button .
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically exec@@ utes the storage .
failure to compile the document should be looked for in logging after errors . when using fast construction , &amp; Ok@@ ular should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be considered .
an environment ( engl@@ .@@ environment ) is a text which is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font ramp 12 is created and only a few columns should have another font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } will then allow the change of font sizes within the environment â € ( English Hu@@ ge ) .
the changes are only supervised within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } . there is no restriction ( number ) for changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the legi@@ bility and usability of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , bold printing , ital@@ ics , sub@@ missions etc. can be added . these commands end with the \ \ end command or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is valid for ital@@ ics and stays closed until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in a set can be itali@@ c displayed with \ \ emp@@ h { Word } .
\ \ ratio : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
following the writing of the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; mark@@ up language , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le follows .
once a bit of text has been entered in the wizard , a few adjustments should be made for the better read@@ ability of the document . at least one quote , a few places in the bold and itali@@ c pressure and a poem may come to the application in order to see the differences in these commands .
once the document has been viewed , the editor @-@ view or C@@ tr@@ l E can return to the editor ( for the internal viewer ) . in an external viewer its windows have to be closed .
once the DVI @-@ file has been created , the document can be printed out or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try it out and have fun .
DVI ; is a common file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ r. ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi outputs such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps are necessary as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed using the file print ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI @-@ file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text was created , the conversion into changed other formats can begin using the kno@@ bs in the tool@@ bar .
the preliminary search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides an appropriate setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Bin@@ der files . to do so , simply set up the modern under Settings box ... Tools building should be selected .
to execute the default search , the mouse cur@@ sor must be positioned in a line of the source text and cli@@ cked on pre @-@ select search . the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI ; viewer is then done .
with this function in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; with one click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document by &amp; Ki@@ le ; opened and jump to the corresponding line . to do this , &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; used as text editor ( set settings ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
if the &amp; DVI does not open , an error may be available . if there is an error , this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window .
the log file tells the error source in the source code . in the editor you can then specify the fla@@ ws of the La@@ Te@@ X errors and the latest La@@ Te@@ X errors . to view the error message , you must click on the error in the log and &amp; box ; jump to the correct line .
when cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document . the pre @-@ set options are :
when selecting a blank document , a document can either be re@@ written from the ground or the wizard will be used for the quick creation of a new document . for more information , please refer to the section .
frequent users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created in &amp; Ki@@ le ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or a new file must be created . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by drawing an existing document and selecting File Tem@@ plate from a document ...
when creating a new document from a template using File New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set in Settings box ... Settings General settings .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by entering the document class . typically , it is used as following columns : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { items } .
the easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created this way , the following steps must be taken :
when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the standard ones .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files created . if an easy way to create a template is sought , one should search for one on the Internet and be executed under the steps described below .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; Po@@ sters ; as an internal editor . &amp; kate ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the ability of reading and high@@ lighting many different kinds of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for editors ; can be made in the menu directly out &amp; box ;
to learn more about and its possibilities , the manual about Kate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly by reading the chapter &apos;s work with the editor of &amp; kate .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference which can be called over the Men@@ ue La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be used in &amp; lat@@ ex , as well as their syntax .
a double click with added C@@ tr@@ l button to select the &amp; tex ; this means that by clicking on \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ big@@ ware only \ \ par is selected .
when dra@@ gging the text with pressed left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source text can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse and emphasize different kinds of source code . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color .
many assistants can add additional boun@@ ce marks . this is a separate type of book@@ mark within the text . the Men@@ Ã ¼ te Edit boun@@ ce marks or the corresponding key handles allow the jump to the next or last jump . this jumping brand is also highlighted so that it is automatically deleted during the first entry of a character .
the Edit is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; Ki@@ le ; though &amp; kate ; already excellent options were added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; &amp; lat@@ ex ; supports many environments and groups and therefore supports &amp; Ki@@ le ; special commands for their selection . under Edit Cho@@ ices are the following commands for selecting text :
select a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing a blank line on both sides ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source text .
select the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , since this command also includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with a back@@ lash line ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to delete a part of the document , this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del key . &amp; kate ; offers the key menu C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the whole line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers with own commands for a faster possibility . under Edit Rem@@ ove are the following commands to delete the text :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; box ; is included in the description to Edit Excell@@ ent paragraph .
it has already been made clear that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; for other commands under Edit surroundings for a possible simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command , jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment .
if the cur@@ sor is before or inside the \ \ begin { environment } command , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted environmental commands , the overview can quickly be lost . this command closes the last opened environment so that the ne@@ sted environment structure is not destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by braces { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that correspond to those from Edit surroundings .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket .
with this command , jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the welded close @-@ end bracket .
if the cur@@ sor is in front of or behind the welded bracket of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted spar@@ ed groups par@@ enth@@ eses can quickly get lost over the overview above . this command concludes the last group , so the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple quotes are used as G@@ Ã ¤ n@@ se@@ schen . for the useful implementation is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; for two simple quotes will be used . also for finishing the application the character is &quot; used . &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and for two closing quotes for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic entry of the double connection sign can be set up under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X will be switched on and off .
it can also be used for translation specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) and for German or French characters . there are also many other languages available .
when shifting shift ; enter &amp; box ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not only a line break , but also the command \ \ item .
within a table environment , t &amp; box closes ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an end line termin@@ ating .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is smart enough to support pres@@ et &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be added to the box Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X added .
some users want to arrange columns in tables environments and thereby assign all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; Ki@@ le ; tries to replace this . when using Shift ; Alt ; amp ; search &amp; Ki@@ le ; according to the next tab in the underlying line .
although &amp; kate ; already offers a good source code completion , it was added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) . three of them work on demand and the other two are for automatic completion . all these modes can be set for different ways of working under Settings box ... Complete setup .
at the beginning a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } will &amp; box ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for text ) .
when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input is removed and , unfortunately , the completion list is missing . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are naturally removed when selecting a command . alternatively , from &amp; Ki@@ le , jump labels can also be filed , so that an easy jump to these positions is possible by editing boun@@ ce marks and the desired parameters can then be inserted .
settings box ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; complete settings can be made to these lists . you can select different counters for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands as well as general language needs .
the command mode is not necessary for the completion of environments . there must always be a few letters with \ \ begin and the call for completion mode will result in a large list of ambient commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for the completion of the surroundings to be available .
when you call completion mode over the volume editing environment or the Shift key Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically frozen and it will appear \ \ begin { . afterwards , the environment completion can be continued in the simplest way and ending by pressing the input button .
once this is done , the environment will be automatically closed again . once &amp; box ; realize that this is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be added .
under Settings box ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; complete settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of complete functions for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; supports user @-@ defined lists of abbrevi@@ ations , which are immediately replaced by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings box ... Ki@@ le Ver@@ sions can be set up . as an example of a shut@@ down list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which , for example , the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is entered , and the word completion mode is introduced over the volume editing or the C@@ tr@@ l + Alt key , the character L is replaced by the character string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large @-@ size counters are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been found that many people in a document are written more than once . thus , &amp; Ki@@ le ; the completion for all already written words .
this mode can be set up in the menu box ... Ki@@ le Ver@@ sions are shut@@ down . here , the threshold value for displaying the completion can also be specified .
the complete directory files can be installed in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / box / complete / mode / the Persian home folder . mode stands for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
the Graphics dialog box shapes the inser@@ ting of graphics as easy as possible . for the overview of the basics on the graphics formats , the sections should be considered and observed .
PS files are not as well @-@ known as PDF files , but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages . if the PDF output is specified , the pages can be re @-@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file .
in order to examine the results of the work , the source code needs to be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed in the menu creation compile , create conversion and create view .
for comp@@ iling the source code for viewers like &amp; Ok@@ ular ; or the other conversion can be used the key @-@ key Alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI @-@ file can be viewed in the standard @-@ time viewer by Alt ; 4 via Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file converted into a PS file and be viewed by Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the quick @-@ build command , a viewer is usually called after compilation . if no built @-@ in viewer is used , a new window will open each time .
a new project is about the project New Project .... This includes the following information for the project :
when you fill in the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path of the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file must be specified .
the Script function from &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows the execution of EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed via scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be modified in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = box ) with the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a well @-@ developed system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a lot of different help to support the users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; they are delivered with many documents , including a documentation for the pack@@ ets and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference .
this is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a complete operating manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and is therefore ideal for searching for a certain format@@ ting . as this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; box ; in three important book@@ marks .
due to the quantity of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the finding of the right document is not always easy . as possible help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all of the documents and for a graphical surface .
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or tags . from &amp; Ki@@ le , only the results are displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or using the space button opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ led and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source code editor that can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; node ; &amp; box ; is also part of the Fink project , whereby &amp; Ki@@ le ; also on &amp; Mac ; can be executed with OS @-@ X installed .
many thanks to those who asp@@ ire after the continuation of the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project and offer for many hours for the development of tools we all can use under consideration of the &amp; GNU ; License .

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for emails . with the command line interface , you create random signatures or day signatures from a list . this command line interface provides the signatures for external email programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signatures , any signature from the signature file will be read out . by many signatures with different quotes , styles and information , you can create your e @-@ mails varied and unique .
for daily signatures , the same signature is read from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; read out . for each day , use different signatures , as with random signatures , create unique emails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N file New . this gives you a new signature ; in the Sig@@ natur@@ es section . in the Sig@@ natur@@ es section , click on the &amp; lt ; empty signature ; and paste it in the lower section of your new signature .
you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use emails private or professionally , there are always plenty of signatures .
to delete a signature , select it first and then in the Del@@ ete File menu or click on the symbol with the red cross removing in the tool@@ bar .
in order to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click the User &apos;s button on the right and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the key or key combination .
to use &amp; c@@ b ; is &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 required . to attach signatures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature text from the output of a command .

the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . all of these tools use com@@ man@@ ders as a surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base . the combination results in fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows me and how superior it is . if we raise it another piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no more relies on a terminal ; simply click on the icon for the XML processor and done !
this application expects a inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ s is in the ge@@ di@@ tious work folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current work folders and specify the folder in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; html files are deleted each time you start my pro@@ c .
as already said , everyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphic interface for that .
if the newly opened file inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is , then simply select the current working folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
when it comes to an output on the screen , your file is fla@@ wed . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be reviewed is already selected in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then it is easy to file the current file . if not , delete the file from the current file and select the file to be reviewed by another file - file selection .
if you only want to know if the well @-@ shaped file is , click the Well @-@ Form@@ ed review selection .
for use of a &amp; DT@@ D ; which is specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( internal ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and enter the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; schema as well as for the Relax@@ NG review is the specification of the definition UR@@ I ; file selection required .

if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is already selected , then it is easy to select current file . if not , remove the selection of current file and select the file to be processed using the other file selection .
enter the name of the file as the result is named . the file is usually stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; gro@@ unded , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . thus , the plug @-@ in system will benefit immediately and do not have to wait until someone builds the shared in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements .
to install a plugin or a part , we will start with the Edit menu . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows to manage all of the plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location , you can use this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project several individuals in a sort of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and they can be configured using Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nick@@ name and serves to uniquely identify .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders as well as sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the button S@@ etze . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears in bold after they are : text .
nick@@ name and setting your own identity are important in terms of news and notes . see for more information on ann@@ ot@@ ations .
in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team leaders if something is happening . see for more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something particular happens in the project . an example would be recording the opening and closing of the project , so that later can be seen how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is saved , or a script that enters a file into CVS , as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project Settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ sees selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see may be a team or sub @-@ project leader .
ann@@ ot@@ ations are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
enter notes is simple . it can either be selected from the note entry in the Editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword is entered in a comment area followed by note text .
in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where nick@@ name is the default name of the team member , is a role in the project from the following possibilities : team Leader Sub@@ project manager Acc@@ ording to the area and sub @-@ project leaders , the appropriate area or sub @-@ project names should be given , as in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces around the par@@ enth@@ eses and the names are invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only via &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are handled , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up by setting Qu@@ anta ... to be called . this dialog extends over a number of pages that are treated consec@@ u@@ tively .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; concerning tags including car completion can be changed with that . the entries are :
large / lo@@ wer@@ case of tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal bulk / lo@@ wer@@ case means the tags are inserted in the same way they are described in tag@@ ging XML files .
large / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal bulk / lo@@ wer@@ case means the attributes are inserted in the way they are described in the tag@@ ging XML files .
optional tags automatically include : when checked , for tags , for which the closing tag is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted .
not include optional tags automatically : as above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags .
start and finish @-@ day automatically update : if enabled , the corresponding final day will be am@@ ended and vice versa .
automatic creation of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding coding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for det@@ ecting various types of files . using button standard , the default settings can be restored .
standard character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting here is executed by the same in the project features if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D has not been detected .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; builds regular backup copies so that during a power failure or crash at the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as storing the file .
preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in your own view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , making it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
set the default window settings back to default when the user interface is changed by modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cking / app@@ ending views . it comp@@ lies with the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameter .
the warning message area is used to control the display of warnings by hooks of no more questions .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source code view in shared mode . see the different modes see .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the representation of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be set in details .
in the area of the mouse click on the structure tree the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the Stru@@ c@@ tural Tree Con@@ figuration menu , the visibility of knots in the tree , the update frequency of the tree while editing , and how deep in modi@@ fying the structure tree will be opened automatically . empty no@@ des are empty spaces in the text , while empty groups are such in which no element has been found in the current document .
abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s valid . this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the i@@ f@@ clause is slightly different than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript .
plu@@ gins are K@@ part applications from third party , which can be re @-@ used by any K@@ part @-@ capable application , the most well @-@ known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located on a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
input : this information is passed to the plugin when you start , so it can open the current file , the related folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; load component in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; read @-@ only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse to load if this option is not selected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , if the input information is correct . select to save the entry , even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting was completely re@@ developed . the support for the non @-@ needed built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger was set , as well as support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger .
currently only one plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with selecting a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ u@@ gger plug @-@ in , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface :
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view in which all holding points are listed , with time numbers and conditions . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if required , is made , or it tells the plugin to listen to de@@ bu@@ gger requirements . this action is triggered by default if a project is opened , which means a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally does not have to be taken care of .
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ gen &apos;s session starts the session . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates listening to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug requirement . this is equivalent to using a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the Deb@@ u@@ gger output view .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and continuously send information about the monitored variables as well as the current line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will be continued . if the script is started , the script starts with the request .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens , while a script is stopped , the execution goes on . happens before a request is made , the execution starts as soon as a request is made .
the de@@ bu@@ gger implements the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger implements the next instruction in the script , where possible in functions and include it is fixed .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the statement and go to the next one as if there were not the current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog , a variable can be entered or set a new value of a variable .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work by Keith Is@@ dale and this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g , which they can find on ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g.@@ s@@ f.@@ net with many more works by Keith .
this chapter describes how you can adapt to your needs and how to help you become better .
document type Edi@@ ting packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to provide support for brand and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; their simplicity and flexibility makes from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or &amp; CSS ; . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the day folder and the tool@@ bars . tag folders contain two file types , the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files with the extension .@@ tag@@ . tool@@ bars are handy , symbolic des@@ erts of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , which insert text and instructions faster into a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on conversion .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and contents of the properties dialog , the &amp; p@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day . the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; self . tool@@ bars enable quick inser@@ tion of tags into a document without the risk of a typing error .
tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder carries the name of the description language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all of them are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have better insight and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but it contains nothing but a type about itself otherwise .
the type of tag is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid for class class only . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
valid only for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , tag has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other tag . ( only family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a just element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of attribute . in addition , there are other tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element .
speci@@ fies the source code used to fill in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to reach the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a tag that assem@@ bles the elements of a list . it can only happen once for an attribute description . it is a single element type element .
specify the location of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the item is empty .
specify the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined . this element is a just element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a day . this element is a just element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; statement : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces do not affect anything , but watch &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; . this will not cause a break , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and check tag@@ ging Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear , whose simple instructions will follow .
this function is currently not available yet . currently , verification is only performed when the Tag@@ XML files are loaded in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
in the following one example for a family of 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the file name for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following one , an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP is described ; the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; att@@ r name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the fil@@ descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor available for editing DT@@ D &apos;s own DT@@ D settings . with this , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = Ver@@ sion@@ 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D specification . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with settings actions ... to be created . click New Action leads to the same dialog :
the button short@@ cut assigned to this action . by clicking on the user definition button , a short@@ cut symbol can be assigned ; with K@@ 1 the current key short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the specified settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) , which change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) , can be launched . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
first the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . To be found in the following places : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PA@@ TH There are other special variables that can be used in the command line :
% f : we have replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name .
% p@@ id : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text unique is added to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used by the external script .
parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script input from &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . in the selection box input can be determined what is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , directed to the standard output . it can be specified , what should be done with the text written on the standard output , by setting the value the selection box output :
if there are many tags in mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create your own tool@@ bar for each group . in the given case , it is not too many , therefore you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the check .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . pressing the New Action button at the bottom of the window will start editing mode .
complete all required fields and add the tag to the right tool bar .
complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you are planning to use them , enable &quot; Edit day &quot; dialog if available so that you can enter the action when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ug@@ ly symbol ? who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? do we replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics Other Program@@ s ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , choose Edi@@ ting size andern .
please note that the created icon will not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with the view that the day starts , I decided to create a starting button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually interpreted as loose , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start@@ ed@@ ; -@@ tag in the current document will be inserted .
after creating the symbol it must still be connected to the action . this happens via the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . in addition to the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the application button and continue with other tags , if there are any , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the tool@@ bar or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview by some separ@@ ators . open the tool@@ bar setup dialog using settings tool@@ bars . make sure the desired tool@@ bar is selected .
after selecting the element to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the separ@@ ator supports the group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar might think that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by absorbing all symbols to make sure everything is working .
back up in the right folder . after new XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language that you like best . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; repository whether someone has already done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to search for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for these document@@ ations e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html 21.@@ 1 = day 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = day 3.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see the &amp; PHP ; documentation such as :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x@@ .@@ html ... Language Reference
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the box depth ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently on the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will appear ! ) .
space characters do not affect anything , but watch &amp; lt ; notes . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Resour@@ c@@ end@@ files be replaced .
the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file which serves to create context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; scripts would display the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of separate context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c simply by $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local and global usage . then create a folder ( as you specified it in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation to it .
if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation has been used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; repository for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; community . you will not be rich , but proud to have collabor@@ ated with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the different resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the Resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or anyone else . in different places there is an email menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D pack@@ et ( D@@ TE@@ P ) send with email , send tool@@ bar tool bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all the others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . we recommend that the contributions are checked and only available if our team uses them as correct and useful for publication . in order to make a contribution , we recommend using a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . this ensures the origin of the resources , both for our team and for later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for your private G@@ PG key after your pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the case that you have several keys , you can select one . enter the input fields ( URL preview can remain empty ) and start clicking OK to start up@@ loading .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , examine &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing . in case of problems , it warns and it can then be abor@@ ted . please read the warning messages carefully . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the specification of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages currently not yet by &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . however , creation can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in XML format . there is the easier way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D Load and Con@@ ver@@ ting a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D Description , which should be used . after that , the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
doc@@ type definition page : the string that should appear in ! doc@@ type tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand them and to get full benefit from and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze themselves with these fundamental concepts .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
global elements are available to anyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; everything that is marked globally is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to anyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns up to tool@@ bars with special promotions especially for the files of a particular project . simply stated , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ o@@ des the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the tree view , the tab@@ s with information and tool@@ bars . please consult , and for further information on these areas .
you can click the tab on the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as close the current , other or all tab , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CVS orders to the current document .
right @-@ clicking in the Editor area leads to a further context menu with respect to the processed document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , edit the tags under the mouse cur@@ sor , help the word under the mouse cur@@ sor , or open the file if the character string is called a file under the mouse cur@@ sor .
at the top end of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is displayed . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; paste ; insert into your document , then click on the tag that represents the tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as ar@@ mature ) , you can fill in a dialog several fields .
the tree views ( Q@@ IT ) make it possible to navigate in the information on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , open it and strip it . in the presentation with tab@@ s are available for files , project , templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view shows all the files in the project and allows administrators to manage the files in the project by right @-@ click . actions like addition , removal , up@@ loading or dele@@ tion of files from the storage media can be performed using the contex@@ tual menu that is then displayed .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; all possibilities are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used . global Tem@@ plates are always available , local templates are only usable for the respective users and templates in projects are only usable in the project .
here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . clicking with the left mouse button allows you to access the available information to a script . by clicking on the left mouse button , you can access the available information to a script .
with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking of an element , a list of commands opens in relation to the navigation and re@@ fres@@ her of the tree .
this tree appears under the other tree views . with it , it is possible to change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the entry system based on the content enables the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be added , edited and considered .
by default , &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two tab@@ s at the bottom of the window that can be accessed using useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . thus , for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are shown .
this tab shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensively expanded and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bars is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with email . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar archive by &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a tool@@ bar in an email , they can secure and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the configure script . auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help .
if you have problems with starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that there is no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PA@@ TH in front of her bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus started to deal with a obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then should &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this the suitable &amp; IDE ; be .
well , to the above claim must be noted that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; node ; developer community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good application of free software , the idea of Why develop what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; framework is not only this all possible but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs .
with self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation can be increased almost every task .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
for more details , go to help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and cared for by Eric L@@ aff@@ ett Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , but the oldest entry is removed .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . look into the section on templates . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project folder , only one error is reported .
when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board , converts special characters to &amp; HTML , so that they are displayed correctly and are not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instruction .
converts the text from cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ loop which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily used to insert &amp; URL ; s in anchor tag .
switches the block selection to or off . this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift ; select the key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful when your &amp; PHP ; script outputs error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre @-@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you see the display of script actions and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
extension of the del@@ im@@ porter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated as soon as you change to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a click of the mouse .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries Previous or Next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu group@@ ed according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are saved with file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows for example to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded further input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project is managed . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you will find the details .
load a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : locally or project .
open a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . it just creates the name . actions must be set by means of actions ... to be added . tool@@ bars will be saved using tool@@ bars tool@@ bars , or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . it doesn &apos;t delete it from the disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team so that the tool@@ bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as an attachment .
allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in .
loading a &amp; DT@@ D ; you or anyone else made and convert to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
loading / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P should be fresh@@ ened without renew@@ ing the entire &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not available , the load fails .
this menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard in the Tags menu , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current Day Settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
activ@@ ates and de@@ activ@@ ates the smart inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . past@@ ing by means of tool@@ bar if this tag contradic@@ ts the rules at this place .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plu@@ gins are listed under the menu items above . click on them . click on an activated plugin to de@@ activate it .
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the type ; version .
select the type of line @-@ ending identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms for development . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate change between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching may sometimes need time or create beautiful graphics . recommended is the flash@@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub @-@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub @-@ window . selecting an entry will activate the corresponding sub@@ window .
activ@@ ates the status bar display at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window on or off .
the changes in this dialog affect any application using the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
specify the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of posters ; see details .
a dialog appears where you delete entries from the tool@@ bars , or which can add and change the sequences .
this should create a help in accordance with the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter , but is not yet implemented .
&amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled up from top to bottom , because , for example , the entire directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically after filling out the project name . all these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift ; F@@ 7 project project features .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is filled in automatically .
this is the name of the project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ g.@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the setting of the remote host an adjustment might be necessary .
this is the folder in which the templates for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and default templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where tool@@ bars are saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to include files from the local fil@@ esystem into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . for server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
let it be checked if files located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included . if a project is started from scratch , not hooks .
with this option , all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an exact selection according to your own discretion .
this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the desired files by hook or , by removing the tick , clips from the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be up@@ loaded in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the sub@@ window profile or Shift ; F@@ 7 can be changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholders are possible ) , which are ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to top , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ Sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this means that the desired de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set using the Options button .
Up@@ load Pro@@ files can be used to set high @-@ load profiles ( see in ) , as well as the display of a tree view for each profile &apos;s content by cont@@ acting one &apos;s own tree view for each profile .
in the sub @-@ window team configuration project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can turn off event actions and add , modify or delete events . event actions are executed when a previously determined event occurs , such as securing a file . see the details .
by default , I open &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened . this behavior can not currently be influenced .
to open another project , select project open ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
when &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
folders behave as well , but the entries are missing opening and opening with ... in the context menu available with the right mouse button :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows you to remove the current profile . if only one profile exists , the button is da@@ zz@@ led to prevent the removal .
the password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten in the end of the program . this option is useful when frequent upload of files is necessary and the rather un@@ reliable password on the disk drive option is not in question .
this will stop the commit or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high @-@ load profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog appears :
this is the name of the server to which the files should be copied . either a full @-@ qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slave . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally , this does not need to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it after your discretion . the password is hidden on the disk , so it is not easy to read , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. by simply sw@@ apping the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be saved , opened or deleted from the Project or Project Tool@@ bar menu , accessible via settings tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to its own way of working .
as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus are best controlled using the tool@@ bar menu . use and Add differ . adding tool@@ bars will be processed at the bottom of the Add tool bar section .
the tool@@ bars and symbols on it can either be set using context menu ( right @-@ click on tool@@ bar ) , in which a new tool@@ bar can be created , other actions like tool@@ bars can be removed , tool@@ bars can be ren@@ ame or tool@@ bars run , which can be specified , what actions should be visible on these or other tool@@ bars .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will be removed and action edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings tool@@ bars ... and set settings actions .. set .
templates are basically document skel@@ et@@ ons , code cut@@ lets and files to connect . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used templates basically like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any directory existing to the system in the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
some with &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supplied templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions mentioned at the beginning of each template before use .
binary models are usually inserted in documents via links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates .
documents can be written from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . typically , more special documents are placed in corresponding sub@@ folders . you can easily sc@@ aff@@ old for the purpose and organize the work in an appropriate way to be efficient . some examples can be found in template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
this type of template is useful if not a new document based on a template , but the same text area should always be inserted in the documents . you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl basis . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole websites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
design a document structure as you like ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As Tem@@ plate As a local template ...
once this is done , note that ( even if it is stored as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look in the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File As Tem@@ plate save option as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be simply dra@@ gged with drag and drop on the tree view templates .
the creation of binary packages is simple : copy the file into a template folder . all file management functions can be used for it , such as dra@@ gging and dropping or past@@ ing through the Kon@@ quer@@ or file tree .
you can click on a folder right in the file tree or in the project file tree view and create a site template , enter a name for the template , and secure it . by default , it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates enable a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can pre@@ tend head@@ lines and foot@@ ers or dynamically add &amp; PHP ; design , paste or associate files with them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files laid in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each folder corresponds to one of four types of containers as explained above .
to specify the behavior of a folder , right @-@ click on the folder and select properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three types previously described ; files , text or templates .
if a root folder is set , it would generally disable templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder .
allows previous or custom text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project and allows to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers by copying content templates to a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a context menu ( show right mouse button ) over a complete command file to add folders or copy and paste templates from one place to another .
&amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; sourc@@ ec@@ ode editor which can be reached via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor . then you can edit and then switch back to source code editor where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document containing &amp; PHP ; a small green symbol indicates the absence of PHP ; -@@ Source . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; to edit , still the source editor is necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first one except that the changes are visible both in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor is synchron@@ ous in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor . with F@@ 9 , this mode is active , the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ke allows the active cur@@ sor from one window to another , maintaining the position in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source code editor can be set via Settings Qu@@ anta . when selecting V@@ PL , you can choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation is : a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so tools to choose document properties . thus editing of invisible tags in working with the V@@ PL ; editor is also called when a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is created . this will help reduce the manual coding . this can change the following :
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list allows changing the contents , e.g. keywords in the column names and keyword key word@@ 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS sty@@ ling template by pressing the file open button and selecting the appropriate file .
the use of the cur@@ sor is possible , as in word processing , by moving with the arrows . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves as usual . the text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted by typing and deleted using the back button or removed button .
inser@@ ting tags will be done in the same way across the tool@@ bars , as in the source code editor . it should be noted that inser@@ ting tags previously existing identical tags will not be removed , e.g. if an anchor tag , surrounded with text , must be removed any other surrounding anchor tag .
some tool@@ bars like the table assistant or the Listen directive are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release the tables or lists tool@@ bars must be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for examining style sheets . unlike other style templates , search for specific elements is possible and the style template can be traced .
at &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; to successfully compile , you need except &amp; k@@ de ; still libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already existing .
new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , orph@@ aned re@@ taining points can be set in a specific file and line number and subsequently activated .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without path . file names in the same folder as the top loaded style file file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g Is , for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l , the following input is possible :
in this command , a partial or entire agreement with a pre @-@ age named QNAP or a given type name is checked . &amp; eg ; template matches any QNAP &apos;s template that contains the template template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; is extended to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 is &amp; eg ; extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a desired stop point must be resolved for the corresponding UR@@ I and line number . this is done automatically when the first template is loaded by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . re@@ taining points are re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each iter@@ ation .

on systems with the installed Re@@ ad@@ line library , you can scroll through the arrow keys on / off by the sequ@@ encer of previously executed commands .
multiple commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to pass together expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; as argument a holding point is set in a file called &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; . &quot;

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts when merging .
the program I used showed only the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison windows .
a function that made a lot of work was the comparison and merging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a fully @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
this is useful when two people work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in this editor you can even edit the result directly . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen shot shows three source files when merging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when merging the folder :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and resist@@ s the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently need to check code , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side . ( no more anno@@ y@@ ance if someone changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is equal , and the other differs in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ .
if all files have the same name but are in different folders , you can make typing errors easier by just writing the file name of the first file . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 -@@ o destination folder
open dialog allows manual typing of file names , selecting from the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the opening dialog notes your selection and shows it next time . you don &apos;t need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences is done with two files .
using the Fol@@ der button ... you can also select a folder . if you choose a folder , the merge or merge of folders is initiated . if a file is selected for A , but a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A to the other folders .
when inter@@ acting is enabled , the input field is active for the target and can be edited . however , it is not necessarily necessary to set an output file immediately . you can do this step later when saving .
the set @-@ up button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start comparing / merging .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window .
you can also use drag &amp; drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
if you want to figure out how similar these functions are , it would be a fairly large effort . you only need to create two corresponding files , load them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; and then compare them . now you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you cannot extract it from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only dropping text into a comparison window will be supported .
warning : some editors interpret the dra@@ gging and dropping text into another program as cutting and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Every information line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest for a while over the line .
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these default settings can be changed using the Settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , you can see in the color which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files .
when differences are found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( in C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few rare cases . )
the vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no rows . if the line breaks is enabled , the line will be d@@ ashed to the broken lines .
the result window ( under the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the wor@@ ding output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Chan@@ ges &#93; when you edited the result . usually , it contains already text by automatic merging , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , the Save is gra@@ yed out ! ! ! ( use the sprin@@ kl@@ ink sprin@@ kler in the next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , every difference at the same time is also a conflict that needs to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group belonging to the row will be selected in all windows and the first row of the group will be displayed . ( this will also highlight a jump in the position in the windows where the group &apos;s beginning would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for the current area and on the left appears a black bar .
sometimes by automatic merging or manually editing , no more line is left in the group ; then in these lines the text &amp; lt ; No row in the file ; displayed . this is only a place holder for the case that you change your mind and maybe yet another source . this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a marker that you may copy and insert elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; merging conflicts ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board when you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : if selecting the sources ignor@@ es the options numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments enabled , changes in numbers or comments will also be treated as white characters .
navig@@ ates mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , side up , side down , end , end , strings start and string end , as you can also use it from other programs .
in the Au@@ ditions window , you can also use the other buttons for editing . with the inser@@ tion button , you can change between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the compilation and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous difference ( C@@ tr@@ l / C@@ tr@@ l image ) or to the next / previous conflict .
to copy the cli@@ p@@ board to the cli@@ p@@ board , you must copy the copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l In@@ sert ) . if this is enabled , whatever you mark is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board and the manual copying is om@@ itted .
line ends are stored according to the underlying OS . Unix versions use a line feed character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use cart reg@@ ression + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 does not keep the line ends of the source files , so you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using bin@@ aries .
the options and list of recently used files will be saved automatically during the ending and restored at the next start . ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 set up ... )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides variable width fon@@ ts , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , differences are displayed in ital@@ ics . if the selected script does not support this display , nothing happens at all .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors may not be available in their pure form , but would be model@@ ed .
if this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when the tab@@ ul@@ ator key is pressed . otherwise , a tab character will be inserted .
if you press input or return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
when this option is enabled , each selection will be automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . the manual copying to the cli@@ p@@ board is then om@@ itted .
you can select which line @-@ end type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used .
when comparing files try &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . in this step white characters are ignored . in this step white characters are ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a carriage return character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others save only one new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; . usually , the carriage returns are made visible , but then they might be treated like a white character .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters .
inten@@ sely search for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slow on very large files .
in the Automati@@ cally advanced mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will be inj@@ ected .
this is useful when white characters are less important in many files . if you only need this from time to time , then use better the functions Select A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the Automatic Sel@@ ection also affects numbers or comments when the options are ignor@@ ing numbers or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments enabled .
these options are dealt with in chapter to scan folders and perform merging . see for details in documentation about the comparison and merging .
if a file is saved and already an older version exists , then the original version is app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you need to quit and restart , so that the change becomes active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally across the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting will be used for all entries .
over the selection fields for coding a short notice appears what the local coding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . as the coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different encoding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding should be used for saving .
if you define pre@@ processor commands , they might not work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre@@ processor command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII ) .
turn off this to supp@@ ress changes in white characters in text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignor@@ ing numbers or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments enabled . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are shown in a color coded over@@ sight column . but sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files .
sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply select the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you look at the differences and then decide to merge the files . merging the current file in the merge menu will also work if you only compare two files . ( if this function is used to restart the merge operation , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that fits exactly your needs . you can use this feature , for example , to cut out disturbing parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when a file is read , it is passed to this external command first . if a normal pre@@ processor command is also specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this pre@@ processor command . you can write your own pre@@ processor that fits exactly your needs . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users don &apos;t want to program it by themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l completely suff@@ ice .

while you are experim@@ enting with sed , you might start to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre @-@ processing command for line devi@@ ations . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing , so virtually deleted .
sometimes you may want to perform several sub@@ stitu@@ tions at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the sub@@ stitu@@ tions from each other . example :
instead of sed you can also use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever some details are different from per@@ l . where used \ \ ( and \ \ ) is needed per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor are retained for display and merging . the other operations only change the data that the new@@ line algorithm looks like .
note : in rare cases when using a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often program@@ mers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare &amp; merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively and merge .
... makes a suggestion for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before starting ,
... can simulate the merge and show the simulated changes without actually performing them ,
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and merging single files . you just need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog File .
if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder is specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not the merge . to start the merge , you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . )
while reading the folder , you will be informed of a little news window about the current progress . if you cancel the scan of the folders , only the files that were compared until then will be listed .
when the scan of the folder is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple click of the mouse .
the folder structure is normally folded up . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - or double @-@ clicking on the object or by using the arrow keys for left / right .
when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears .
the symbol in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the A / B / C columns and the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be automatically selected . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this kind again .
as shown in the picture above , colours red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns .
with identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered identical if their entire contents are identical . then , folders also have the same color . in folders , age is irrelevant for its color .
the idea to this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green then yellow and later when it is old , red becomes .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faulty objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faulty objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
the mode to synchron@@ ize is active if only two folders and no explicit destination folder have been specified and if the option directory is synchron@@ ized . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that afterwards both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but are not identical : merge and store the result in both folders . ( the user sees only B ; copied directly after merging &amp; cl@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge ( unsure ) then check &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files , but the same date will appear error : files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ler such errors are not fixed , the merge of the folders cannot be started .
when merging , one file is executed after the other . the status column displays finished when the merge is successful , and correspon@@ d@@ ingly different messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right .
if in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full Analysis , K@@ diff@@ 3 will display more columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at one time . if you have selected all the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge operation .
please note : if you have no destination folder , then in the Three @-@ Fol@@ der @-@ Mer@@ ge mode C is used as the destination , in the two @-@ folder merge , B is chosen as the target and when syn@@ cing , A and / or B will be used as a target .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries should be in the destination folder , also in the folder structure . there are some options that may be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the list menu , or press F@@ 7 ( the key short@@ cut ) . to merge only the current element : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid merge actions , a message appears which indicates incorrect elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog box appears with the options Browse , Sim@@ ulate and Canc@@ el .
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then perform certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) then a merge window opens ( note the screen shot ) .
when you are finished with a file , select / continue directory merge again , or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog appears . then proceed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work continues with the next entry .
if you encounter a mistake , a message and detailed status information appears . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you select the cause of the problem . if you continue merging ( F@@ 7 key ) , you will have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in a different way before proceeding .
if some entries have been merged individually , notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and do not merge them together later . even if the merge operation has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered complete . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Set Settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files matching the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be typ@@ ed more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be typ@@ ed more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder @-@ specific file can be set with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a hiding attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a previous point is selected as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled by default .
if the option is switched on , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files are compared to which the links are shown . this is de@@ activated by default .
if the option is turned on , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ) will not be checked for possible recur@@ sions .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statisti@@ c columns . ( the number of dissolved , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders using a slow network , it may be quicker to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage costs you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is switched off by default .
similar to Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al the Date of Change . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal . this can be useful , for example , when copying the change date . please use caution . this option is switched off by default .
enable the synchron@@ ize mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for merging are selected in such a way that afterwards both folders are identical . the results of merging files are stored in both folders .
if there are differences , instead of merging the newer file is suggested as an action . ( this is considered in@@ secure because the knowledge assumes that the other file has not been modified too . you should check this in any case . ) This option is switched off in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version will be renamed and the extension .@@ orig@@ . When an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , it will be deleted without further backup . this also applies to normal merging of individual files , not only the merging of entire folders . this option is enabled by default .
normally the merge @-@ merge view remains visible to merge individual files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can switch the main window in the pop @-@ up menu and switch between the two views by changing between directory &amp; text window .
you probably prefer to compare a file by double @-@ clicking . however , there is a corresponding menu entry in the directory menu . you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge . once you save the result , the status will be reset and the file will not merge again if you start the folder merge .
however , this status is lost when you re @-@ read the directory : directory menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open files located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file to an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . you should note a few things :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. contain . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # contains the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes because of the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . there is a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then a file is always assumed as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or modification date . therefore , the per@@ missions or the modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the confidentiality of the size . ) ( This is only possible for local files . )
the main purpose is currently the difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P . K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P first always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button over the difference viewer and then select In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part from the contex@@ tual menu .
usually needed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is used as a K@@ part , it accepts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program will start to recover the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select Pre@@ view in - K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part from the Pre@@ view menu . please note that this does not work if there is no original file . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the creation of the patch file .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; runs as part , it only supports comparing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now there are compact ) exist already . in addition , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge like the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff Tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs very long and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all program@@ mers who have gone this way or are going to go that way .
you compiled the program from the sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script to K@@ DE . in default configure installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . if similar lines appear next to each other , this is is often the case .
the editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information .
the effort for this has been too big so far . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c has been left ; no sr@@ c has been released ; and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and mis@@ use the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information about how to use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
you can find a list of the latest changes at ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source package .
to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir returns the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
as &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have problems with comp@@ iling . if you still encounter difficulties , please write to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Mail@@ ing@@ lists of it .
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) copy to the cli@@ p@@ board and delete the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift @-@ In@@ sert ) inserts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position and replaces the current selection .
only show differences : files identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder .
( in the current program version , you need to re @-@ read the folder with the update after changes to these options . )
this also means that identical files will not be copied to the target folder when merging . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after the merge operation . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default .
note the buttons to select the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines are attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed when you click the button .
in default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displays a miniature preview of all virtual work@@ spaces . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the working surfaces , change their size , finish them or move them .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ spaces as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a working area and on other working areas .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked on the empty Back@@ ground of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries Minim@@ ize , Maxim@@ ize , On Desktop and Be@@ am . the commands do the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected Virtual Desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also moved to other working areas .
if this field is enabled , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the names of the virtual work@@ spaces are displayed .
tick this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual work@@ spaces . if it is enabled along with name , the names are provided with ord@@ inal numbers , eg . 1 . desktop .
if this field is enabled , the background of each desktop is also displayed as a background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displayed .
if this field is enabled , the running programs will be displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty working areas will be displayed to enable their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simple shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the windows with their default icon and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is recommended for very fast systems only .
here the arrangement of the main window can be determined : classi@@ cally lets &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid , like from p@@ ager applications in some other Windows managers , horizont@@ ally displays all virtual work@@ spaces in a horizontal and vertical row , which is very good for displaying later@@ ally on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display and move the windows as symbols or with its contents . besides , it runs outside the control bar .
right click within &amp; p@@ ager ; and then set up switch settings ... let the dialog appear settings .
at the moment it is not possible to change the settings in the dialog . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or turn to your system administrator .

&amp; K@@ mag ; is a screen saver . you can zoom a part of the screen , as if you read a magni@@ fying glass for the print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , web designers and people with visual impairment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; K@@ mag ; be .
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended with new features . it is optimized for use on powerful computers .
when you start &amp; K@@ mag , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window is referred to as magni@@ fying window .. the image shown in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window .
the default setting is enlarged &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse cur@@ sor is like a mo@@ ve@@ able magni@@ fier . alternatively , you may select a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( select window mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid the mouse cur@@ sor being displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse cur@@ sor setting . please note that the mouse poin@@ ter is still not able to detect the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default node ; / Q@@ t ; mouse cur@@ sor .
in the drop @-@ down mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this also works with the arrow keys .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you press the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Shift &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button or press the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this combination you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window remains fixed and only the bottom right corner is to move .
&amp; K@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the picture and much more .
start or stop the ad update . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go to 0 .
select the update rate ( very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your configured short commands to store files , open a new window , print , rel@@ o@@ ad ( with the button File again in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and reduce &amp; etc ; .
K@@ mag is also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a screen magni@@ fier . you can use &amp; magni@@ fier ; to use an area of the screen , as if you were using a magni@@ fier to view the print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visual han@@ dicapped .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor remains on the same spot . it is meant to help people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury Syndrome ) and which each mouse click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click when the mouse cur@@ sor is waiting for a while on the same spot . it is meant to help people who suffer from the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) Syndrome and which each mouse click causes pain .
and k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can b@@ ypass the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helping so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , pain may also be caused by the use of your computer . if you suffer from pain associated with your computer , you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet .
to make it clear again : even though &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , avoid pain caused by moving the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; c@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click as soon as you stop the movement briefly .
the smart move activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the release of the mouse button is running . in this way , you can drag the mouse button with pressed mouse button . in this way , you can drag the mouse with pressed mouse button . the smart shift requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before and k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click .
if Intel@@ lig@@ ator is switched on , the shooting time is activated ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the &amp; c@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button , wait before releasing the mouse button again , if no moving of the mouse is in the meantime .
this function activ@@ ates a slow moving to the right and back followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . these movements are saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later .
if the sound appears delayed , you can reduce the response time . to do so , go to the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose Sound System , and here the Ri@@ der General . there is a slider called Sound Buff@@ ers , which you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; this function is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de ; for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically .
reset all settings to the values set when you open the dialog . if you have already pressed the Apply button , the settings will be reset to the user after the last push of the user .
the best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , the smart move should be turned off first . if you then get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later accept the smart move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response time of &amp; k@@ de ; for sounds .
first , you should be aware of which places a click of a mouse remains without effect : clicking on the neutral parts of windows or in the browser window that does not display a link does not result in unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use them again .
when your mouse clicks , you should clean your mouse . it &apos;s usually pretty simple . the trick is that you don &apos;t just clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you have to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different , but it should be clear if you take a look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . you can scra@@ pe the dirt and dirt with a flat blade or finger nail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are using the smart move , that means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation no longer can end by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can execute a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; you can continue to work as usual .
problem : if you type text , try &amp; c@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute the mouse clicks and set the cur@@ sor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor to where you want it . however , you can use the mouse on a neutral zone of the desktop if you want to have a keyboard input .
I try to work with smart moving , but I don &apos;t manage to edit lyrics .
the smart shift is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time before you can handle it . it is very likely possible in this way to copy text , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board , or execute any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button .
do not use the smart move if you just begin to use it &amp; c@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select a mou@@ sec@@ lick at one end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and hold the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . as a result , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the shifting time starts with smart moving . later you can use the smart move even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some exercise .
in order to be able to use the X@@ Test @-@ extension for &amp; X Window ; this should be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and loudspeaker , and these are properly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pressed the mouse button briefly as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter persi@@ sts . this program has been developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome , which causes pain in the mouth .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to wait a certain time for a drag operation to start before releasing the mouse button . in this way , drag and drop down with the mouse can be performed .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that allows silent users to talk to their computer .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; mu@@ te users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation history to be repeated again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) , enter the command that will be used later for the voice output of text . for more details , see the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page you can choose the default text passage . from the text passages you can select frequently used text passages without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screen@@ shot ) , you determine the dictionary for word completion . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the selected language to determine the frequency of each word . in addition , you can offset the word@@ lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be included in the words .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen shot ) and a sequ@@ encer of the already spoken phrases ( the upper white field in the screen shot ) .
if you have k@@ mouth ; correctly set up , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken word is attached to the default memory . you can select phrases that are to be repeated .
with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the word vocabulary and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; box &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; input field , enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection box below the input field , specify the character encoding , with the text transmitted to the voice generator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on as standard input to the voice generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as parameters . you can use the following wild@@ cards :
of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation to your language generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
when it is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . if that is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a standardized interface for voice output and is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first drop @-@ down sel@@ ector action after selecting a passage of text , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the Text Mis@@ say@@ ist menu or in the bar for text passages .
the chosen text passage is directly spoken with the selection of In the input field . with the selection of In the input field , the chosen text passage is entered only into the input field .
the second drop @-@ down box allows you to set the edit window to be saved automatically when closing the editing window .
when you choose to make changes , the text entry will not be saved . select before saving , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if you want to save the text passage .
in the main window next to the input field , &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection panel when this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection box , you can select the currently used dictionary for word completion .
using the buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file .
for this source choose the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of the individual words is simply determined by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged and how they are to be wei@@ ghted .
with this option you create a new , empty dictionary with no entries . da &amp; K@@ mouth ; newly set words automatically add to the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time .
the main area of the window for editing text passages is split . in the upper part , the text passages are represented as tree structure .
in the lower part , you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage , you can only change its name .
you can add actions such as new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books either through the selection in the menu bar , the tool@@ bar , or via a drop @-@ down menu .
you can change the order of text passages or text passages by dra@@ gging the mouse to the new location or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected portions of the default storage .
the selected text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected portions of the default storage .
the currently active proposition is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected pro@@ positions of the sequ@@ encer .
if this menu entry is enabled , a sliding tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by default , the tool@@ bar is placed directly under the menu bar via the editing window . by clicking on the hat@@ ch left side and drawing , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place .
if this menu entry is enabled , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with information about the state of &amp; mouth ; displayed if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is selected , a sliding bar is displayed for text passages with entries . by default , the bar is placed directly under the tool@@ bar via the editing window . by clicking on the hat@@ ch left side and drawing , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place .
you probably have not entered the command for voice output properly or not completely . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the page General Settings and enter the command for voice output on the map file . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . )
festival is a voice @-@ over@@ s system of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows you to use the festival free of charge and without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder .
Free@@ T@@ TS is a language generator written in &amp; Java . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows Free@@ T@@ TS to be used free of charge and without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ tet folder . the speech output is then possible with one of the following command examples :
for the third example , the option must be enabled as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the use of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA is a voice generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed file , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately Ha@@ di@@ fax likes to swallow the last character of the text , so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the full command is more complex than in the other examples :
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / host@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ e / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as default input must be enabled .
the voice output da@@ emon by &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
since the setting of the language generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use frac@@ t@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; to use it successfully , you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application that allows people who cannot talk about leaving text by computer . a list of already spoken phrases is stored , which the user can re@@ charge repeatedly .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language syn@@ thesizer ; a speech syn@@ thesizer must be installed on the computer .
more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( either enter this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter or start k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service that allows any application to read text about the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programmer , with which their applications can be equipped with T@@ TS capability .
reading texts ( or parts of it ) in the text editor &amp; kate ; , even if &amp; # ; in other parts ; applications embedded .
the speech output is controlled by the speech @-@ dispens@@ er program , which uses various background program such as es@@ peak , festival , etc .
allows to generate voice output on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; utility program .
Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Met@@ a @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the voice output service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible windows that offers T@@ TS services via &amp; d@@ bus ;
an application with &amp; GUI ; to configure and setup kt@@ ts@@ d over kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a web page or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor &amp; kate ; with which a text file can be read completely or partially .
in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa Database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) , you can find the list via ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ accessibility .
before you can use cookies , you need to install and correctly set the speech @-@ to @-@ date software .
when you first launch kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card card speaker will be displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the card card general will be displayed .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , such as different male or female ones , or those that differ in volume or speed . they can also set up several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . a well @-@ equipped combination of speech , syn@@ thesizer , voice , sex , volume and speed is called a speaker .
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printer lengths for the same printer .
if you click on the card leader narr@@ ator in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card card speaker will be displayed . this will appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and has not yet been set up .
all already established speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear in the list above . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not give a speaker .
select a speaker from the list with a click of the mouse and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a speaker from the list with a click of the mouse and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select a speaker from the list with a click of the mouse and click on this button to add a line to the speaker in the list . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ v ; system .
select a type of pitch , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girl &apos;s voice to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the card card speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can almost use it . go back to the card information General and check if Voice Output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) to enable the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ats ; click on the map order to create and manage text orders . see .
if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the voice output system from &amp; k@@ de ; click the tab labeled General to open this map . here you can set some general options .
select this check box to activate the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card order will be displayed , and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the mark , K@@ TT@@ SD is stopped and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
when kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr stops , runs &amp; kt@@ ops ; next , if the box activation is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will appear automatically in the control bar when read , it disappears again as soon as the reading is finished .
with the buttons in this row , you can start , cancel , pause , and resume text orders .
with the buttons in this row , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board or open a text file to read it . you can also change the speaker for an order .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all sides .
the card order is only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab and tick the voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . first check if &amp; kt@@ ats ; then select the text read before , and select text in the main menu .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can skip this step too , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre@@ amps and other invisible marks are also read .
in &amp; Plac@@ ement ; the advanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text displayed . then check if &amp; kt@@ ats ; then select the text read before , and select text in the main menu . then the speech output should start .
this also works when &amp; plac@@ ards ; embedded in other applications such as eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ notification is the message system of &amp; k@@ de ; that informs you about events specified by you . you can also read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ats ; read more .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up various types of messages . for example , set up so that you will be notified when a message appears in an I@@ RC channel where your nick@@ name appears . with &amp; kt@@ ats ; you can then read the I@@ RC message text .
support a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ notification , a menu entry appears in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ notification are different depending on the application .
the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is part of the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as pres@@ upp@@ osed .
filters are one of the advanced features of &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required for normal work .
in filters , text is processed before being sent to the speech @-@ speech @-@ dispens@@ er . they are useful for improving pron@@ unci@@ ation , to substitute false spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker or to circum@@ vent certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand the way filters work , it is important to know how the &quot; speech @-@ dispens@@ er &quot; program works with a text . &amp; quot ; distinguishes four types of text .
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these jobs . once the output of the screen reader is read , the pending jobs will be resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after the issue of the warning .
messages have the next highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you are reading a long text on a web page , you can chat with &amp; k@@ mouth ; messages are also messages .
the rest are simple text orders . every order you tap from the card card is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are meant for the output of longer texts , which have no particular ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queu@@ es except Screen Re@@ aders output . when an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ats ; just one such reading , this output is stopped and terminated .
first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filters process the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future , there can still be more types of filters .
replacing parts of a text with other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; quot ; is supplied with pre@@ defined string replacement filters , which allow the creation of chat @-@ emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for reform@@ at@@ ting messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable way .
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert XML ; from one format to another format . in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in S@@ Sm@@ l .
with subscri@@ ber selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or the program that has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . for example , if you have inserted a female voice on the map sheet speaker , you can read the text of K@@ DE messages about it .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied for a voice output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , the text remains unchanged to the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification is sent , it is processed by all activated filters installed on the bottom of the page . processing by the filters takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the established normal filters . if a filter is not selected , it is not checked and is not used .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the further below setup di@@ alogs are displayed .
you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern to set up a string asser@@ tion filter . if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be replaced with the corresponding replacement text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it only has to differ from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string from the Er@@ set column . the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom .
click here to move the marked word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries from the file are attached to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter is applied only if the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button at the click of the button .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied only if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID of running programs is provided with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may only enter copied .
the string asser@@ tion filter is applied to the text only if all the conditions correspond to an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if all the input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
in comparison of words , the string replace filter uses regular expressions in the \ \ s word \ \ s . so , the words must be limited on both sides by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) .
in this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . but if you have installed the &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the package k@@ ambig@@ u@@ els .
XML ; Trans@@ former transl@@ ating &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from one format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such transform@@ ations . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the PA@@ TH environment variable , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is also sufficient .
with the speaker cho@@ oser filter , you can send text to a particular speaker set up on the card &apos;s card speaker or to a speaker with certain properties . for example , you can set the texts by k@@ mail to be read by a female voice .
before writing a text to the filter , it is looking for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker characteristics that the program performs , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the characteristics of the speakers appointed on the map board .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . if on your system of the &amp; node ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions , you can call it by clicking on the button to get help in the input .
to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the characteristics of the speaker you are looking for . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker will be selected to meet the desired requirements .
use these buttons to save or load your speech settings , or to delete all settings .
the subscri@@ ber selection filter will only be applied to the text when all conditions with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter apply if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .

none of the mentioned speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Form@@ er filter , but when using the module for festival websites , websites are not read .
due to an error in festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone to enable S@@ able to work at all . you must do this yourself if you do not use this voice for reading web pages . also , make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the PA@@ TH environment variable .
certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors when syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ish is issued . what can I do about it ?
first , make sure that the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be fixed by a string asser@@ tion filter .

American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ il@@ i , Zul@@ u and Ibiza .
K@@ T@@ TS also works with any language syn@@ thesizer based on command line in a console .
the list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , consult the description of the syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to the supported languages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ dispens@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program uses a customizable module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to extend the use of a different syn@@ thesizer , contact the developer team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c User Language program is used to support S@@ Sm@@ l and for the &amp; XML conversion filter , but is not necessarily required . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including packages of k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ dispens@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; source code from the source code archive , or download the tar@@ ball that is currently created every night , and install the program with the following commands :
before you use cookies , first verify that the speech syn@@ thesizer works correctly with your speech syn@@ thesizer . to do so , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; quot ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ats ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr will be developed in such a way that the set @-@ up of speech @-@ dispens@@ er is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is broken down into individual sentences . the user can leave a set or paragraph , repeat , pause or cancel the output .
for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose gender is feminine , this will be used , otherwise the best matching speaker will be selected automatically . if you want to learn more about it , like &amp; kt@@ ats ; select a speaker , look in .
if you click Add to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the card &apos;s card speaker setup will be displayed . as an example , the module &apos;s setup for Festival Interactive will be shown below . you will find details of the modules below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival in PA@@ TH is included , you just have to enter the festival .
select the character encoding for text that is passed to the festival . in Vo@@ ices , the &amp; kt@@ ats ; known , this setting will be done automatically . in general , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages like Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these slider controls , you set the volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some controllers and display this grey , the voice you select does not allow these settings .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require several seconds to be loaded because of their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that ( with larger memory consumption ) the first set will be syn@@ thes@@ ized faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not set up a speaker ( or click Apply . ) .
if this check box is selected , at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr the program window is displayed kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the symbol t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section is visible , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is not running yet , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . thus , you have the possibility to stop reading or otherwise control .
here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently edited pack .
with the buttons in this row , you can proceed or reset in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK , all changes to the settings ( also on the other cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be res@@ ized to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click the Audio card Audio . see also .
here , only text orders are listed and managed . outputs of screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . for more information about the message types of kt@@ ats ; see in .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , it has been dis@@ assembled , either with no support for the corresponding audio module , or you can &apos;t load the required libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are shown in the list , you must install at least one module . if you choose AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the speech speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ 1- ; % approximately the double normal speaking speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click Apply to take over the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ v ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you must find out which device works with you . in case of doubt choose standard .
on this map , you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a higher priority message . &amp; quot ; handles four types of speech applications :
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these jobs . once the output of the screen reader has been read , the pending jobs are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor becomes too hot . a warning will keep the output of messages and normal text . these orders will resume after reading the warning .
messages have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you are looking for a long text on a website , you can get with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who just enters the room .
if a text message is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , add &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output in the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both the introduc@@ tory sound and the introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the incoming message .
the settings on this map are only valid for normal text orders . for messages , warnings and the output of screen readers , there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ats ; to read K@@ notification messages , launch kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click Noti@@ fications . the card card Noti@@ fications appears .
select this check box to enable the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; if this setting is not selected , the other settings are down@@ lighted and &amp; kt@@ ops ; do not read al@@ erts .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played are not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone in an I@@ RC message men@@ tions your nick@@ name .
all events for which nothing else is indicated in the list are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ats ; ignored .
use this selection box to specify what to do ; when an event occurs , you have the following choices :
if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the text you want . you can use the following wild@@ cards :
you can enter here the properties of the desired speaker . standard chooses the speaker that appears in the list on the map sheet speaker as top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application .
the All noti@@ fications for the Application default ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can set the default noti@@ fications as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for the messages in a file . use the button to load saved settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except All Noti@@ fications will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( S@@ Sm@@ l ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains trademarks for controlling voices , speaking speed , volume , sex of voice and pitch .
currently support &amp; t@@ ts ; S@@ Sm@@ l only partially and only in basic functions . the following limitations are available :
you have to install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone ( British ) voice , since this is the default voice , the festival is used at the S@@ Sm@@ l edition .
if settings for speed or sound are not set to 100 % in the Festival configuration dialog , S@@ Sm@@ l text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filters ( SD@@ B filter ) . S@@ B@@ Ds divide text into individual phrases . this way you can start with the preview , since only the first set has to be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text order .
here you see the set @-@ limit recognition filter . at the first start of the set , a set limit recognition filter is set up automatically . you can change its settings or add additional set @-@ limit recognition filters , but beginners will be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
the easiest way to do this is to try setting up the speaker selection by trying . switch off the speaker selection and enter text to read . switch off the speaker selection , change some properties and check how the speaker &apos;s selection changes . of course , you have to have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then you can start reading faster , since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole block of text , which can last very long ,
if the voice syn@@ thesizer doesn &apos;t support this feature , you can set up text orders on the card file .
for these reasons , the normal set @-@ limit recognition filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything in this filter unless you know what you are doing .
pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters match text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and add a tab@@ ul@@ ator sign ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) at the set limits . note that the standard set @-@ limit recognition filter retains the character set .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ notify ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen re@@ actors .
if you have removed the normal set @-@ limit identi@@ fier , you can insert it again by loading the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c contained in &amp; kt@@ ts ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can over@@ ride the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spe@@ aker settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the application on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spe@@ akers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu . &quot; &quot; &quot;
use of the default speaker ( the top one on the card card speaker ) . in other words , no speaking properties are specified .

select the method to enter the desired speech properties by clicking on one of the buttons .
select the properties of the speaker you want . if this feature doesn &apos;t matter , do not enter anything .
select this check box if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also set several markings here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as a primary feature . you will rarely use this feature . the only case you may want to specify the attribute language is before , if you know that a particular application sends text in another language than that set in the working environment .
to use all the features in the speaker area , which is most likely to delete the following , click the default speaker to use and then use the speaker , which is closest to the following .
in this case , 0 for the last text order is in the queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without the order number , enter 0 is required ) .

festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported .
you need to install at least one language . help is provided in the instructions provided with festival . if you want to read websites , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing .
the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software in festival / lib / vo@@ l / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you have to enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . choose a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . please search for the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option code must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival can be used together with the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; syn@@ thesizer . then festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ical analysis and &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; generates the audio output . the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; not a complete voice output system . &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from phone files . you need additional software to create this phone . festival generates this from &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce from German text di@@ phone .
in this procedure additional wra@@ pper code is added to the festival to use &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; voice synthesis voices . note that the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; folders are installed , but in the folder Festival / lib / . instructions can be found under

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; which allows the administration of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K Menu c@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; -@@ package is designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings will be displayed in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to allow &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all displays and allows setting of network properties .
in most cases , drivers for the network hardware and other devices will be installed and installed when installing and installing . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files according to the kernel version :
the Network Set@@ ting module is loaded when the Network Set@@ ting option is selected in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; index selected . when starting the module network settings , this will try to automatically detect the used platform on the system .
if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which is best suited to distribution and rel@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and . by marking the setting Not @-@ again , the definition can be taken permanently . at the next start of the network settings , this selection will be set automatically .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . before , all options are displayed gray , which means the settings can only be viewed , the change is not possible .
in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three tab@@ s :
the Network Interface Panel is used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the Ri@@ der Network Interface :
the settings of the network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... set up in the dialog device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options .
with the automatic selection , TCP / IP settings are taken from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system are also made with the start of the system services . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information at each system start , so no further setting is required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system , can be selected .
with the selection Manual , the TCP / IP configuration can be made without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the IP address field , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled .
the values entered in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; kon@@ sole , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off as required . switching on a switched @-@ off network device is enabled by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
network devices can be activated or switched off as required . switching off an activated network device can be de@@ activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
defines the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net that con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communications with computers in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface to the network where the gateway computer is located must be selected .
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the host calls ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS will resolve this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution part of the name resolution part of the name resolution makes it easy to manage this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records can be sorted by selecting an entry and / or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the button Hin@@ der or Her@@ under .
by clicking the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog .
first , enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be added to the list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; select an entry from the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; name resolution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and click the Edit button ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list name commonly known calcul@@ ator describes host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP ad@@ ress for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used when bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , shut @-@ off networks , it can replace DNS server .
usually the list includes some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this version of IP is still to be replaced in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the familiar host@@ name and click Add .... Add the New Ali@@ as dialog will appear .
enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button . if the well known computer has multiple alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a name known by name from the list and select Edit .... This dialog will be displayed .
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the network settings are not effective immediately in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command must be set in a &amp; Con@@ sole .
the web site of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , which allows you to download the latest version of the source code .
for installing the binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) , it is sufficient if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the ready @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution can be used .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; but in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and other things .
this is recommended only by experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile and compile ; the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be given , and in the second section all of the configuration files will be discussed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf .
this section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC is conveyed into a small ( home ) network .
IP networks are currently run with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found widespread dis@@ sem@@ ination . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to be implemented in the near future . therefore , this description is currently focusing on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is to be assigned . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; work@@ station , the network administrator can use a valid IP address or , if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address can not be chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from an area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , therefore its use is possible .
of course , the access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateway .
for smaller networks , addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are mostly used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own computer ) . the default route is required for the IP for@@ warding .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
this section contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf and where they are stored in the distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes changed dynamically with DSL connections so it is not surprised if there is another content to be found there in case of active DSL connections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ SE &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is known that this file is dropped by the scripts in Su@@ SE config . &quot; &quot; &quot;

if everything goes smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive will change to indicate that the tape has been incorporated . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched by fl@@ aps of the entry for the tape .
before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be resolved . there are three methods to achieve this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; indicated by modi@@ fying the symbol for the tape , that the integration for the tape has been resolved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without any danger .
before a tape of &amp; dat can be used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; dat .
a band type must be format@@ ted before you can use it to store data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting by &amp; k@@ dat ; . does your tape drive require format@@ ting before use . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually require format@@ ting the tape , while DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the band name and capacity , the tape continues and the tape is format@@ ted . all data on the tape is lost ! after the format@@ ting process is finished , the tape is automatically integrated and ready for use .
before you initiate the backup process , you must select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be backed up .
select a safety profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
ri@@ ght@@ click on the local file tree and select the Save ...
once the backup is initiated , the dialog opens settings for backup . in this dialog , you can review the selected files once again and change the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog box appears . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a check . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
ri@@ ght@@ click in any of the archives and select the menu entry ...
once the check@@ out process has been started , the dialog appears for review . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for review .
when you confirm the verification , the dialog appears . this dialog displays the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before initi@@ ating the restore , the files to be recovered must be selected . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive entry . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a check box . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore ....
once the restore process has been started , the dialog appears for recovery . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for recovery .
when you confirm the settings for restoration , the dialog appears again . this dialog displays the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it is necessary to recre@@ ate the tape inde@@ x@@ file based on the band content . this process cle@@ ars all existing index files for this tape . you can re@@ construct the index in two ways :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current work folder where the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected work folder .
for all the files listed in backup files , only the files in it are backed up on the same fil@@ esystem , such as the folder . folders that are located on other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be separated into backup files separately . each entry is considered by tar independently from the others .
to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up .
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; &amp; lt ; files was not yet fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set the settings via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape device .
if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; stat@@ dat ; before the tape is involved , the command will load to the drive . for some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed .
if the option is turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; to block the ej@@ ection of the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work on all tape drives .
if the option is turned on , when resol@@ ving the integration of &amp; dat , the tape will be ej@@ ected automatically . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ war@@ y block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you must inform &amp; dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drive .
if a tape is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only show a block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows :
( n by@@ te ) The band ID . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time when the tape was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system handles the different protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users access to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer does in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system handles the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; tries to provide some advanced features that can be used to filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . this includes among other things :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available to easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after startup trying &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; initially , the main protocol file of the system - the system log - is not displayed , and it opens instead of a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; most likely not with system administrator privileges . the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the folder / var / log , for normal users usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion or after specified strings . in addition , the list of the log lines will be changed automatically , so only log lines will be displayed next to the filter . in the default setting , a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns .
you can also select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term will then only be matched with entries in the corresponding column . for example , in the protocol file system protocol , select the process name , and then , in the filter bar , enter the name of a process , so show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more eye @-@ catching color as protocol lines of level hint . the colored display of protocol lines can be turned off setup dialog .
if you just want to show a specific process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the process column . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use the filter bar .
in addition , you can activate the Add to new lines in the main window context menu to view all the new protocol lines added .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows you to view multiple protocol files in separate sub windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website at ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find more current information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .

welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; system V in@@ it editor , rather known ( and also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
the system V in@@ it is rapidly becoming the standard for checking the system starts when running the system in the &amp; Linux ; this is because it is easier to use , more powerful , and more flexible than the traditional BSD @-@ In@@ it .
I won &apos;t go into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because perhaps someone might attempt to switch a machine to System V in@@ it without re@@ installing and reform@@ at@@ ting . the &amp; Linux ; kernel first looks under / etc after an in@@ it file . therefore , you must make sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V in@@ it differs also from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following folders :
system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc ; system services , on the other hand , do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls are to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is actually no use of it . you can also run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port .
the kernel searches for in@@ it in several places and starts the first one that it finds .
the standard run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . in the beginning area you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change this then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab manually and change the 3 . if you have mess@@ ed up something , then you come to repair it by rest@@ art@@ ing the system and exec@@ uting the following :
but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you &apos;ll probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it system services ? quite simply : each of the scripts is written so that it accepts an argument such as start and stop . you can actually start these scripts from manually on the command line as follows :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it includes a K , the script will be called with the argument stop . if it includes an S , the script will be called with the start argument .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server run@@ level that runs only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; also , I could also have a user run@@ level , that &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you can learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult , because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or any other pointing device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six running level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts around Run@@ level@@ n or change the position within a level by pulling it elsewhere . this will only happen if they pull out an entry from the range of available system services .
note : entries are moved when you drag them into a new area . to simply copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select Cop@@ y from the Edit menu or from the contex@@ tual menu and insert it into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action .
the sor@@ ter number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service .
note : currently there is no way to restore entries that have been put into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab key to activate the different working areas ( Avail@@ able System Services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to move an entry into another running level , move it to cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ level ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sor@@ ter number or the name of an entry manually , press the button to open the properties dialog . use the tab@@ ul@@ ator button to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to reject the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are removed from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if available . otherwise , they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings are saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I experim@@ ented with the standard @-@ level@@ ing , and now the machine is constantly rest@@ art@@ ing . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO prompt in lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the standard running level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be ok ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for exec@@ uting under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the way system services are launched in these distri@@ butions will simplify the configuration for the proprietary implementation programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution , please check that all configuration files are available , which are required by the system service ( and also , if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) just end without a message if their configuration files are not present or incor@@ rectly set up .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , may even be different from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that you can attach it to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the section adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; read .
after you have made changes , you must save them . either use the corresponding symbol of the tool@@ bar or the Save in the File menu .
the main window consists of two flash@@ cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears the user / group properties dialog .
some card cards are only displayed when you have advanced system settings . only when you activate space limitations ( quota ) for users will create a map that allows you to customize individual settings . other cards appear , if shadow passwords , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD UNIX .
the password management card card appears , if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD environments .
this card only appears if for at least one fil@@ esystem space limitation ( quota ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( recognizable at the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) .
these parameters can be individually set for each file system . the current file system is selected using the Fil@@ esystem Fil@@ esystem with space limitation .
the groups that belong to the user can be found in the Pri@@ mary Group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field .
the Properties dialog contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , mark this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the user or group menu , or click the appropriate Add button on the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or the selected group works an@@ alog@@ ously .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot@@ manager , add , remove and change the boot password , change the time to boot the standard operating system , add the default operating system , remove , change operating systems , remove , change and more .
