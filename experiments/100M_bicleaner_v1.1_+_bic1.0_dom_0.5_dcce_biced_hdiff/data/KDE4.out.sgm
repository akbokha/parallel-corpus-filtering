<seg id="1">To translate the module website, please refer to the & konqueror; menu under Extras website. from the drop-down list, select the source and target language of the translation.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated into place of the whole & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation is only very rudimentary. in the best case, babelfish produces a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations should not make any important decisions without checking the translation before.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated by the Babelfish page itself, where you can insert texts to translate directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; contains various modules for & konqueror; despite its small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of & konqueror; by making it more readily available.</seg>
<seg id="6">Further information on the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual on & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror, select settings extensions... Open the card card tools and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of default configuration modules from the kde; addons. please note that you may need more modules on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, which contains & konqueror, before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click & konqueror; on Tools crashes. then you can view the page that has taken & konqueror; to crash, or delete the list of crashes, if present.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module Anconsiderate (also known as folder filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras Anconsiderate Filters. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed web page. as default starts the display with the root node of the document, for example: documentati, all other nodes are sub-elements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides another view for objects with the MIME-Type inode / directory in local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & FSView; consists of plotting nested hierarchies with the help of a so-called Tree-Map. tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose area is proportional to its size.</seg>
<seg id="15">With & FSView; the size reflects the size of a file or folder, whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can be easily detected even if they are far below the folder hierarchy. consequently, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you will be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; an entry in the Treemap presentation is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles feature meaningful colour and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched to color mode, can be either depth for easy recognition of the nesting depth or representation of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space for representation, or whether the area of subordinate rectangles is to be used (and therefore, display errors are caused by restrictions in the mark of the Treemap). in addition, you can set the relative position of the caption in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">For Treemap performance algorithms, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. in the Treemap in & FSView, this goal is not always respected. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How to partition the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. here, it is always advantageous for the labeling and avoidance of space losses through frames so that rectangles are created that are as square as possible. the best methods in this respect are lines, columns or recursive branches.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimum displayed area for an entry on the menu entry View on area. instead, a space pattern is drawn into the area of the higher-level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally it was & FSView; conceived as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap Widgets developed for the application KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">You can find the Picture Gallery in & konqueror; menu under Extras gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the Picture Gallery, a dialog opens with which you can set the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "the" "" "Title" "" "option allows you to edit the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field." ""</seg>

<seg id="34">With the input field comment file you can specify a comment file for the caption of images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box sele colour depth, you can set a different color depth for the thumbnail pictures than in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; Settings gives you easy access to the general & HTML; settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; Settings can be found in & konqueror; menu under Extras HTML settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">You can find the media playback for the navigation area in the & konqueror; menu under Windows Navigation Pane or with the F9 key shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click on the & konqueror navigation area; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Browser Detection adds a menu entry in & konqueror; add browser and operating system recognition for individual domains. this is useful for web pages that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The standard browser identifier of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a website that refuses to access this browser, change your browser identifier into one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Change the password in MSIE for pages that deny access to browsers on the basis of Mozilla. for example, you need the MSIE browser recognition to call with the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not correspond to the W3C standard or use your own & HTML; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identification of this outdated browser.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam; download more than 1000 digital cameras using the gphoto2 library. of course, each medium and every card reader who is supported by your operating system will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digicode; contains quick image editing with basic image editing tools. you can use them to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. the editing capabilities can easily be expanded with KDE Image plugin interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digikam, it is easy to use, dozens of professional capabilities are available. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support raw batch conversion with libraw, DNG export and ICC colour management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as eg; over the camera or lens that can be searched.</seg>
<seg id="59">As all & kde; programs is also & digicode; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of end users. therefore, you should report problems and improvement opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="60">Wherever you are in the program, the Help menu contains an entry problems or requests report.... This will open a dialog with an underlined link. if you use these links, your web browser will open a page in the error report system. all required information is already listed here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digikam; is a project that is supported by a community. that means that users and developers can help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we would like to ask you to help other users of & digikam. however, in this mailing list English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful in this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digicode; visit homepage to find news about shared versions and other information about & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to get to & digikam; to participate is registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for login to the developer mailing list of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you are digitized; for the first time, you'll be asked where you want to save your images and your database. simply enter a local, remote or remote folder. simply enter the path name or click the Folder icon Folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field, you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data file is saved. this path stays the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & digicode; will also use as an Albenbibliothek. digicode settings set up collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder containing the images as a base folder. & digicode; look at every subfolder as an album.</seg>
<seg id="68">& digicode; thirsts recursively the library path throughout its depth. you cannot exclude sub-folders unless there is iste in hidden folder. this can be done by barbs & digikam; do this by inserting a point in front of the folder name.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as root folders, you will notice that the albums in My AlbenList do not have photos as icons. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and discarding this on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can set up in & digipt; your digital camera. then you should learn how to use My Albums and My Keywords to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, so & digitis; possibly handle with it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported blank cameras in the Help Menu assistance menu.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in sections Roh decoder settings and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam; download more than 1000 digital cameras using the gphoto2 library. of course, each medium and every card reader who is supported by your operating system will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash, Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link). for actual transfer to the computer, the camera is often used as a USB mass storage device.</seg>
<seg id="75">Photo2 is a free, distributable software collection for digital cameras, which supports a steadily increasing number of more than 800 cameras. GPhoto2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for communication with the computer. since photos are generally large files and transmissions via the serial port are slow, this connection is now obsolete. & digicode; supports these cameras and results in the transmission of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">The exif support is needed by some libgphoto2 camera operators to read the thumbnails. if the exif support is not available in libgphoto2, you might not be able to see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things to do with digitisation is how easy it is to extend its functionality by adding modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is a joint module structure for & digikam;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and gwenview to develop. the goal is to provide the modules with all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as a user can. their advantage is that it is much simpler, and digitized; by writing a small module to add a function than the changes in & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the side bars with & LMB; or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drawing and dropping pictures works everywhere: you can put an image in another part of the tree, over the horizontal separation line or another application window. the only limitation is that a picture may not be stored in terms of keyword, date list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields currently displayed in the symbol view. in this way, the filter will only work on the filename when this is also displayed in the symbol view. which fields can be displayed in the dialog of the Albenign Settings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view of your photo albums. all photos, which were edited by & digikam, are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard disk, after the name of their collection in the albendings or after the date on which the album was first created. the date can be changed in the features of the album.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select album importing images. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there. in the then appearing menu, you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. you can also move or copy several photos in the same way. simply select all the photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album features, right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection from you is used to sort your photos after collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do so in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: is used when you sort your albums by date with View Album... sort by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The Eldest, Average, New Year's buttons: these set the date to the date of the oldest, the newest picture or the average of the album. first try to calculate the average of images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of last change of each file is used in this folder instead.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first opened an album in & digikam, the first picture in the album will be chosen as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this will help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as Album symbol, right click on the picture and click in the context menu & quot; As an album preview enquot;. in addition, you can drag the photo onto the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can always be included in a collection and collections can't be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digicode; supports input of key words for single photos in the area My Keyword list on the bottom of the main window. album collections always have a different effect. the collection always includes all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The picture window provides you with the main view of your photos. when you select an album, all images in this album are displayed in the picture window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of these thumbnails with the two magnifier buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album the first time, you must wait short while the thumbnails are generated. this can help you avoid using all thumbnails in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information on each image is displayed below the corresponding preview. what information this is, you can edit settings digicode; edit the albums page and adjust the thumbnail area to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails feature help buttons, which appear when you leave the mouse over a picture. the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo. the screenshot at the top of the introduction to the main window shows such a help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all about digitisation; go. albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures in a way that suits you. the image editing shows your photos and allows you to reach a number of improvements to them. you can choose all the features with & digikam. you can choose between viewing the images, a slide show or editing the images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image processing with a photo by using either F4 image editing... or selecting the contextual menu of the image with the right mouse button and selecting Edit.... in the editing pane, you will find instructions on how to edit your photos. with image editing, you can view and change your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">You can open a photo in another program by right-clicking the context menu and selecting the program from the open sub-menu. the applications listed there are checked by the & kde; file assignments for the file type. you will find information in the & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after processing other image editing programs, there may be problems with the metadata contained in the image. some programs do not save these data when you save the modified image. thus, this information is lost from the EXIF and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digicode; provides two options for rotation. the easiest option is to right click on the thumbnail to select and rotate. in the sub-menu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the filename of a photo, right-click on the preview and select F2 rename from the context menu. note that you retain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you delete a photo from & digikam, it is moved to the garbage dump of & kde; moved. F8 Image Delete or Del In case you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">The View & quot; My date list; organizes your photos based on the data. & digicode; use either the EXIF date or, if it is not available, the date of last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the date view to show you only the photos of the days selected.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keyword provides a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned individual photos or entire groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found through the selection of this keyword or a search again.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "tags can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. by this you can organize your keywords logically. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My" "" "Keyword list" "" "so that you can easily find the key words you are looking for." ""</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and allocated keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. so you can also use your keywords in other programs. besides, the keywords are re-imported from the loss of the database when & digikam; the pictures are noticed.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking on & quot; My keyword; or click on an existing keyword, then select New keyword. if you click a new keyword after clicking on an existing keyword, this keyword will be the subject of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by dragging it to the desired location in the tree and dropping it there. then a menu appears which gives you the possibility to postpone the keyword. a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by right-clicking it and selecting a keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the icon in the tree & quot; My template.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as Album symbol, select the picture with the right mouse button and set in the context menu as an album preview. in addition, you can drag the photo onto the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">This can be done in two ways: once you select the photos you have selected with a keyword, you can drag them to the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My keywords. alternatively, you can also right-click on the preview of the images and select cue from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can add a photo with any number of keywords. the photo is displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way, you can select a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was made, one for the event in which it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have selected a photo with keyword, this will be displayed under the preview of the image in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select from the Delete key menu. the menu only shows you the key words assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view shows a time-dependent adjusted histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved using this histogram. to select a time frame, you just have to click on the bottom rectangle of the selection frame, which indicates the time unit. this will display all associated images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below you can enter a title and save your selection, which will appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Include all database elements: names, reviews, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and more.</seg>
<seg id="125">When you click here, the filtering will be deleted and all images are displayed again. if the search hasn't found anything, then the lamp will be red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab on the left sidebar with the binoculars. if you open this you get a simple search box as described above. you can save this search here but as a live search, which always filter what you entered as a search criterion.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are satisfied with your selection, press the head OK and the search will be performed. the results will be used in the View My search list in the main window. if you want to change your selection after the search again, you only need to select the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">If you choose to edit search, the form to enter the search appears with the previously entered search information. if you choose to edit as advanced search, the dialog appears for the advanced search to change your previous search. here you will find more rules for searching. for more information, see the section The Tool for Advanced Search.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Create in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced search provides you with an extended search form with many search parameters, with which you can search in certain fields of & digicode; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the alb database. all rules are added row wise, separated by operators. one option can be added to this list with search group / search group. each option can be linked with others via the logical operations All..., One..., No... or At least...</seg>
<seg id="132">& digitisation; characterizes each image by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this makes it possible to compare images by comparing these signatures. the less the difference between two image signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar items: this is an area in which you can omit any image to find a similar. if you push a picture from somewhere over the icon of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar, it will open and you can let it fall there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free hand color sketch: draw a quick sketch and & editing; find the right pictures. here too, a threshold value can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map finder tool based on the Marble Miniprogram. you can move in or out with the mouse wheel or drag it. move it while you press the left mouse button. press Ctrl; left mouse button to pull a square. of course, all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your Geo filter. this will then be added for a later use of the list below. it works like a live geofolder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digicode; provides a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L to add the beacon from the context menu. the selection is added to the light table and its window opens.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview bar, you can drag and drop the images you want to see in the left or right area of the window. a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area you can see. if you select preview syncing from the toolbar and perform zoological and move operations on one of the images, then you will also be able to compare the same area of both images.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly sort out a picture series. if you are using pair-wise navigate from the toolbar, then both first images are automatically loaded into the areas to compare. now, use the left mouse button in any preview screen to display it in the left side.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, normal deletion actions also work directly from the light table, e.g. F4 file editing....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right sidebar of the main window is available for both thumbnails in the illuminated table. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">In the lower end of each section you will find a built-in swivel function that you can see on the crossed arrows. in order to swing the visible area of the picture, you must click it and hold down the & LMB; in the preview mode, both images will display the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zoom functions as well as in other views. just use the zoom knob under the images or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and out. this is done in both images if you are previewing in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">Digital inventory management considers each part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to the final issue and permanent storage. each of the photos received, scans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management. most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up, find, protect, protect, reorganize, group, secure, evaluate, group, archive, optimize, maintain and export image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital asset management picks up, indexes, categorizes, secures, searches, transforms, manufactures and export content that has a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is based on your definition data that provides information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I venture to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you do not need to find a certain photo without inventory management. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then you definitely do not use & digicode;. the approach to store the metadata in both a database and in the image files guarantees very fast searches and a secure archiving which you can access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate anything into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you must decide whether or not you want to save them to a reserved drive, or on a network drive, etc.</seg>
<seg id="151">You may be happy with this structure. vacation pictures can be quickly found about your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place. if you make enough photos, then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; then export is a folder for images you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, workflow, constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new files from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derivative picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend that metadata can be saved to the file's preferences page; enable it. this ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are written to the file. if you forget, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database to the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change which ones? edited by digicam; they provide a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts, as you should now choose any photo keywords, captions and a review. of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value then. this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos in the further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Now let's start with keywords, keywords, as you often call other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digicode; automatically insert the tree for you or insert the images in the right place. the sorting of the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by drawing a sub-tree to another.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata is overlapping itself. this is a very rough representation as each block of metadata is in truth composed of many sections. filenames and calendar dates are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most people don't want to see your photos only, they want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it closer, then you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you this is the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normans 60 years after landing. wow! you start dreaming of having associations, memories, the historical time span is present again, you may even hear the silence. so the caption has changed your perception of this panorama completely.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who view your photos, the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help him understand what you are moving about.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength to work only with a label for itself.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digikam, you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as caption. you can even export it for a selection of images. if you export your images in web galleries, then these labels will be exported to your wishes in the caption and / or title of the web gallery system.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find another city without a navigation system? was it not a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is now with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of using geolocation are innumerable and will become even deeper in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your journeys using images with geographic indications. & digikam; can also export kml files that you can open with Google Earth.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and describes the practice to use copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information in the furnishing page of & digikam; should be stored as information:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to protect the photographer's name, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization may not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title: linked to the author. this field contains the job title of the photographer. examples of this can be titles like: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer.</seg>
<seg id="174">Editor (synonym for providers): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer works for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here, which you offer the picture to others.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they do not offer protection against misuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calculator can delete or modify this, in the picture. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per picture. & digikam; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: record failure, disk failure, current violations, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, recovery, redundancy, desaster prevention, life time, temperature, data size, spread Aberrant</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire. these types of losses are the same that can happen to you even on traditional paper photos or negatives.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">In order to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs, they need to be treated cautiously and you can't buy you longer than a couple of years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality that last longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers over gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much more reliable. so it is about choosing the right one.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors even if you have just written. that's why they use a checksum mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data is only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control summers. despite this massive protection they age through chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For faulty CDs and DVDs there is a convenient program called IsoBuster which apparently works wonders for CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux, but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks, hard disks, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to capture the format war against HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB.</seg>
<seg id="185">Do not burn the media with a description, date & author identifier and then store in a clean, dark dry and in front of animals protected site. don't forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disklabel keeps your statistics for themselves. their manufacturer's guarantees include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard drives on this subject: floppy study</seg>
<seg id="187">Electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of failure, SMART cannot detect these errors. some of the errors identified by SMART preclude the imminent drop. this is especially read errors and shift counter. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files, but these losses can normally be restored without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices do not matter much, this can cause serious damage on devices with computer chips and high speed processors. these anomalies can cause serious damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause closed keyboards, complete data loss, hardware alteration, destroyed motherboards and other defects. so protect yourself from the inevitable result in a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against current peaks is overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs part of the energy heat and grounded the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug-in bar. remember, however, that not every connector also includes overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, you should make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should ensure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are also protected. some manufacturers produce overvoltage shakes which also include a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coax cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a laptop, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are especially designed for notebooks and are therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you with a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it may therefore make sense to invest in an uninterruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltage, these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs. some models allow you to store your data and run down the system. if you buy a UPS then you should be sure that it meets the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with the cost of avoiding it. a high-quality overvoltage protection can cost you up to & euro; 20 cost, A 500W UPS can be used for less than & euro; 40.</seg>
<seg id="197">Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can use it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software.</seg>
<seg id="198">However, compared to the hard drives at home you are very expensive - 40 GB costs & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send the data about the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are linked to photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, the web solutions are very safe. data transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and with the big companies included in the offer is a backup and a distributed memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer. all transfers are prone to transmission errors.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that nobody tells you when this occurred in your hardware. all these interruptions remain undetected until one day you open a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise. it is quite disturbing that there should be no protection in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not currently affected by transfer problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates that can handle plate errors on a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard under the GPL incompatible license.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched its own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. it is still in alpha state. it uses the same protective mechanisms that ZFS uses and is also available for & Linux; but it's not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">These two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in the notebook and 46% of the workstation systems. in notebooks, the share of thefts amounts to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to reduced damage, such as theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; for a long time nobody has been sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss than proprietary systems: untrue, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the most popular file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden break during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings removed from fundamental physical boundaries. it is meant that while technology continues to develop there is a natural limit for this advancement. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all kinds of light sensors are no longer far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is rather deteriorating. a sensor size of 6 megapixels and a high quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so do not blame anybody else for data loss. so, save your data according to a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous like the reinstallation of your operating system, the exchange of disks or the resizing of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backups every day on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, lightning strikes you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget airplane crashes: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually concern an entire room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore desaster prevention is always a non-local storage. bring your backups up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above, a common reason for data loss despite securing the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential lock: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot of two points of time: one of the complete backup and the last differential lock.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. generates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup was made.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference between the files that have actually been changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Back up important images directly after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">At the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. any further dilution should happen manually, after which you have made a complete check.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, IPTC stored in the image file, keeping associated XMP files, original, memory, scalability, media, reviewing images and metadata, copying images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing devices,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years, that is approximately the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you have to consider everything that is said today with caution and re-evaluate as time passes. unfortunately, you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered based on the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important for reading your images, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the technical expression for the ability to change a system in its size. this is actually increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planned the scalability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. with * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and relocate it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the dmesg command if your new disk has been detected by the system, but do not append it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollars; dd if = / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the disk in MBgt; # works with ext2.3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of reiserfs if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no more software to read, then you can create it yourself. this task will be easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">It is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16 bits per colour channel and full transparency. the disadvantage is that it requires relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF and has a slow compression.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF is widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or container with lossless compression algorithm (Define). it manages images in high quality but requires very large files. with some cameras, you can store your images in this format. however, there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG Digital Negative file format is a royalty-free and open-format image format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed on the basis of the need to standardize camera ressources. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and commits to the use of metadata.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, to replace Adobe's XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Image resource block quot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a coding technology that allows users to embed their data into a file itself. the file information is saved with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; saved for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive the original image, mostly in raw format. XMP fits as it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when linking the metadata file and the image file, and as noted above, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization that supports fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of deployment and business models. DCMI's activities include work on architecture and modelling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI workgroups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve far-reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images are on the cameraman, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and store them in your raw archive. this feature is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a subtle editing, you can use external programs. if you edit the images again & edit, then you should add the metadata again.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the copyrighted images for copyright with a digital watermark. export them to web galleries, encode in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digikam; you can add a description of how to add photos you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your database.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digicode; to use, connect it to the computer, turn the camera on the display mode and switch it. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">If you start the camera interface, it will try to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a finished Indicator will appear at the bottom end and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before downloading the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the side bars properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The tab metadata shows the internal metadata such as the exif, manufacturer notice, GPS, etc of the image. this information is the same as with the metadata sidebar from the main window of & digikam; or the image processing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the button download and then download the selection of all. this loads all photos from their camera into a single album in & digikam. at downloading, the photos are not deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all the photos, you can select only the desired with the default selection methods of & kde; select the download button and then download Selected. download the button Selected until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New Download is available. in this case, the new images are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, only the new images will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you are using the All or selected buttons you can select a dialog with which you can select the target album in which the photos are discarded. you can read the list of existing albums, such as normal folders. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After selecting the target album, press OK, and & digiclip; load the photos from the camera into the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete them all at once, by deleting the Delete button. if you want to delete only some, you must first select them and delete the chosen deleted.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no possibility to restore images you have deleted from the camera. so you should carefully check if the photos were successfully downloaded in a & digicode; so you should carefully check if the photos were successfully removed from the camera. if you want to completely delete the camera, you should do so via the camera, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras often don't use a very meaningful name for the photos. the file names are normally recycled once the photos are deleted from the camera. this can lead to duplicate file names if you load photos of different recording sets into the same album. therefore, it can be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image was taken into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for date-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, a folder is automatically created per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The first two relate the data via the author in the standard car identity section. if you select this, the corresponding entries are copied from the Exif information into the IPTC fields. with the latest option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you want a different date format than the default format, you can, for example, use the prefix photo-% Y-% m-% d% H:% M:% S. turn on the option date & time. for further adjustments, you should read the help of the strftime command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the optional camera file name, you can change the file names in lowercase letters when downloading. or in capital letters if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & digicode; used for a photo, is shown below the name which the camera provides in the preview. your settings for renaming will be saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digitisers; can use all the information on the camera's orientation at the time point of the recording to make automatic lathe during the download. not all cameras provide this information. in the section sidebar metadata, you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic turn is usually switched on, and when your camera does not deliver this information, the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic rotation, use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">When your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was made, it can & digicode; use this to automatically load sub-albums in the target album. all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub-album. not all cameras provide this information.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually turned off, and digitized in this case; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you must turn on this option. use the Advanced button and select the date-based sub-albums at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to their camera is the button download. then select Upload. the File selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded. you can also choose more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, ask & digicode; you where the images should be uploaded. a folder drop-down dialog for the camera appears. select the folder you want and press OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this refers to a position indicated in longitude and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. the data can be ascertained by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this capability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten where exactly the photo was done, you can open a browser with a click that shows the area. if you want to send a postcard to another, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, semitrailer and map references.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few who work with GPS receivers. either as a card module or through transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you need to store these data in gpx format, as this is the only format supported by the geo-mapping module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract and correlate the data from images and from the GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; do: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script that works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the precharacters, which are created by maps.google, for example.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show any European street maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish that show all the navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digicode; tries to give you so much control over his work procedures as possible. there are many settings that change the behavior of & digikam. in order to access these settings, you need to select Settings dialog; you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be displayed on embedded preview or start image editing. so you set the default behavior of & edited; specify when you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written into the corresponding IPTC data fields, if the option was selected from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for author field: this field should include the job title of the photographer. this can be designations such as a photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the author field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Editor is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify the picture that offers the photo. this does not have to be the author if this is for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be registered here as this is the picture of others & quot;. if the picture is a stock photo, then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the appropriate IPTC-fields. this means that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of & digikam; these metadata are also available to other programs and can be imported in & digicode without going missing.</seg>
<seg id="289">Image descriptions as embedded captions (JFIF) save in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the labels embedded in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse pointer is in the main window over a file. depending on the selected option, this information will be displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digikam; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digicode; trying to display, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list.</seg>
<seg id="292">You can reset the default settings again by pressing the Update button to the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the light switch from & digikam; can be set to the default values on this page. however, each time you open the light table these settings will not be available. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can turn off the toolbar when you use image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or bright color in the picture. these colors are set here. in the image processing, this view mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With chroma-subsampling it is meant that the images are coded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG compression setting you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality as PNG uses a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">This reduces the size of the TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it has no effect on image quality since the delate algorithm works loss-free.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the loss-free JPEG 2000 files you can save lossless. even if you choose the lossless setting, the ratio between quality loss and file size is much better than in normal JPEG. when this paragraph has been written, metadata has not yet been supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In earlier versions of & digikam, image editing was only an image viewer for photos. currently, it is very fast becoming a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard capture is that all green pixels are equal. if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitively to ultraviolet light than the pixels in odd lines, this difference creates a lattice pattern in the output.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard is a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images get more details in the top lights in four steps. for other cameras, this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default is the pointed beam, so the parts of your images that have burned down due to the inability of your camera to catch the top lights than to look through white in the settings. the setting colors trigger some failed results, as they display the pointed-lights in various pink tones. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels are generally not as quickly saturated as green and red. & digikam; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red parts from the unsaturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the reconstruct option, you get the possibility to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value to your taste. you probably need to set it slightly higher than the standard 1. however, this can also be done later in the editing options of the & digicode; in order to keep the time for the demo icing small, you should go conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the sub-raw data captured by the color-filtered image sensor that has many cameras and which provides a matrix of colored pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">After some tests it looks like AHD Interpolation (for Adaptive Homogenic-Directed) created the quality for me and the paper used by me. VNG Interpolation (variable number of gradient) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses, you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a color avoidance correction, as you are carried out during the conversion process.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to be given them again. there is also LCMS and & digikam; information such as color information from a color space in the other is to translate so that the colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior questions when a picture is opened in image processing / color management module with raw files start.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile folders set the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can save all your profiles.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of the ICC-Profiles You have the option & quot; default source; for your profiles to deposit. everything can be changed when opening the raw file.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here only your images do not color the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">Not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, like Canon, which do not include color mapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw Gamma does not correct for conversion at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to do the mapping yourself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the Soft-Proof profile you can emulate as your picture would be given back from one device. this is very useful before you print image, since your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors may therefore have a very saturated effect.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious what color profile is provided for. unfortunately not with Canon's models. therefore, here follows a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. of course, this answer is not official:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension provides the style for the target: F for an accurate style, L for Landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for the Standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image plugin interface. it is an interface supported by a range of & kde; image viewer and image processing. by deploying this interface, & digicode can support; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, see a list of the available modules. select the modules you want to use, and these are then edited by & digikam. these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition, you will also find some in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the Settings menu under Settings.</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information (in English) via KIPI modules, you can get via the KIPI project at http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper control adjusts the time between the image transitions, usually 4-5 seconds well. the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off, which are displayed at the bottom end of the pictures during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features show on the left side a list of all supported cameras. on the right hand side there is a button Automatic detection, which tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure the camera is properly connected, switched on and in the picture-line mode. currently, there are serial, USB and USB / FireWire mass storage devices.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end you can set the path for USB and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you choose a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use digicam, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it to the display mode and switch on.</seg>
<seg id="329">If you do not, you can manually set the camera model and port manually. once you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. it is displayed in the main window's Cameras. if you have more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; images in the trash bin, you can adjust the & digicode dialog; when deleting a photo in an album, you can find more details when deleting a photo and deleting an album.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right sidebar can be tacitly used & edited; if you use the option to apply changes in the right sidebar without any feedback. otherwise, you must save the changes using the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also display the welcome screen from & digikam; in case of starting, it may speed up & digicode start-up.</seg>
<seg id="334">When something is deleted from the base folder, it asks & digikam; if something is to be deleted from the base folder, you will be asked if it is to delete them from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Various color schemes can be edited in & digikam; be used to customize the main window to your taste. you can select these settings from the toolbar in Settings Design. a preview of the available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in plain text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digikam, you will find more information about it in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digicode; contains quick image editing with some basic tools. you can use them to view and improve your photos and to correct and improve. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry / edit entry.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image editing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digi.You may not be part of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window showing the file name, current file number, magnifying factor, and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar on the top edge and among them the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the image processing change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before you have used File Save or the Save button from the toolbar. note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it. this can be done with File Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by restoring from the File Recover or the button Restore the image processing Restore in the toolbar. you will then lose any change you have done in the photo since the last save.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually any image processing action can be undone or restored. the last action you can undo by clicking Edit Restore or Restore by selecting Edit Restore from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently, you should use the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z to undo and note Ctrl; -switch-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; press a moment longer via the undo or restore button in the toolbar, you will get a context menu. if you select one of the menu items, all actions in between will also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, image down, or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter in the photo and zoom out in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select Enlarge factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode. you will see the normal view in which you are using the Esc key. if you do not want to do so, you can change it in the Settings dialog of & digikam. you can view it from the & digicode; main window. see the section for setting up image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can select the image in the File menu and get the default & kde; Print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before printing your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single images or whole sets. whole picture pages can be selected from your selection. you only have to select the images with the standard methods and select the print wizard from the Album Export menu. if you follow the wizard, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">Das & digikam; main window has a sidebar at the right edge, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available without the navigation file, also in image editing. it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple Click on the same tab let the sidebar appear or disappear into the margin.</seg>
<seg id="355">The text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the captions are copied to EXIF and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only supports ASCII characters and is limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are changed. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should consider these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented it, use either the Apply button or just switch to the next image, the captions are then saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">With this, you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this is always done when you choose a metadata setting that is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and grading. it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard shortcut Strg + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images simultaneously, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC-field of Regency. the code is followed by the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword list shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword-tree and a selection box with the keywords used before in this & digitisation session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the given keyword. you can quickly limit the number of possibilities in search for a keyword. this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is a further relief when entering keywords for a picture series. if you have typed different keywords, they are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding tick boxes in the tree. all keywords of an image are keyword in the IPTC-field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the Keyword tree, this will only apply to the highlighted image and not the entire selection, if you want to add a keyword, please read the Keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The KeywordFilter side bar is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window. normally, the left sidebar with their album is used - date, keyword and search views. if one or more keyword filters are used from the right-hand side, only the intersection of these two will be displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop tags. suppose you have selected multiple images in the main view to provide you with keywords. if the keyword exists, you can simply drag it from the right sidebar and place it on the selection.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the images on a calendar day. the keyword filter is listed in no keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. they were selected using Ctrl + a, and then a keyword was drawn from the right keyword-tree to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks whether this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be disabled under Settings Items.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have created and created a rule and find that it needs to be one or more, you can easily change this by double-clicking on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry in which the database is searched for. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator which is a name or a string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">You can, for example, set an Advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then select the grouping button. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb and Flickr not listed? free storage space is limited to 1 GB and you won't want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I am mainly editing & editing; s concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is the colors that come from your camera or scanner a predictable deviation from the actual photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can reach that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that match the colors you print or publish in the web to those from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the theme comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at any point in the image processing workflows. in addition, you should provide you with adequate background information via color management. in addition, you should enable you to make your own informed decisions so that you can get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other images are via email or the web where sRGB is de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB is working so well and makes life so easy, why should you use another color space and worry about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2 dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the horseshoe region, and the colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to install my monitor if I chose to work only in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you work in sRGB colour space or not, you need to allocate your monitor, since sRGB means that your; onitor to sRGB is allied. if you are working as a sRGB colour gamer then you need either to allocate your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, please use it before attempting any further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, compensate, automatic offset and contrast expand from the Conducting Automatic Correction menu attempt automatically to make the most of your colors. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the Leuststrengthened values across the whole picture so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magic correction for pictures that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">Comparing: this method adjusts the luminous factor of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible. sometimes the same number of pixels results in the improvement of the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation which causes either miracle in an image or it destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic comparison: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and luminous intensity of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the widest range and a new level of all values in between. this is only visible in selected pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance from & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is slightly restricted because of a color space with 8-bit per colour. if you are too far from the original picture, areas with overexposure may occur. if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you can start it using the menu entry Color white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left hand side both the original image as well as the preview of the target image can be seen. the preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance, then click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target image has a red marker. the luminance of pixels under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">The histogram is very helpful, even in well-lit pictures, most pixels are very small luminance values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. shadow adjustment lets you improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the color temperature of the white balance to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. this way, the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the default settings list. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will see the combined result in the white balance. this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save As and Load buttons do exactly this. any setting of the white balance you have set can be saved to a text file and then reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button resets all filter values back to its default values and the associated neutral white balance. note that neutral settings will also result in a different picture than your original. if you save it, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image. 8-bit coding is the common JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high-quality images. however, this coding requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as for editing raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be done by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed manual for using color profiles allows you to consult the ink management chapter.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is to find tonal color correction in the menu. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously, so you can always use it for several photos. this is useful if your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and therefore always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find in colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">Das & digikam; tool color effects will provide you with four color effects, a solar effect effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In the age of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was an effect of creating a partially developed pressure with a short flash light and afterwards completed the development of the image. this had the effect that the lighter areas were darker and the colors were inverted by the second lighting. the result was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to fine-adjust this interesting effect.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar process. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar energy effect. the original image is the (1) and it processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot effect. it differs from saturation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. just try it, it beautifuls many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted colour film produced by Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth picture structure. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neonlight on the contrast edges. the Level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neon light. in large pictures, the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual for you to correct the color contrast and the luminous intensity of the photos. you can experiment the different color areas of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjustment can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result, use the button OK and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">When you make a photo with poor light conditions you can get the opposite problem: one too big saturation. also in this case the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. all changes you can perform can be previewed. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool Gradation and the simple Leuchthickness / contrast / gamma, the tool is set to improve exposure. even if the dialogue with this tool works very complicated, you need only the range of slides for the purpose described here. more specifically, the three slide gates below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, active channel or the selected area. under the graph, three slide gates are clicked into and can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to use it is to move the slider to make sure that the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand side, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview will be dynamic, based on the settings of the image, updated. on the left-hand side, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: this selection box shows whether the histogram is displayed using a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controllers: the top one for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gamma-values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three colour tweets can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows, medium and bright tones. furthermore, there is a button for fully automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output: the output values allow selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controls which can be used to change the output rate interactively as in the input values. for example, the compression of the output values can be used to create an extended picture as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save and load: using these buttons, the set values can be stored in the filesystem and then reloaded. to do this, the Gimp Levels format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipette, the input is automatically adjusted for all shadows, means and sun shades. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The overexposure indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of the adjustment of the input applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photograph. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">The left-hand side displays half of the original and the target image. the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings. the following options are available on the right-hand side:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified duct: this selection box allows the channel to be specified, which is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box there are two symbols to change between a linear and logarithmic view. for images taken with a digital camera, linear mode is mostly the most meaningful. for images with large areas of a constant color, linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode will help.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you shift a short section to the right, e.g. the bright tones, you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and that the corresponding pixels become darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photo you can see a red marker. if you want to shift this selection to the area you want to change, a matching line will appear on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save and load: with these buttons you can do exactly that. any curve you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you use this method and the three color pipette buttons automatically create the curve control points for all channels of shadow, middle and sun tone. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The overexposure indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel exposed pixels are found, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the Luminance Channel. shadow and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The digital channel mixer is a tool for improving the color channels or changing the color hues of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the color tones of the images. you can edit it from the color channel mixer of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">Using the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and output. the left part of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed in comparison to your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the picture, a vertical line in the histogram will display the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are right down: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you activate luminance, the image will retain the overall brightness as well, since the channel mixer then is THE tool for creating great black-and-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise that comes from the colour space. colourless consists of small diamond-artefacts that don't appear in the same place in the color channel and whose spatial pattern looks different in each channel. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion in which you can reduce the colour space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any mixer setting can be saved for later and then load. the file format used is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The overexposure indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the Luminance option is activated. the original image can be seen under (1) and the edited image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a step in which colour images can be easily converted on the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford Panther Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green Fill: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lentil filter. this looks great, with all scenery pictures and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange Filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotfilter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lentil filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate moonlight scenes at the time of day. thus, similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) Rotary.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural colour tone correction and improves contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces warm light and medium tones while adding a bit of cold in the saddle tones. this is very similar to the process of bleaching a pressure and redevelopment in a sepion oner. this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) sepian.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digicode; apply tool texture you can apply decorative textures to an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, stitch an old master, a pop art portrait from enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and three-dimensionality of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper of text effect has been applied on the photo below. the original picture is (1) and the changed under (2). the relief parameter has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digicode; tool frame can be added a decorative frame to be added a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. one way to retain his attention is to set the picture a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, you set the desired frame type for your image. completely surrounded the picture with a colored line, nicece surround it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), bent it with a nice three-dimensional frame that is ideal for a knocker effect and decorative adding an ornamental frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: indicates the width of the frame in percent. the value range for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing images, especially if you have previously used the tool after aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can insert easily a formatted text into a picture in any place. this also goes in several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. just enter the text and place it with the mouse. the larger the image, the bigger the character set must be. at the end, simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press "OK." once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digicode; tool Template apply you can put a template on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image template can be used in image processing can be used to place templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to reduce the file size of the template. if you want to add your template of the template, just send an email in English to the & digikam. mailinglist digikam-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your template folder with the button root folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you have copied the template files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder for the template has been set appears a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the template folder. selecting a folder automatically updates the preview toolbar of the templates.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magnifying factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrinking: this button resizes the underlying picture. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you must decrease the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the picture lying under the template. to do so, take the picture and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK when you want to apply the template to your image. the image is then automatically adapted to the thumbnail size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digicode; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool to sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but produces, especially in dark areas, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blur mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper. actually it does not sharpen any bit, it works rather psychovisually. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunst and it makes here a really good job. the algorithm was taken out of Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is probably the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjusting.</seg>
<seg id="483">Images without a focus and most digitalised images require a correction of sharpness. this is because the digitization process needs to be condensed with minimal differences. this in turn results in blurred edges a little blur. SLR cameras usually require more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for home users.</seg>
<seg id="484">Images in the raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a field of sharpening already during the reading of the image. if you disable it, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can obtain useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening value. this can be called with the menu entry Conducting Field.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should deal with this carefully as the results do not work very natural: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also reinforces the noise. in general, the most suitable technique for sharpening an image will refocus the tool. you can refocus it through the menu entry. under refocusing, you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than it is to sharpen. use the tool to soften the soft mark with the menu entry Conducting softeners and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tried out first. an increase of the radius or the amount amplifies the effect. if you make the blurred mask too strong, noise and the impression of burr will create close to sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, you should best sharpest images in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image, which is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applied difference amount. thus, a minimal difference can be defined thus for an edge of the filter. thus, areas with a soft alternation between the tones are excluded from sharpness and therefore beauty mistakes in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the fuzzy escaping filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2). blurring is used with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">Das & digikam; tool refocused refocused a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright-protected design-filter algorithm of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to sharpen an image to & quot; refocused quot; in which it reverses the focus. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. the traditional technique for sharpening images is using a blur mask. refocusing typically achieves better results than blurred.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauß's fold. the Gauss's fold has a very long tail, which causes the mathematical result also from the source pixel, which is far from the original source pixel. in most cases, the FIR Wiener Inverse of the Gauß's fold is strongly influenced by the distant pixels. this causes undesired results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should result in 1 good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation may help to reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and the values close 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, eg; 0 the image quality is very poor.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the palate's sharpness. use this parameter if your blur is wrong. in most cases, you should omit this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a value unlike zero, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you choose large values for the circular sharpness or the palate. note, however, that the module is very slow if you choose large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameter you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all the trimmings, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that a lot of operations are not immediately visible, but leave behind unpleasant artefacts later.</seg>
<seg id="507">When you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the unsharp masking of a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blurring. for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal linear filter. practically the result of the FIR Wiener filter is always at least as good as the blurring mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between different filters, on a small unfocused image, see:</seg>
<seg id="511">This picture has been made with an analogous camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of sharpening in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English below this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The slider smoothens the blur of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The colour ink allows a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, you can adjust it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings fine you can use the smoothing and Advanced Settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail maintenance p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of the details. a small value leads to smoother smoothing over the picture. whereas larger values mainly smooth homogeneous regions and make details sharp.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes in all directions, while a value close to 1 is smoothed in one direction. if you have a film-graining or CCD slip will create a high value wave-like pattern. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value close to 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, because it is difficult to set the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: specifies how often the algorithm is passed through. normally, one or two is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle-amplitudes [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if alpha is small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles produce a long runtime. thus, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral stride length [0,1, 10]: integral stride width in pixels. you should set the value less than 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never exceed 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Use linear interpolation: the more quality you receive by selecting this option is only minor, but it doubles the runtime. we recommend it to skip it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The saving and loading buttons are exactly this. correct any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and then reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take very long time and load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors with small artefacts removed. the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is a strange black artifact in the foreground that caused by a poor film shift during the journey. the original picture is under (1) to see and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The digitisation; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to decrease image noise. it uses a copyright-protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts, e.g. from dust or hairs on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the sub-window details and the sub-window Advanced Settings can stay with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) which is used for the filter. large values increase the time required by the filter per pixel and can blur the image. the area indicated by the radius is smoothed over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller bugs fixed.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel pitch from the filter forward to determine luminance changes. if the value is too high, you may need to re-adjust the edges filter if you change this setting. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter can no longer be maintained and noise or lubricating occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong it cannot be removed all the noise or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG-artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we advise you to change colour or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend altering color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamemolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas, which are typically used more strongly. however, it also merges the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of the phase damping. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of luminance. if it is increased, the edges appear smoother if it can be too high. if it is on its minimum, noise and phase jitter can occur on the edges.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used exactly for that. all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be saved to the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction has been applied to the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too snappy for your purpose. fortunately, the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use tool to soften with the menu entry Conducting softeners and experiment with smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digikam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film grain, scratches, compression artifacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or subsequently digitalized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">Reduce JPEG artefacts: JPEG compression is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a lossless compression algorithm, it generates some compression & quot; artefacts; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The saving and loading buttons are exactly this. each setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and then recharged.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take very long time and load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="551">The module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera to an Ilford (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film on the faces. the original image is below (1) and the corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example for photo restoration. this time, textures were reduced to an old color photo that was read with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts that were caused by scanners and photo paper. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The digitisation; tool Hotpixel allows hotpixel of photos that were shot with a CCD camera gem, eight have to be removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPIxi project, which are protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high-quality raw mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in repression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; and "quot; bright Pixelquot; and" quot; bright Pixelquot; on a photo with a dark-picture subtraction method. there is currently no manual way to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Load this file into the wizard with the button darken. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these will be highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark image directly in the connection to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the right dark image to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview will help you correct the results within the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are lifted out in all preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and see the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square turns (1-dim) that is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The digitisation; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide-angle lenses, especially the medium and large photo format, cannot illuminate the entire sensor area evenly. instead, & quot; vignettierentquot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it also has cons. many center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which makes it impossible to hold the camera manually. wide-angle lenses should, also with center filters, use an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise unsharpening effects arise through movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure ranges of today's filmenand the color or greyscale depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a CenterFilter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image that was made without this filter. the tool Vignetting Correction turns the transformation with a CenterFilter on a picture. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators, you can control the Vignetting Correction filter and with three further the exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity damping at the point of the highest density filter. the standard density is 2.0, meaning an optical filter with aperture setting of 1, or by chance of a light intensity of 2,. increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it by a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Light intensity, contrast and gamma setting: editing an image with the Vignetting Correction reduces the luminance of pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide positive values as you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer readjustment of the target image, let the values for luminance / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digicode; image processing from the color gradation menu.</seg>
<seg id="574">The original image (1) shows the Vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a Leuchamp and contrast correction was also performed in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The digitisation; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colourless distortion can't be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree covers the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third grain has a similar round effect, but flattens at the edges. this correction is not applied in the mold.</seg>
<seg id="579">If you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">In general: this value controls the strength of distortion 2nd degree. with negative values, barrel distortion can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of the distortion part. this value appears more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'Corner parameter has the inverted accidentals of the Parameters General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this scale resizes the image size and results in correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brighten up: this value adjusts brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase them.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog with a Preview shows the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The correction should be performed prior to any cutting or size changes. it is best to perform this correction first of all. if you want to re-cut an image and then perform a tonne correction, the effect would be apparent to the wrong one.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best corrections, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal support line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to show the dotted lines. move it to an important location, such as the sea edge or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can correct the tonne / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them with the cutting tool in the transformation process, or via the Zoom knob of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some subjects such as shots from front, frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that when you hold the camera with the hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonne correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infra-red film of the GimpGuru.org web site that is reachable under this URL. the filter produces the known ILford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrarotfilm, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview, you can set two parameters to adjust film and film sensitivity (ISO). turn on the Include Film Capture option if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO control changes the amount of film grain and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature). green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Because the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared films, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos because the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the trotter.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digicode filter is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film images on your pictures. this is known from classical high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturers mix large silver grains of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film-grading effect gives your photo a certain mood or appears to shift back into the past. the treated picture gets rid of a timeless ambiance from everyday life. if you want to use this special, gallery-like, road-photographic, grainy appearance especially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">The controller can calibrate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, set to ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film-grained effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digicode; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright-protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">Digitisation; Filter oil paintings give your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. natural images and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls to influence this effect. the top selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images. smoothing controls the smooths or, viewed from the other side, the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the processor is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smoothed 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The digitisation; Filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gradient to create a carbonic sketch. the lines that outline the outlines in the drawing are emphasized. images whose gradients will slowly change are therefore not ideal for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper controller selects the pen size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the coal drawing filter. the original picture (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digicode; Filter engraver shapes your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digicode; Filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure, where color is not the most important element. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey, monochrome landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">Depth allows adjusting the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, equivalent to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the finished image (2). the depth used is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group, you can transform a normal photograph into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divide the image into cells and lets it look as if it is viewed through glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analog to the wave blocks 1, the image is distorted with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group, you can transform a normal photograph into a work of art using blur effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharpness: blurs the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from one center. this simulates the blur a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blur: blurred the image by turning the pixels around a center point. this simulates the blur of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Sharpness: blurred the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to be back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion blur: wipes the image by horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blur of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train taking photos, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Soft drawing: blurs the image softly in the dark and strongly in the light tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and gleaming soft focus effect (Hamilton Effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Shaking: blurs the image by shifting the pixels by random shifting and thus simulates the blur of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Smart blurring: finds the basins in the picture and blurs them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: splits the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it, by filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel this calculation at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops into your picture. this makes it natural to your pictures a wet appearance. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn's copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Drop size allows to change the size of drops. as the droplet size does not automatically increase with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes changes the optical effect of the drops on the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can keep an area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you start the filter regentropfen, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the regentropfen filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the illustrated picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it through mirroring or turning in the correct orientation. you can find the tools in the transformation Turning or Transforming.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo blowing is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is, how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into an image when the boundaries of resolution are reached? how can you reinvent or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm that is used here makes a good job. try it and you'll see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select to change size in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog can be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for size change uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality then try the tool to inflate.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation for enlarging an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS labs in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the New size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain aspect ratio: when this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, because it is difficult to set the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save As and Charging buttons are used precisely for this purpose. each stallurement for photo magnification can be saved as a text file and then recharged.</seg>
<seg id="638">The photo is very fast with what it does, but it can still last very long and take a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo bubbles by enlarging a small image on the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard magnification.</seg>
<seg id="640">Cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to create a picture. to cut a photo you just have to create with the mouse just the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and raising the rectangle. you will see this rectangle then while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button, the area of the photo will be cut away. you can change the size of the area to be cut by dragging at the corners of the rectangle. create a new rectangle by simply clicking with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button The cutting knob of image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut to size (Ctrl; + X).</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by dragging the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="644">Depending on the aspect ratio, you can specify orientation as a portrait or a landscape format. in portrait format, the higher value of the height and the cross-format width is always assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">Trimming After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches, inches or any other physical size. you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">At the bottom of the dialog, you can set the area for cutting to the greatest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">When you use the trimming tool next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that EXIF data reflect the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the integration help enable you to hide help so that you can better assemble your images. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangle: harmonic divisions are based on the principle of similarity. as the third-third rule, harmonious triangles are a way to divide a rectangle into similarly harmonious triangles at the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden centre is a division that affects various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden pitch at all times when you put together your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden center. a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides more fluid relief lines when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos. in comparison to the third rule, the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this kind of composition leads the viewer's gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">One more rule is the rectangles of the golden spirals, also called golden rectangles. this rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. it should be something that the eye falls into the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangles are also derived from the golden spiral above. their vertices are the center points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not equal triangles. diagonals to place these lines can have a static object more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your image focus at one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can't achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizontal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic dividings.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button Color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines can become invisible. in this way, you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">When you make a photo, it happens easily that you do not hold the camera vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle. you can do this with the & digicode; image processing and tool free rotation.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your picture with slide angle. the values on this slide are specified in degrees. with the Preferences button, you can set the slider back to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image will be shown at the top right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the picture, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix this is to use the function Transforming trimming from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the picture is the automatic cutting. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The Anti-Aliasing option smoothes the picture a bit after rotation. note however the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed by a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview is then automatically calculated. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty spaces created by the transformation in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty spaces created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Corner left above: shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Corner right above: shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: shows the current angle in degrees in the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right below: shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image is smeared a little. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments create a doubly strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transformers trimming from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">This is not a rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle turns into a parallelogram. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module via transformers.</seg>
<seg id="679">You can shoot horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you press preview, the angles will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed to the right of the preview area.</seg>
<seg id="680">For your help, a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed. move the mouse to an important point, like the lake, a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you've done the scaling, the picture gets blurred. for a single scaling, this effect is usually negligible, but two chings produce twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the scaling, the picture has triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transformers trimming from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digicode; needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write picture formats. the available formats therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependency from other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system at this point. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digikam; displays only files in formats that are familiar with. this is done using the file extension and a comparison of those with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list, the file will be digitized; you can change this list of file extensions.</seg>
<seg id="686">Nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digikam; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the use of data compression processes on digital images. in doing so, redundant information is reduced in order to save the image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. generally, there are better, smoother results than JPEG in the same compression ratio.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the tube format, you can read in English on Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful guides in English. you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TIFF by & digikam. in the configuration section, you can find further information about using modules with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="690">& digikam; supports the loading of raw images only with the program dcraw, which is included in & digikam. this supports more than 200 raw file formats. all support cameras can be seen at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coffin. the table below shows a short list of raw formats that are supported by & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="691">Many digital cameras support recording short films. these clips are often recorded in AVI- or MPEG format. & digikam; but is not a film editing program and therefore has no built-in options to view or edit movies. when you click on a movie file & digicode; the & kde; settings for playing movies use to start the program for playback.</seg>

<seg id="700">Many tools you need to do photo editing are in & digicode; included. your description will follow here.</seg>
<seg id="701">All image editing tools like sharpening, softness, noise reduction, refocused, non-sharp mask, & etc;. use a common dialog box indicating the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current picture. below you will see & quot; texture authenticated; in this dialog:</seg>

<seg id="725">& kgraphiviz; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; Graphs; graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. so far there has not been a modern & GUI; program to visualize graphs. the programs that & graphviz; are according to the program author obsolete & X11; - or & tcltk; programs with only a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kgraphiviewer; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraphiviz; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; Graphviz; programs are free layout programs. & kgraphiviz; displays graphene with all the possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & cate; and & konqueror; (such that a change in the graph in & kate; reinvents the graph and in & kgraphically;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graph in & kate; to open or to open the graph in & kgraphically; in a & kate; component</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems around 1000 knots and a hack to show more than these knot)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further required software: & kgraphically; is a & kde; program which requires the & graphviz; tool & dot; for the representation of graphs. in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in its own subwindow. initially, if you start & kgraphically; without any argument, the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot. in this case, the toolbar will only open the symbol file and open the (empty) list of last opened files. click the first icon to open the dialog File.</seg>
<seg id="733">After selecting one or more & dot; files, the main window looks like in the lower screen shot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas. you can choose a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (up and down without special buttons, left and right with pressed & alt; key);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zooming is limited in both directions by the factor 10. below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the currently loaded file has been modified by another program, the following window will appear:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose if the graph is to be reloaded or if you want to ignore the change. & kgraphically; can also note your decision, so that it will proceed as well. if you want to change your decision later, you can set up the menu item Settings kgraphically; see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you want to open a graphite file outside an ongoing & kgraphically instance, eg; in the file browser or on the command line, you have the choice if you want to open a new & kgraphically instance, or want to display the graph to be loaded in a sub-window of the current instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but also change it with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">At program start you can open all graphs of your last session again. again, you can save your choice both save as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how to split the graph to multiple pages. the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page are to be fitted to this page. in doing so, the aspect ratio will be ignored. if you keep the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a graph distributed on several pages without headline and with another font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Renewable Store page gives the possibility to specify the behavior when a file has been modified to the hard drive, and eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically recharge or ignore the changes) or let the program prompt for each time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The opening page gives the ability to specify the behavior of & kgraphically; specify a standard behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a sub-window of the already running session) or determine that each time is asked.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session administration page gives the possibility to specify the starting behavior of & kgraphically; you can specify a default behavior (open the files of the last session or not) or decide to be asked afterwards at each start.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which usually appears at a click in the main window with the & RMBn; opens up more possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose among different & graphviz; layout algorithms. the entries, as described on the web site of & graphviz, are:</seg>
<seg id="750">The algorithm sets the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short as possible edges and as few edge overlappings as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for non-generating graphs. it produces representations in accordance with the springboard model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is synonymous with statistical multidimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm creates a spring-spring model for undeveloped graphs. it uses the Frutigen-Reingold Heuristics, and includes a multi-purpose solver for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm arranges the nodes in a circle according to the description of Six und Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for specific diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Open a dialog where you can specify a layout command, which will then be executed by a shell. with such a layout command, you can use & eg; the & graphviz; algorithms to give special options, or modify the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Specifies the type of graph (directional or executed) and uses the default algorithm for the respective type (dot; for directed, & neato; for unmodified graphs).</seg>

<seg id="772">The KIPI module provides tools to read and store new images.</seg>
<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and store new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan images: use the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the Sane project or another source such as video streams. to enable this to work you have to have Kooka and Sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the menu item pictures, a dialog appears, which allows you to select between all available sources on your computer. select the source from which you want to get the picture. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window appears to replace your own image in order to select your image accordingly. see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you start scanning the image. the estimated file size will be displayed in the right, lower corner. in the Kooka manual you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure the window is fully displayed, as some settings may not be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="778">After pressing the button Scan, you have to wait until the scan is complete and the window for setting the options of the target image appears. please remember that the BMP type does not compress and therefore creates very large files. you must also select the folder & # 160; or create by saving the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">You can create screenshots after selecting the menu Importa- &gt; Screen-Photo... a window appears in which you can set the different screen modes:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select The Complete Desktop to read a single window under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="781">When all your own program windows are selected, the calling program will disappear, so that you can see other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, read the currently visible workstation. if you choose to read the complete desktop, only the window will be read under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay determines how long the screen shot is waiting before it starts. if you need to switch to other working areas, you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there.</seg>
<seg id="783">After the screen shot has been created, the dialog box options appear with the options described above.</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management on the Internet. with Flickr it is possible to send your photos to people that are important to you. you can show your favorite photos in the world, place your camera mobile photos online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family around the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The module Export to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">When using the module for the first time, you are guided by the process of generating a token, so it is used for your authentication. so, it is your reference to Flickr. a browser is started so that you can log in at Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After successfully logging in, you can send the module photos to Flickr website. you will be shown the following page after a successful login.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after you click Yes, you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the exporting module is started on Flickr for the second time, you will be welcomed with the following dialog, which displays the current access rights that the module displays. to upload, you need write permissions. the module currently supports no other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button photos should be pressed once you set all the other options. with this button, you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. when you press the Ok button, you can upload the photos to Flickr Server.</seg>
<seg id="803">The keywords field can be filled with a comma separated list of words. these are added to the image as key words during upload.</seg>
<seg id="804">With the options Public, Friends and Famillie, you can set the permissions to your images. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you choose to change the size of the photos before upload, the photos are changed before upload to size. the size is taken from the value entered at maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images. the size is changed in such a way that the aspect ratio stays constant.</seg>
<seg id="807">The KIPI Module-Export module is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server.</seg>

<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographic localization allows you to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographic data are stored in the EXIF key of the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization provides tools to locate images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as XML file in gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsp can download the data for you from your GPS device and convert.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographic localization correlation. this interface can bring together a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. the above-looking dialog appears then. to perform a possible correlation over time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file. of course, this file contains data recorded at the same locations as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed that shows the coordinates in red. GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be recalculated with the GMT. this can be done with the time zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The adjustment for the maximum time deviation gives an upper variance for the GPS time and camera time. if the deviation is below, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have a track data from one place for images, you can edit the gpx file manually and add to the pictures. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpoling and difference in minutes can be used if you have no matching data. if you know that in reality a location is in a big time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlated to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful when you have made a series of photos at the same location. as the dialogue takes the coordinates of a call to the next, you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set using the displayed map. select the region in question and increase sie.Attend this over and over again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the card can be changed between map mode, satellite image and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the images. here is a small script that uses the exifttool to provide a pile of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI Picture Gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums to a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to allow the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The panel selection allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML. you only need to select these albums. with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below will display the AlbenPreview and the text that will appear in the header of the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab displays the general look and layout for each page. this tab is largely self-explanatory. if you then click on a picture, a new page opens in which the image is displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer, eg; Kuickshow, displayed</seg>
<seg id="825">The Rider Album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your images. choose a folder on which you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLEx, which contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you choose the JPEG file format, EXIF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">You can change the default color depth with other color depth. of course, this also affects the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The rider thumbnails will allow you to adjust some of the settings from the Album Rider for thumbnails, these are small images displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window displays the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not automatically be closed. therefore, you can read the program messages to see if errors occurred during the production process.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool for viewing images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as turning, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons. it was developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is shown in full screen mode by default. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below, without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of lossless storage is that the file size is increasing because no compression of the color information takes place. this can be found e.g. in the PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI Digital Camera Client is a tool for you to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing it, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Attention: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the kde-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata module you can copy data from one image to another. then select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere but do not write in any format. JPEG is supported when writing. please check out exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodiver module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. you can also add a basic image transition between the individual images. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV file.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the chosen video format. in addition, you can choose a background color for the slide show. with this module it is possible to create DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD formats for your DVD player. finally, you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You first need to select the images to be packed into the MPEG slideshow. after that, you can create the module by extras MPEG slide show.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are then listed under image files in the Portfolio. there you can also change the images or the content of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you are planning to return the file on a TV, you must select the appropriate TV Standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds which will display a picture. the speed of the image transition is specified below. a low value creates very sudden, a high, very smooth picture change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in case of doubt, you should leave it black. you can set the name and path of the generated file with the name of the MPEG output file. keep the ending mpg as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. once you have adapted all settings to your needs, you can start the production of the movie using the coding button. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now enjoy a coffee or enjoy the slide show if you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that shortcuts or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages using the button settings to the right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the Gimp image processing.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import and convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quotation from Him is: do not expect dcraw to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file to be converted and start the module. the Raw Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image. with the button Preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance. the essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">Tagged Image Format, TIFF, keeps all information from your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you intend to edit your images frequently or later use them elsewhere, you should not choose the JPEG format since it only allows a limited number of operations before image quality is deteriorated. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is included in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start the conversion with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once. therefore, if you are secure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, they have the possibility to override existing file automatically. this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all pictures of an album. you can set the prefix, starting number and timestamp.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce or increase the image. in addition, four types of image changes are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): change of size in two dimensions. the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not Proportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Printing preparation: prepares the image for the photo print. the user can adjust the printing resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target picture, including background size, edge size and background color, will be adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the pictures window will be displayed with the images you have selected. you can add more pictures with a file selection dialog. for the last selected image, a preview of the right-hand side will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images onto the picture list and place it there to add you to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button images remove the selected pictures from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After selecting all the images you can open the new message window of your e-mail client using the OK button. you only need to add the addresses and the subject. the images selected by you are attached as attachments.</seg>
<seg id="877">Pay attention not to send too many images at once. most email accounts have limitations on the size of emails to be sent. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending images. your configuration is saved and used every time you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you will need to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you must first install the GMailAgent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in a attached file, the comments to the images are added to a text file and attached to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the Menu image file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best suited to lossless formats such as TIFF. therefore, you should use PNG if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise, we recommend you the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG image file format and the original files are in JPEG format, the original exifinformation will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not automatically shut down so that you can see the status messages, in search of errors. however, your e-mail program will automatically start at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the Advanced Diashau module, a window appears with questions like you want to show your slide show. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The option OpenGL transitions in the presentation will enable very elegant image transitions by OpenGL. however, you have to have a corresponding graphics card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">"" "the" "" "File name" "" "option ensures that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation." ""</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an infinite loop. you can then manually abort it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option pictures randomly select ensures that the images are displayed in a random order. so, it is not used to order the images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The time distance between the images can be set between the images. 1500 milliseconds are 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect. so you should test this before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select. randomly select another effect at any transition between the images.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide show, you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn on you.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar, you can pause and restart the presentation, jump to the previous and next image and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">On the left lower edge of the screen you can see the current filename, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date has currently no documentation. if you are interested in writing it, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Attention: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as a background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have annotated your images and videos with annotations, you can go with & kphotoalbum; browse through these, see picture. as you can see by comparing them with the picture, there are entries in each group, i.e. in people, places and in group keywords.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your images and videos with annotations. in addition, there are records to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current preview images. in the following, each one is described.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse on the entry, the view of the browser changes. see image.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person, only the images are shown on which both persons are visible. by this selection method, you can limit the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few individual images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the people, locations and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view the images of your sphere of action.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture, each person has the same symbol in front of her name. you can save with & kphotoalbum; however for each person to store your own preview, this also applies to places, keywords and other categories you have defined yourself.</seg>
<seg id="904">In order to display images next to the names, select the button located on the right outside of the toolbar. in the pop-up context menu, you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of people and a list of keywords (if you don't have any suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">In order to do this, you will need to open the picture-view window (in more detail) and select the category editor in the context menu. here you can adjust the picture for the appropriate person. in the view window you can adjust the magnifying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image to be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you search the search entry in the main window, a dialog appears, which is very similar to the dialog for setting the picture properties. you can view this dialog again on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the caption or description field, the captions and descriptions of the images are searched for this text. if you want, you can also specify a date to search for; the date can either be part of the total date, i.e. for example 1971, or the complete date. you can also use an area of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all images by specific names as you can see in the picture. here is shown in pictures where Jesper, but not Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum; if you don't like to read manuals, but rather want to try the same features, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the website of & kphotoalbum; and take a look at the quick entry, the screenshots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and in the first dialog, select the demo if you want to start & kphotoalbum; for the first time, or select the menu entry kphotoalbum; demo. as a result, some sample images will be loaded and you can try the features of & kphotoalbum; try.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the website of & kphotoalbum; as a contiguous HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar can be seen here:. as the name suggests, this list shows you date statistics about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">You can switch between units years, months, weeks, hours, and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively for the following ways: you can change the displayed preview view from the database (when you select a date, the first image will be displayed in the preview window) and the timeline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview window.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select an area of the timeline by holding the mouse button down and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time values. if you select an area, preview only pictures of this time period. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you two options to create HTML websites with your images. one is in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other available as module (see). in the following part of the user manual is described in & kphotoalbum; integrated version that you can create via the menu File HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages, you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas Content, Layout and Objectives. in the following, each area is described more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the overview and a description that should contain the HTML file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML sample pages see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & kphotoalbum; export file should be created to be seen on the overview page.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can choose which information to display on the HTML pages. for example, you can avoid that information is displayed without a description. for example, that all images are from a party. for example, that all images are from a party. therefore, you cannot use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area, you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why this is not specifically addressed.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. thus, those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 cannot download any images, for example, a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you set. so, he can browse your images with low resolution, leading to a lower transmission time. if he wants to get an image larger, he changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting range, specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, select the main folder where all your images will be saved. this folder will be saved and automatically added next time. this allows you to select either a folder or a protocol supported by KDE, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">Once you have created your images, you can check if they are all visible to the viewer. if you choose a URL for the base folder, a web browser after the pages are created should be started. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not in the final destination folder, you must manually copy them there. so that the import function, see, correctly you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The configuration options described above have all three to base folders or URLs. in these, a subfolder will be created, whose name you specify in output folders.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; you may, of course, create an HTML page for viewing the pictures. however, if you have spent a lot of time using the image information, people on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you must go with & kphotoalbum; do not even do this work again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kPhotoAlbum, you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. you can import them to your database.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are saved with the file or if there is only one link to the file in the file. the advantage of saving all images in the file is that you have all the pictures together and pass this file so independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kim file either directly from the File Export menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file looks for the images in two ways. first, it searches the images that are found in the .kim file. if the corresponding images are not found, the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following is a dialog for exporting images, which you can access via the Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">When you manually copy the manual to the .kim file, copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">Copying the Automatically option to the .kim file copied & photoalbum; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worthwhile to compress the files.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you may not want to send the images in full size, since the .kim file would otherwise be very large. for example, you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">When you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the Import menu... select, & kphotoalbum; import the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The importing wizard consists of four steps. first, you must select which images you want to import, then in which folders the import images should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category persons of the file to be imported (if you are a Dane) while this category is in your database people. therefore, in the third dialog window, you will be asked what categories of imported file should be imported and what categories they are in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can offset the categories of file to be imported with the categories of your current database. an example of this can be seen in the image.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse and view images: if you see pictures, you often want to jump inside different picture groups & mdash; for example, if you look at pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will pass through the various steps of (1) determining the information about your images, via (2) the browsing and prestige, up to (3) advanced themes and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum has been started as a program to manage your images. it has been expanded and today it also cares for your videos. in many places in this manual is talked about pictures, but often this includes videos.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all its information in the index.xml file in the top folder of their images. this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal Backup Tools, copy to a disk or revisions in CVS, where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; records the folder in which your images are saved and will use it automatically in future starts. if you want to read another database in & kphotoalbum; so, you can start & kphotoalbum; with the -c option. for example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / Images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Over the menu entry settings kphotoalbum; set up... go to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the user manual you will be explained the different settings options.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different icons with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting a detailed help is available, which you can access by pressing a button on the F1 key and clicking on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can set different properties for each image, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups, such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog that is used to edit existing groups. for each group you can select an inscription and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories have already been mentioned. in Dialogue Options, you can set up entire member groups, i.e. all members of a group at a time in a group, rather than all groups of a member as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the list below you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window is a list of the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; divides its modular system with other graphic applications, such as digikam and gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called via the menu module. the modules can and will not be described in this manual since they are not part of & kphotoalbum; however, most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules of several applications are shared among each other, it may be that the modules have been tested with & kphotoalbum; this is why you should always test new modules with the demo database before you apply them to your own images.</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules over KIPI are very different, making it possible that some modules with & kphotoalbum; do not work. this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications record their images in albums: an album is simply a folder. even though & kphotoalbum; this kind of order does not support, it simulates the order for albums so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">This is the current album that is just the current view, so all images that show you the picture preview right now.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, & kphotoalbum; the modules also have a list of albums. here goes & kphotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s browser shows the contents of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you set in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so if you use the category persons, for example, & kphotoalbum; do so, so if you have selected people to view and pass them on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the Settings dialog and select modules to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a starting screen as soon as you & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used to any other KDE application, you will see a menu and toolbar at the top. under the toolbar you will see the window with which you can browse your image database. in the section we will return to this window, but now click on the entry images to show you an overview of all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; this includes information about the people shown on the picture, where the picture was taken, etc. you can set each image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time. if, for example, on all pictures Jesper is shown and all images were taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these notes when using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">See three lists with a text field by setting people, locations and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; as you will always use them again when you type information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on moving images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration, and on all 50 images the same 5-10 persons are shown, you can, so that the names used are moved upwards, the persons can find and assign them faster.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click the symbol for sorting by date below the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected annotations for each image individually, you may want to edit all selected pictures and add these images with annotations. in this case, simply click on the buttons before and back, which are located under the thumbnail of the image to the right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have recorded several images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to select all these pictures and to use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">In the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as an overboard. to show you that it is an overboard, a special icon is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the note dialog, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new category or subcategory. in addition, you can also simply drag an entry into a category and put it there to make it an sub-category of this entry.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the note dialog by clicking and postpone the box that form the upper edge of the frame. you can also make a separate window from a frame by dragging it outside the window pane.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the look of the window to your needs, that you are happy with the settings, click the Options..., which offers you among other things the possibility to save the current layout and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely fade out a frame. if you want to get this window displayed later, use the Options... and then hide / hide windows here. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the images displayed in the browser, you will get an overview of thumbnails of the currently selected images, or all images if you have no filter. an example of this can be seen here. you can configure the size of thumbnails by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button. just try it.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image is set up as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this will be displayed in the picture viewer. if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the image preview. simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the Delete key or select Edit Selection in the Edit menu. now, you will see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can also use & kphotoalbum; you may have saved the images anywhere, with & kphotoalbum; you can record the images anywhere, so & kphotoalbum; in the picture you can see the view of & kphotoalbum; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures in which the right upper corner is cut is not stored on the hard disk. however, for the pictures 5-9 the thumbnails are present, so & kphotoalbum; you can also view these images with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this function requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them back into. & kphotoalbum; do not support it until now to ask for the insertion of your images. so if you want to avoid trouble on how to mess up your images, please purchase a larger hard drive to store all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu images you will find a sub-menu with the name Privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the images in such a way that at the end those you want to make for others unavailable and click Current View in the Privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="990">With this you set the images to be hidden in case of the case. if you give your laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu entry images, so all the images you have locked can be hidden. if you want to get the images displayed again, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to set a password which must be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select the password in the privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please keep in mind that this image protection is by no means very secure. on the one hand, all pictures on the hard drive and on the other can read or delete the password as unencrypted text.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you all have your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and spend hours of hours with it is natural that you want to look at them someday. for this reason & kphotoalbum; on a picture _ and video viewer. you can start from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">You can see the viewer in. of course, it shows the image, but additional all the information you have to enter via the image, such as who is on the picture, when and where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the info box on top of the picture you want to see, you can simply drag it with the mouse and put it elsewhere. you can also configure what information is displayed and if any information is available at all. all of these options are available right-click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">If you click on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all the images of Anne Helene. as if you selected people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have multiple images loaded in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and image. you can jump to the first and last image with Post1 and End. these functions are also accessible from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slide show. & kphotoalbum; loads a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of the viewer of & kphotoalbum; it is possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete place on the screen. just use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you are using the viewer you can move in and zoom into the image. to zoom out, you can just drag a rectangle with the mouse. the minus key zooms in the center of the picture. shows how a zoom angle is selected and shows the results of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button, you can reset your zoom so that the image is not zoomed. with the Sync button sets the zooms, so each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work in videos will work in and zoom out with the plus and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the turning functions from the context menu, you can rotate the picture. this does not work for videos. you can make notes on the current picture with the menu item notes from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">When you look at images it can happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten to put on the picture. at the moment you can preview the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name. however, you may prefer to mark the image and look at more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper. to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the images and mark them as good or bad while you watch one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer can provide images with features while viewing them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking the corresponding letter. see a picture in which the characters A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">As soon as you have set features on your images, they are available in your browser. so if you have any images you can edit, print or whatever you have selected, simply add all the images you need. then you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view. if you can view the categories in dre Preview view, you can add features to the pictures by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case, you will be allowed to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The batch is not saved with the image but in the database. in this way you can undo your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to complete the painting mode of & kphotoalbum; switch on the image from the context menu. to finish the painting, just press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To be able to work with & kpovmodeler; you need to master the application of the program & Povray; not complete, but the documentation too & Povray; should you have read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree, you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in object properties and the object displayed in the wiremodel views.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the object of an already selected object, since all objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the location where you want to insert the object and either click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu item in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are multiple possible positions, the following drop-down menu will be displayed so that you can choose the right position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">Deleting either from the menu bar, under Edit or from the right-click context menu, you can remove selected objects from the scene previously.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to take these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message with a fault description will be displayed. then you can correct the input errors and click Apply again or discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; - User documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can view a preview of the properties view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the properties view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. as default, the entire texture is rendered even if you want to render a part of the texture (for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), check local.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screen shot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these checkpoints with the mouse button, thus changing the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross appears in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse inside the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a visibility level as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the visibility level of the higher-level object or as absolute value. objects are displayed only when they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility stage selected in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window order or if you need a different arrangement, you can set it arbitrarily. you can also save several window arrangements and simply switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below a present view, pull the anfitter to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then displays the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the gradient to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other, pull the passer in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking the tab at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement is floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. in order to fix a view from anchoring, pull the anvil on the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left in the chamois bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the chamfering bar. to prevent closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the View menu, you will find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any point.</seg>
<seg id="1034">You can save the current window view with View window order... Save a dialog where you can save the window order under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you created a scene, you can render it. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g to render, this program must be properly installed. when this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 current. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click the Rendering icon in the toolbar or select the menu item View scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and the quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many render-modes as you like, from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or in the View Render modes menu, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it makes sense a name that lets you recognize the characteristics of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the size of the map size, you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the picture, select the check box below and enter the image section for rendering into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination field quality, you can choose the properties that use & Povray; used for rendering. this is done by a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuser reflection lighting.</seg>
<seg id="1042">When a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel, various errors can occur. these images often have a Moirè pattern or stepped effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, pictures with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of the super-sampling. as standard an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling incorporates the adjacent pixels with it. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively because each pixel is continuously split and adaptive because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray tracks a ray per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4 additional points will be calculated for a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are individually monitored and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another possibility to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process called Jittering. if you turn on jittering, change & Povray; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The final setting for the quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; which calculates diffuse light reflection. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. then a pixel is transparent when the associated rays have no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly quit, you can find the reason for it here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; scene import, select File Importing... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supported & kpovmodeler; not yet the full command range of & Povray; if error messages or warnings occur when importing error messages or warnings, a dialog box displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import, write this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds the source code of the object to the opened text file in the editor. to import objects to the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With Copy and Paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can add source code for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on Help in the Property View, open & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; User Documentation to the displayed object. here the path to your retention and the version. supported are versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example, height field data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you must also enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used to display the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the view field in the camera view and in the window type number plate.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object catch of points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and turns.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more precise wire model and thus a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects such as the ball, you can set the detail level separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">When you tick High Detailed Lofidelity for advanced projection, all wire model views are further divided, if the camera uses an extended projection. advanced Projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections. this feature gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time to render.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you tick the wall, a wall is rendered behind the objects. the wall is represented in a chessboard pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you tick the floor, a floor below the objects is rendered. the floor is represented in a chessboard pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick the edge smoothing, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can adjust the values for depth and threshold value.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window arrangements or create new window orders. in the window classifications section explains how to create and save window arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The drop-down selector standard window arrangement: shows all existing window arrangements. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The existing window arrangements display all existing window orders. a new arrangement can be created with the addition button and deleting a selected arrangement with the button Delete.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window order is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name shows all views for the selected window order. new views can be created with the addition button and deleting selected views with the button Delete.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The new column will create a new column on the right-hand side of the existing window, with Unten anchor the window under the existing window, with tab, you get a map view together with the previous view and hovering the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without a more precise knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, very popular among beginners: a sphere on a level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen. if you are using a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules can be applied for rendering, as a result you get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert any light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed all error-free, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following pre-set window order:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing toolbars. please read the documentation so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you first have to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Delete. so you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene you create. in particular, you will notice that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the term camera. if you click on it, you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera are found. in the user documentation to & Povray; see for more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera has control points in the view that you can change the focus point of the camera. simply click on a control point and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the application button or the input button, the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see here the scene from the point of view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. for example, you could insert a straight (insert finite body Quader) and adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a complicated method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually offers a simpler way. you can use an infinite plane as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and press the Apply button or enter the input button. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wiretop view now also displays the level, although at the moment only as a limited infinite plane. when you render the scene, the plane extends up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you look at the object tree, you will find that you can fold the item for the bottom by clicking on the + in front of the object. in this case you will only see the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shifting.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the floor to the exercise unit under the horizon line, only in order to get to know some of these parameters. choose shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but at the moment select something simple.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog opens in which you can select how to insert the object. please choose first object. the pigment is then displayed in the property view (name = ground-pigment), with a click on the button preview, see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigment is just a matt black material, because you still need to re-enter the pigments. just remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time by clicking on the thumbnail.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you do not see a color on the header and the ball in the preview, just click the Apply button and then preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color you expected. in the color list you need to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more often, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, choose one color each time and change the colors in the view of the properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should be able to do this step by simply because you have already understood the basic behavior of & kpovmodeler; the ball can be just as simple as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (do not forget to press the input button or the button Apply), so the ball has contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball would float above the ground as you have moved the bottom around one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Naturally, the rendering now results in a strange result: as already before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. in the following step, set a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">When you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as already on the ground, give the ball a pigment as a color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select first object and change the name for example in sphere pigment. click on sphere pigment, then select Incoloured and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects when you take the time to adjust some finishing properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screen shots and click Apply or press the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings gloss effect and reflection already result in good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metal: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good idea of what possibilities you & kpovmodeler offers; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracing is a Render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you raytracing a scene, the render will shoot hypothetical rays from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) through each pixel in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source you don't see anything, the image is just black. obviously, every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog, you can select a file that you previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file is inserted into this submenu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be saved on the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and memory space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restore the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage are discarded.</seg>

<seg id="1120">Repeat the last command. this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit Undo.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Save the current window order and open a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or override an existing configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, shortcut and default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcut. with this option you can add pre-set short commands for & kpovmodeler; change commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up toolbars. you can add and remove tool symbols for & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1125">A dump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each bump on the surface individually and without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a dump map as well as a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic shapes are simple geometric shapes you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are made of dozens or even hundreds of these basic shapes. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on a pixel basis by using an image file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be shown either in a window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & cuickshow; is very easy. the file browser lists files you can use by clicking the & LMBn; or the return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general functions that are mostly found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlist browsers and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and & kde; in addition, Amarok has some own command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give a feedback to the user if the script can't be executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script if all required modules are present and use the kdialog to make the user know why a script doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Korundum' rescue LoadError 37 = 'Corundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script.' 'dialog --sorry' # {error} '' exit</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use it as a base for your own scripts or simply expand it to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should be included in any KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow the execution of external programs and commands. this mostly uses the exec () function. in this way dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends notifications to all current scripts. for this purpose strings are written to the default setting of the script. for this reason, scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can ignore events even if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Weist the script to display the setup dialog. to store and store the setup data, each script must take care of itself. if a script is started, Amarok relies on the folder where all the data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signalizes that a new piece is being played. the script could now and zb; with DCOP functions you could ask for more information about the new item (for example, the metadata or the length of the unit).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newVolume signals a change in volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Customizing MenuClicked: submenu itemTitle paths Contains the path to the selected playlist files when a custom menu item is clicked. to add an entry, you can use the dCOP function dcop Amarok script addCustomMenuItem (submenu itemtitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; stop, or if the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the SIGTERM signal to the script. this signal should be processed to perform, for example, clearing up data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.bz2), which can optionally also be detected with bzip2 (.bz2).</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the cataboliscript. for this reason, you should rename your script packages right away.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules to be loaded should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file rights:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can attach it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki scripts page of & Amarok; for your entry on kde-apps should use the category Amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to go through endless menus. maybe you are looking for a very specific song from thousands in your collection. with & Amarok; 's collection browser and quick search, you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Maybe you already have some playlists, but you can never decide which one you want to hear? then the playlist is just the right thing for you. and if you still have difficulty deciding, dynamic mode and smart playlists will automatically select the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers ifp and many generic USB devices. besides, many different audio systems can be used so YOU can choose how to listen to your music. Amarok is intelligent, sexy and chic - just the right way to rediscover your music!</seg>
<seg id="1204">Usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amarok sources to compile and install Amarok:</seg>
<seg id="1205">Da & Amarok; autoconf and automake used, you should not have any trouble with compiling. if you encounter problems, please report them to the & kde; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& Amarok; like most applications, has some options to enable or disable the configure-time point with the configure script. this is a list of available options.</seg>
<seg id="1207">For some of the compiling options certain dependencies must be met so that they can be used. see the system requirements section for details.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Activates debugging symbols. you have the choice between yes, no and full. if you want to help in the development of & Amarok; help, you should use full.</seg>
<seg id="1209">& Amarok; runs through the setup dialog without difficulty. the setup dialog has several flashcards for setting up the various functions of & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1210">In addition to the player window, the player window will also turn on / off the playlist. if the option is off, only the playlist window will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Use moods barometer: this function is only available if & Amarok; compiled with Moodle support. the option turns the experimental function of the moods barometer.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Shaping the mood: this function is only available when & Amarok; compiled with Moodle support. this changes the color scheme used for the mood barometer.</seg>
<seg id="1213">When this setting is enabled, .mood files will be stored at the location of the appropriate music files. otherwise, the .mood files will be stored in the settings folder of & Amarok; stored (usually ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / moodbar /).</seg>
<seg id="1214">External Browser: lets you choose which browser from & Amarok should be started when a browser is required.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Use other browsers: here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above.</seg>
<seg id="1216">Save playlists when you exit, automatically save the current playlist to the end of & Amarok;. enable this option if you don't want to lose the current playlist at the end of the end.</seg>
<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually stored playlists: when you enable this setting, & Amarok will use; relative paths to the music files, starting from the location of the playlist, use. otherwise, the absolute position of the music files will be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Visible piece changes visible when changing the playlists to keep the playlists window up / down to keep the current piece in the visible area of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1219">Changes to the context browser automatically display the context browser as soon as the next piece is played.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section you can customize & Amarok; s appearance. the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the Fonts section you can set the use of different fonts in & Amarok; select by selecting custom fonts, the otherwise grey section will be activated. you can select fonts for the following area: playlist windows, player windows and context browsers. press Select..., so you can choose a font from the selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1222">With the choice of Custom color scheme, you have the spoilt of choice and you can set your own color scheme. use the color selection below for foreground and background color.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Resume playback at start means that & Amarok; after program start resume playback automatically with the piece at the place with which it was stopped at the last stop.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The On-Screen display enables you to switch on the OSD. when on-screen display is connected, a preview of the OSD is displayed and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview directly.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click select... to select the font for the OSD from the dialog. the check box shadow causes the text to be shaded in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Using your own colors gives you the possibility to adjust the OSD colors for writing and background. a click on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection. if own colors are not enabled, the default colors will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The display text input field displays the text displayed in the OSD. by entering wildcards the OSD can be adapted to your own needs. below you will find a list of available placeholders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The screen option is designed for Xinerama users, allowing you to set the OSD to appear on which screen of a multiple monitor environment.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The Audio output box allows you to select an audio driver from the drop-down field. some drivers will activate further settings in this map.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The collection box collection is used to set up all settings for your collection, including the folder and the type of database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folders, the & Amarok; search for music files. to include a folder in the collection, mark the check box next to its name. this section also contains check boxes to set up how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Search subfolders recursively: this causes that & Amarok; both the selected and their subfolders will be searched for music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitor changes: allows & Amarok; to monitor the selected folders to changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). in addition, incremental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import Playlists: causes & Amarok; all found playlists added to your collection folder (.pls- and .m3u files) to your collection. the automatically added playlists will appear later in the playlist browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The part collection database is used to select a database for the collection. the combination field driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further device in the sub-window MySql is required.</seg>
<seg id="1236">The MySql device section is used to set up the database for & Amarok; under Calculator: enter the host on which the MySql database is located. then the network port is entered under which the database is accessible. name: is the database name to which the connection is established.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Use Username: and Password: to enter the data you need to connect to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1238">The file last.fm establishes the support for last.fm. & Amarok; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last.fm server and if necessary create music recommendations for the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1239">Here you enter your username and password for your Last.fm profile. if you do not have a profile, you can register one on the last.fm website.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Send played pieces and update the profile: this setting makes it possible & Amarok; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last.fm profile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">Invoke similar performers: after activating this setting, & Amarok; a list of similar performers to the played piece. you can view the list in the context browser. note: you do not need a last.fm profile to use this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (such as & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the package kdelibs and no other KDE packages. so you have to have kdelibs installed (including the included programs, because & Amarok; needs some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small guide how to compile kdelibs minimally.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some features such as the OSD assume that your window manager will keep up the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. Gnome will work, for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt, as these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Most likely, one of your files will make a mistake in the TagLib library for days. please report this error to the TagLib developer on bugs.kde.org and also append the broken file that causes the crash. afterwards, you can delete the file and let the collection again be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Most of the time this is because tagliad crashes when reading meta information from this file. please report this error to the TagLib developers at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for it in & Amarok; is a bit more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all of the used libraries have been compiled with the same compiler version. if, for example, & Amarok; compiled with GCC 3.4, TagLib but with GCC 3.3.X, this results in crashes when editing the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then disable autom. disable when inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least do not use a value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace (the e-mail will automatically open during a crash). if this is a frequent crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error will be fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 into the meta-information, but don't label them as Unicode. the following Perl script resolves the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the "file $ARGV [0] does not exist" unless -f $ARGV [0]; use MP3:: Mplib; my $mp3 = MP3:: Mplib; my $mp3 = MP3:: Mplib [0]\ "unless $MP3- &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>
<seg id="1253">This script requires the Perl module MP3:: Mplib. it can be reinstalled with this command: Perl -MCPAN -e 'install MP3:: Mplib'</seg>
<seg id="1254">& Amarok; s symbols in the status bar (random mode / repetition / dynamic playlist) are always active in KDE 3.4.0. sometimes the status deactivates in grey and semi-transparent. note that in some cases, you have to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1255">If you get this error: amarokapp: symbol lookup error: catamarapp: undefined symbol: _ ZN11KSystem Tray9setPixmapERK7QPixmap, please check if Amarok is using the correct Qt library. this can be seen with ldd 'which amaroapp' _ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this error, you may need to remove any conflicting Qt version or / etc / ld.so.conf so that Amarok will find the correct version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">There are several options. most installation issues are most easily solved by the help of an expert using your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search for help with other users or developers. use the forum and IRC under irc.freenode.net in the # Amarok channel.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugzilla is not suitable for searching for help. please only use a bug there if something is wrong with the fixing of a bug in Amarok itself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & Amarok; only an empty playlist appears.</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is easy. use the file browser on the left-hand side and open the folder you want. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To keep the surface intuitive, the start subwindow has been converted into the statistic window. you will find it under Extras statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars stand for rating by the user while the points are calculated automatically.</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the Alsa sink, the device has to provide a mixer. a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and to simultaneously stream audio. this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer (e.g. SBLive) or by the dmix module for Alsa (software mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and a solution. for GStreamer, you may need to specify a different Sink (for example, sink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">You can't just send an MP3 to ALSA, you would only hear a white noise. GStreamer is the best choice for most people if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead. GStreamer reads the file, decodes it and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Even XMMS decodes the data first. GStreamer can output directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open sound server with highest priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of the sound buffer (warning, see the next point of the FAQ!). make sure that artswrapper SUID is set:</seg>
<seg id="1277">With KDE 3.2.x there are problems with KDE multimedia codecs that can cause disturbed playback. read this error report. enlarge the sound buffer in your ALSA setup file .asoundrc can also help.</seg>

<seg id="1335">The player window is your one-click & Amarok; control center. at the top of the window is a disk display showing the currently running track or current stream. directly below is the area, the playing time, bit rate and samplerate of the current play. a click on this area changes the display of the already expired playing time to the remaining play time of the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the player window contains a selection of audio-analyzers, also under the drive text display. you can change by using the available Analyzer by clicking on the area with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the player window. hit d on your keyboard and the current analyzer is displayed in an independent, extensible window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">The PL and EQ buttons are also displayed under the running text display. the PL button activates or deactivates the playlist window, while the EQ button is used to set up Equalizer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the play buttons, the volume control and the play position slider. use the slider to adjust the play position or volume. with the playback buttons, you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">The use of the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets, from Classic to Techno, and you can easily create your own presets.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To display the equalizer, use Extras Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you select the Equalizer check box, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The Playlist of & Amarok; is the most advanced playlist of all for & kde; available multimedia player. it has many features that do not exist in any other player. but don't let the abundance of functions deter you, they're all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlist window can be divided into two main areas, on the left side is the navigation area. in the navigation area, you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist, such as the context browser.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser displays different information regarding the current piece. its appearance can be adjusted with the help of context-browser designs. the context-browser contains three subwindows: music, text and artist. these three subwindows will later be explained in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have used earlier versions of & Amarok; used, you might notice that the sub-window has dropped. the information displayed there has now been distributed to other parts of & Amarok; in addition, the information in the statistics window can be viewed (Extras statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music sub-window displays information about the currently running piece, as well as the artist and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first area in this sub-window displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz icon. click on this icon to track the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">The MusicBrainz icon gives you more information about the current play. you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To display cover images in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png will be preferred. the context browser will also display cover images embedded in either the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces it will play immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this performer. this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can choose which information should be displayed in the music subwindow. right-click anywhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the artist, lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will work up and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all the pieces in each area to start playing immediately. you can also right-click on it and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist by right-click and then from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">In the subwindow text, the downloaded lyrics are displayed for the current piece. this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self-written scripts. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, try to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if no text script is running, you can choose which should be started.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the modified version will then be stored in & Amarok; s collection database. no running text script is required.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Search button opens a search on google.com for the running piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Artist - only group the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the performer. albums or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Artist / Album - First of all the pieces will be sorted according to the artist and below will be a further division after the respective album. if you want to see constellations or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Different Artists.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping Artist / year - Album - Sorted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (newest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is used.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabetically by each other. the performer is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping Genre / Interpret - Your pieces will first be sorted by genre and, among them, by artist.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping Genre / Artist / Album - This setting works as well as the above, but is additionally sorted by album below the performer.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons you can adjust and combine grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically re-record your collection once you change something to the selected folders. if you own a lot of pieces, it might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">A search filter is located directly beneath the toolbar. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. for use of this filter, see the section on the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The search filter contains a selection box with which you can filter the last added pieces to your collection. you can choose from the last 24 hours up to a year. of course, you can also select your entire collection, so that the filter is switched off virtually.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser, you will get the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This empty the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Append to playlists - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry, you will reach the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces in queue - This function will add the selected pieces to the queue. this will play you next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist. they are asked for a name under which the list should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transfer Media Player - Add the pieces into the queue for transfer to the media player. for more details, see the section on the media player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1374">All pieces of this interpreter will burn / burn to CD - This will send the selected pieces to K3b and burn either as a data or audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - Opens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(s) move files to the trash bin... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Mark the selected album as a compilation, whereupon it appears under different interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1378">List Markup - Change the album marked as a compilation back to a normal album. after that the album will no longer be displayed under different interprets, but again under the associated interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlists browser is easy to use with many playlists. among other things, it also includes smart playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The bottom part of the playlist's browser contains the smart playlists. they use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists for runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist containing the pieces in your collection that has never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Also self-created smart playlists are possible. just click on Smart playlist to open the dialog for creating a new Smart playlist. there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The subwindow media player will be used for the connection of & Amarok; for example your iPod with & Amarok; for example your iPod with & Amarok; be included in / mnt / ipod. if & Amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod after performer sorts in the upper list view of the media player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list Interpret. if you are done, click Apply. thus, the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod. if the transfer is complete, quit y & Amarok; and solve the drive connection for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Among the toolbar is a search area with which you can search for a file. search is especially useful in folders with very many files, because all the files in the file list are hidden, which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser is an address bar with which you can fetch music from a entered URL. if you enter for example tar: / home / mike / musik.tar.gz, you can access music in the music .tar.gz. now you can drag the music from there into the playlist and let it fall.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, the attachment of files can be difficult by simply dropping down. in that case, holding down the shift key can be helpful: this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list, and not at the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">You can change the order by simply drag the entries with the mouse to the desired place. as soon as you enter the letters, only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed. to reset the filter, press the back button until the text box is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter through spaces separated search terms, & Amarok; search for entries containing all search terms. for example, if you enter one two, the search will find all the entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you enter a OR between the search terms OR, search for entries containing either one or the other search term. for example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces containing one or two or three (or a combination thereof) are found.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries that contain spaces, then complete the search term with Griffon feet: Mike Oldfield. this will search for entries that contain Mike Oldfield, but not for entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a specific search column, you can also search for bigger or smaller. for example: rating: &gt; 50. This looks for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term, put a minus sign in front of the search term: -something looks for pieces that do not contain something.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variants as you like. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bad. this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield, or a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the sequences of entries by holding down the Ctrl key, and then right-click in the desired order on the entries. the entries will then receive a label with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The playlist's toolbar is located at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist. on the left hand side, you will find the Add button that you can add to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons will follow undo and restore, so you can undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the middle of the toolbar there is a unique, magnified analyzer. the refresh rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button in the toolbar is menu. it opens the same menu as the one you want to display in the Player window over the right mouse button. over this menu you can set up & Amarok; 's configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many more buttons available for the toolbar, for example playback controls and volume control. you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and setting up toolbars... select.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information on the playlist. it displays the title of the current play, the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces. furthermore, the status for shuffle mode and retrieval can be easily changed by clicking twice in the corresponding display area with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. to do this, disable the status bar flag in the General Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking on the menu in the playlist. above this menu, you can reach the settings of & Amarok;</seg>

<seg id="1405">This entry hides a sub-menu with links to this document and other information about & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1406">The cover administration is a useful tool to manage your cover images. you can start it by selecting actions cover administration in your collection browser.</seg>
<seg id="1407">The cover management contains a list view of all albums in your collection. you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the artist on the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="1408">With the View menu, you can choose what should be displayed in the cover administration. select from:</seg>
<seg id="1409">The queue management received your big move in & Amarok; 1.3. with this feature you will have more control over the playlist. after you set a piece into the queue a number is displayed next to the title. this number represents the order in which & Amarok; the pieces will play: 1 will play first, 2 as second, and so on.</seg>

<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, as many others & kde; applications also equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality can, for example, be controlled via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; functions, you can either use the dcop command line program or the somewhat more convenient Kdcop program. both programs are identical in the range of functions, so your taste and the style of your task is crucial to which of the accompanying programs you give preference.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you use the dcop command line program. to use the & DCOP; functions you need to make sure that & k3b; then type something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions that have all & kde; program have in common, supported & k3b; mainly two other parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; provides features such as copyCD, format DVD and other features for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">Void copyrif () DCOPRef createVideoCDProject () DCOPRef createVideoCDProject () DCOPRef createVideo DVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoCD Project () DCOPRef createVideo DVDProject () void copyCd () void copies void burnCdImage (KURL url) void burndvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively, you can obtain a project using the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then get a reference to the project using the # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which is only applicable to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (Qstring name) void createFolder (QString) void addUrl (KURL:: list urls, QString) void removeItem (Qstring path) void renameItem (Qstring path, QString NewName) void setVolumeID (QString id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then adds files to the new folders:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT $PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder fillurl / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; reader for & kde; with it can easily be read audio CD; s can be read out and stored in MP3 or OGG files. other formats are also possible, depending on the encoder installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on the hard disk) and by many encoding that encode these WAV files. currently, lame for MP3, oggenc for Oggs and FLAC (lossless compression) is supported by default.</seg>
<seg id="1496">First the title of the & CD; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files (usually one per titles) are compressed into the mp3 or OGG format or also in other formats like the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, it is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other coders must be installed. all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distributions, so it is very likely not necessary to compile it yourself. however, if FLAC is not used, its installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format should be used? the chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction about codifiers, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, use & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia for reading the audio data from the & CD; it is not possible to read any copy protection. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device, it is not possible to circumvent any copy protection.</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only needs to be performed (the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found), the daily handling for reading a & CD is explained. this leads (hopefully) to the understanding of the slim approach of the user interface, which you will often stumble across at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which encoding programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; retrieving information from the freedb from the internet or can work completely without network, where everything is manually recorded.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the main window commands. on the page step by step example, you will find more information about how this program is used and screenshots with descriptions of the tabs for the configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Starts the CDDB request of the CD-data according to the setup of request in the CDDB tab. (this can be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be made.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - if an encoder has been configured in the Code of Configuration tab in the Setup dialog - the encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoders, so that the selection can be read with another encoder as the default. it is to be noted that previously the encoder was configured in the Configuration dialog in the Configuration dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Open the file manager so that an already read file is selected for encoding rather than a full & CD; read and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notifications (such as protocols, picks) for program events (such as reading the & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog of & kaudiocreator; with various flashcards (such as encoder, to set up the encoder). here you need to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoding and compression rates and helps you choose the right encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a loss-free audio format is required. besides FLAC there are also other such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate the differences become less important since both coders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame is nevertheless supplied free with most distributions, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly lower quality with lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playsets is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special auto-stereo equipment. today - initially 2009 - these devices mostly support only MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has already quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good enough for music by young people, portable devices and car stereo systems. but not good enough for better stereo hi-fi systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information fetched manually or fetched from the freedb via the Internet is available in the program as a list of parameters. you can be passed / used with & kaudiocreator; and the encoding program to create the folder and file name as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the coprocessor and these parameters here. the manual or the help of the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add title to the keyword (English: tag) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the -tt of lame and the title parameter of & kaudiocreator; added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= appendix in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database, in which people can read / enter the audio CDs, so that all others can download this information instead of themselves into the machine. it is to be noted that only text is spoken here: & CD; title, artist, name of pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (editor's note) is not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from issuing information publicly available on the CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed. all information can be obtained from a stroll through a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is actively used to select a check box (send an address). in this way of configuration, it appears, the email address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (this can only know the programmer who checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server needs to be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and compensates the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retrieval of & CD; information while reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to save pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used; if you want to know more exactly, search the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see note that the cdparanoia package needs to be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this is not done yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the read WAV files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. when opening, predefined lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) are available on the tab for setting up the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The codec package must be installed by the concerned Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also required for pre-defined coders. more information on the coders can be found in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder, you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; Console). in doing so, 'lame' must be replaced by the name of the installed encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, writing and reading real on it and whether both cdparanoia as well as the audio encoding of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want a copy-protected audio CD; check the sleeve of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you are using other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood all, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you'll get enough information to set up those areas that let the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will launch the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps average and ID3V1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">You need to have cdparanoia and lame installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can, for example, be found with a search engine, as it is considered not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission (eg; attempting to copy something into it).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic set-up of & kaudiocreator; something that is probably done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure for reading a & CD; what has to be repeated for each reading & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoding to be used for compression of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps).</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we are most likely not going to change it every time you read a & CD; once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is handed over to the reading program so it can read the & CD; data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, a look at the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for the CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">There is not much to do here. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example everything is left / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Just select in case of incomplete information, so that you will be informed when information about creating keywords (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The CD; Settings. just select both entries. we are comfortable and leave the CD; data can be downloaded automatically via the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the Internet to access the freedb server while reading the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second drop-down field is easier, if a & CD is found; this is associated with low risk if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, you can easily change the directory or filename, and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, keep in mind: if you want to enter all manually, deactivate the selection fields and freedb will not be used. however, if you download the database before. however, this is above 620 MB in size, consider this twice whether this is worthwhile. to freedb in offline mode, you must select the two selection fields, at least the first.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data inquiry, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freedb server via the Internet. how does the system know which data is to get the CD? read the section on freedb. set everything as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to the freedb.org site and look for a mirror server near you. on this way, the load is distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work simultaneously as far as the server is concerned, as many firewalls are bucking the protocol 8880 by default, there may be more luck with the 80, since the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we do not want to transmit data to the freedb server. deactivate the first check box.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of concurrent pieces: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author does not know, therefore simply try himself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; discard after reading the last piece: check this to the & CD; to discard at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, you / must specify the path / folder in which the wav files are stored. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. don't forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Set everything as it is on the screen shot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something must be browsed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is sufficient for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is on average about 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the generation of tags to V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted when needed. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of WAV files to be codified at the same time: with a dual core or quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine, it can be tried to encode more than one WAV file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic set up of & kaudiocreator; this configuration is used as a standard for every reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wisely, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section it is described as the process of reading the & CD; we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, was described in the previous section and furnished. first, a connection to the Internet is built, since we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freedb.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not yet included in freedb, the screenshots look somewhat different from the data fetched from freedb. therefore, you will learn the & CD; data manually instead of retrieving them from the internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet done, the & CD must now be inserted into the drive defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screenshot. this only when the & CD; as an audio CD; can be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, look in the questions and answers to the help section or go back to the previous section on the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD has been successfully picked up by the freedb, all titles of the pieces are already filled in and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; -key for your & CD; a window will be displayed, and you can select the database entry, which in your opinion best fits your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you did not select the check box for the automatic retrieval of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have a local database, but get the data from the internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD-Editor - Input of the CD-data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your CD; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Current Title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer has to be entered in the "Current Title" input field unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The comment field of the album can be used for the individual comments, the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Note: after successful retrieval of the data from freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name (e.g. whether all words with capital letters begin or not...), but also to check if there are any undesired comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment area. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least to what & kaudiocreator; maximum allowed.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later with tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also recreate ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders or file formats. see the help of the encoder for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Just choose an entry that obviously matches the style of the end-of-the-fly CD; in this example, this is not important as we do not transmit the information anyway. for more information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">"" "after choosing" "" "OK" "" "you come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece." ""</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor will appear again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the input data we recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD; enter.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Note: this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button on the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are shown above the BOM.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. a simple click on the line will switch off the selection of the piece, or press the All items button at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">If the reading process is started by clicking on the button selection process, this window appears for confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab orders to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the jobs. the first piece is currently read on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message you will see if you are trying to work with a codicator you haven't installed yet. pieces that have not been successfully encoded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we typed here in the example. have you checked if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the first piece's reading.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3. this makes reading and coding in parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that appears to be configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read while another piece is encoded and a third order is placed in the queue of the encoder. after encoding the last piece, a small window with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator;, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece will automatically start as soon as you drag it to the & kmid; (in several pieces it will be added to a collection and then played successively.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">As soon as & kmid; play a piece, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and running down and down with the slider.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click on the arrows left and right of the template and change the playing speed. to get back the original tempo, double-click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a play is played, a pressure on the space bar, like pressing a button, or selecting the menu entry break in the menu, interrupts playback. press the space bar while no play is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use lyrics event and others both. some pieces do not have any text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid, you can set what events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically calculated, which a song is used, so that you don't have to manually set it. however, if you select automatic text selection in the Settings menu, the Karaoke text is automatically selected. however, you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set an event type, select the text events or song events from the Settings menu. the same function also have the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summarize. in this section you can see how to efficiently use collections.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, open the collection manager first. you will find it in the menu Collection under the point Organize.... Click here on New and specify the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copy and then specify the name for the new collection. in the beginning, this collection will contain the same songs as the original ones.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the winnings in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When you exit the application, this collection is not stored. remember, if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager, where you can add a song by adding the Add button. it appears again the file dialog with which help you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the automatic addition to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic addition to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If Automatically add to the collection is not enabled, the temporary collection will be activated and emptied when opening a piece. this collection will then be added to the pieces that are still open.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you must open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the sequence from the sub-menu sequences of the menu collections, the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the drop-down list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select the next song, next song from the menu item, or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the button Previous piece, the item Previous item from the menu item or press the arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to be deleted and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted, but it does not matter since it is not saved when leaving.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers that are not general-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-map translates General-MIDI Events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI-map that converts all Change patch to Bright piano events into the Events of the Change patch to Trumpet type, making it sound like a trumpet, if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you don't need a MIDI-Map because all sound cards are GM-compatible (including Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI-Maps, so you have to edit the appropriate file from your hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all required replacements for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, it is a prerequisite for each occurrence to have a different TextID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define keymap "Name of keymap"... END Define keymap "A further keymap"... END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as email so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can provide for devices that are not general-MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section shows how the patches are mapped from General MIDI to your specific keyboard. general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equation sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">For example, if your keyboard does not support a gun shot (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60) which sounds similar to a gun. to do so, enter the following into the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file should play a note with Patch 127 (gun shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that the term Trommel patch is meant to represent a different percussion instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the tone means the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards possess).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to indicate how tones are shown on a specific channel or instrument. use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you must create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to map sound to the percussions channel. for example, take a look at the included keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to exchange the first and second channel, simply make it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel shown on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the Keymap must be defined with the name Name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which attempt to change the patch on this channel. in this case, always patch x is used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch can be useful for example to always use the percussions patch on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio specifies in which pitch Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch Bender Event with the value n, this is converted to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then relayed. the value 4096 is used to prevent decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM has a keyboard that will play a pitch-Bender-Event with the value 4096 to play a note higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards attempt to play two tones up to one octave. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI-Map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. this can be found in the menu under Settings, Spot MIDI Settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you can see which sounds are played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel, there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed one instrument, the button lights no more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (until now) has two different views to display the played tones. view the view from the Settings menu under the point Channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The pace-LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so if you find, for example, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, & etc;. this allows the same MIDI file to perform very different results on two different devices, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you get a similar sound quality.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen when you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's home page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree to support & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all the files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Make sure to enable automatic addition to the collection previously. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow button on the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow down playback. to restore the standard tempo, you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & konqueror; -Desktop with my MIDI-folder and & kmid; on this desktop (when I play a MIDI file) or if I want to play a file, only switch to the & konqueror; -window and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid; pull.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection, turn the automatic addition to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files A.Schmid, B.mid and C.mid. first, you just want to play the first file. so, set the setting Automatic add to the collection and open A.amid. your temporary collection then contains exactly those a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard, it animates me to program on & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; Laga (Spain). I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; Laga. at the moment I'm studying programming, collecting MIDI files, making music and propositions.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you just want to make me happy, write me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really enjoy a great joy when sending me a postcard from your home or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will count among friends of & kmid; but before you send a MIDI file, you should contact me, because I may already have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; completely written in my spare time and won't get any money from anyone. I would like to point out that I'm just re-programming because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch of AWE cards was too high.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks also to Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the AWE support, Ignacio Garcia for testing AWE support, Has Petter Bieker, Ola Sigurdson, Peter Gritsch, Peter-Paul Witta, Thorsten Wesselder, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, error message or even a supportive e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the net that give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition can be found on his homepage, which is located under http: / / www.aragonis.es / ~ rlarrosa / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, look for information and view images. you will also find links to sites with other karaoke songs, & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you do not have a sound card, you must compile & kmid; compile with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you had a sound card, except that you cannot of course hear music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If you have any problems, contact one of the & kde; -Mailinglists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple interface for MPlayer, Phono and ffmpeg. the program is used to play video files supported by MPlayer or phonon supported formats, as well as to play DVD s, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The Documentation for & knot; was not finished as & kde; installed on this computer.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help please check the page The KDE's website for new versions, or send the question to The & kde; User Mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is a window with the playlist. and finally there is an information window that is only displayed when information is returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save preferred connections under the Bookmark menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category Lasting Playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level. if you select an entry, its group and all its sub-groups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The different files in directory ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer /, can be changed by an editor, but also by the application itself. simply click on a name of a category, choose from the View menu and next edit mode. by clicking a subgroup, only the XML content of this part will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you need to choose from the Edit menu and select either the editing mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes will be lost when you leave edit mode or select another group without matching the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files..</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayer errc and modify [General Options] No Intro = 0 above option to '1'. if the option is not present, it can be easily inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; will note files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during starting doesn't need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. however, this would be annoying in the end-animation, so the user can end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation may be the viewing of a favorite photos: & lt; & lt; img dur = "ing; src =" fit = "meet" / gt; & lt; / body.gif "fit =" meet "/ gt; /;; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; /;; & lt; /;; & lt; /;; & lt; /;; & lt; /;; & lt; /;; & lt; /;;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for MPlayer configuration in the Configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the 'Console' button in the tool bar of KMPlayer. here the output of mplayer can be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this playback device in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; everything must be configured through manual editing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc, such as setting up the backend by mimetype. here is an example of a 'flash' played with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & KMPlayer; it can even include the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">For the & KMPlayer; 'flash' to play in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module as service provider for the mime-type application / x-shockwave-flash in the setup dialog boxes of KDE must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; can be started in a console application and searched for error messages concerning loading the browser module library. if no errors occur here, the backend output is within & KMPlayer; (View, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">So that a given backend for a specific mime type is always taken (of course only if this is also determined), this must be done by changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayer errc. for example, phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play from TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be watched, the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured. to do this, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog, or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialogue can be found in the settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo port. there, ports should be detected by which one is selected (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a dvb in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support from KMPlayer can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this way of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the videoforlinux extension for the X server must be functional. for the XFree86 server, the following must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, KMPlayer uses different names for the sources. at the time of the creation of this documentation, these are dvdnavsource, dvdsource, exitsource, introsource, pipesource, tvscanner, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource and vdrsource. when enabled, they start playing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Is there any hints on how to make my CDROM drive quieter when I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom can be run as user root after the device is inserted. it is absolutely certain that / dev / cdrom is on the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine only starts up slowly, why does my CPU need to be checked for performance every time?</seg>

<seg id="1768">File surveillance: in this mode, the DVI; file is transferred to the file, and there is no call from & eyepiece; after the quick construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the Edit toolbar, the three large selection boxes should be picked up. the selection fields have been developed for quick insertion of common elements into the document. the first drop-down field is for quick outline of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex; commands for subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The Other is for items such as key words, notes notes or references. the available possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command a name for a section, a picture or any other element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: used for reference to a defined name (selection via a selection field possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">The author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & bibtex; and & bibtex; the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & bibtex; files can also be written in & Kile; by hand also.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-down field with the name GrÃ ¶ Ã ¼ ck is used for determining the font size. it can be specified the font sizes for the main text, the notes notes, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & Kile, two choices are available: 1. the Wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and setting the settings.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The parentheses under the command\\ Documclass contain the settings for the command. setting [12pt] specifies the font size. if the font file is not specified at the beginning, this can also be done in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code example has been typed, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is to use the MenÃ ¼ s Build or the Fastener button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored before compiling. & Kile; automatically executes the storage.</seg>
<seg id="1779">Failure to compile the document should be looked for in logging after errors. when using fast construction, & Okular should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (engl.environment) is a text which is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font ramp 12 is created and only a few columns should have another font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} will then allow the change of font sizes within the environment â €(English Huge).</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are only supervised within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}. there is no restriction (number) for changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the legibility and usability of the document. for example, certain fonts, bold printing, italics, submissions etc. can be added. these commands end with the\\ end command or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is valid for italics and stays closed until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or any other environment. a single word in a set can be italic displayed with\\ emph {Word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ ratio: creates a quote in the document. the quote begins with\\ begin {quote} and ends with\\ end {quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Following the writing of the source code with the & latex; markup language, a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & Kile follows.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once a bit of text has been entered in the wizard, a few adjustments should be made for the better readability of the document. at least one quote, a few places in the bold and italic pressure and a poem may come to the application in order to see the differences in these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, the editor-view or Ctrl E can return to the editor (for the internal viewer). in an external viewer its windows have to be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI-file has been created, the document can be printed out or converted to a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try it out and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a common file format (engl. D e V ice I nr.). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi outputs such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file the same steps are necessary as for the creation of the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed using the file print (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI-file from the & latex; source text was created, the conversion into changed other formats can begin using the knobs in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The preliminary search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; provides an appropriate setting for all & latex; -Binder files. to do so, simply set up the modern under Settings box... Tools building should be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To execute the default search, the mouse cursor must be positioned in a line of the source text and clicked on pre-select search. the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI; viewer is then done.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & Okular; with one click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; document by & Kile; opened and jump to the corresponding line. to do this, & Kile; in & eyepiece; used as text editor (set settings eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If the & DVI does not open, an error may be available. if there is an error, this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file tells the error source in the source code. in the editor you can then specify the flaws of the LaTeX errors and the latest LaTeX errors. to view the error message, you must click on the error in the log and & box; jump to the correct line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">When clicked on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window appears to select the template to be used for the document. the pre-set options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting a blank document, a document can either be rewritten from the ground or the wizard will be used for the quick creation of a new document. for more information, please refer to the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Frequent users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created in & Kile; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or a new file must be created. & Kile; can create a new template by drawing an existing document and selecting File Template from a document...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using File New, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set in Settings box... Settings General settings.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entering the document class. typically, it is used as following columns:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {items}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created this way, the following steps must be taken:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, your own template can then be selected instead of the standard ones.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files created. if an easy way to create a template is sought, one should search for one on the Internet and be executed under the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kile; used & Posters; as an internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the ability of reading and highlighting many different kinds of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for editors; can be made in the menu directly out & box;</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about and its possibilities, the manual about Kate should be consulted. users of & Kile; can start there directly by reading the chapter's work with the editor of & kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very practical & latex; command reference which can be called over the Menue LaTeX reference. it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be used in & latex, as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">A double click with added Ctrl button to select the & tex; this means that by clicking on\\ par of\\ par\\ bigware only\\ par is selected.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with pressed left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key, parts of the source text can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to browse and emphasize different kinds of source code. for example, the & latex; commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can add additional bounce marks. this is a separate type of bookmark within the text. the MenÃ ¼ te Edit bounce marks or the corresponding key handles allow the jump to the next or last jump. this jumping brand is also highlighted so that it is automatically deleted during the first entry of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The Edit is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like & Kile; though & kate; already excellent options were added in & Kile; important functions for writing a & latex; & latex; supports many environments and groups and therefore supports & Kile; special commands for their selection. under Edit Choices are the following commands for selecting text:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Select a complete paragraph (group of lines containing a blank line on both sides). this extended meaning includes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source text.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning, since this command also includes & latex; commands with a backlash line (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del key. & kate; offers the key menu Ctrl; K with which the whole line is removed. & Kile; offers with own commands for a faster possibility. under Edit Remove are the following commands to delete the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & box; is included in the description to Edit Excellent paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been made clear that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & Kile; for other commands under Edit surroundings for a possible simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command will jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command, jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is before or inside the\\ begin {environment} command, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested environmental commands, the overview can quickly be lost. this command closes the last opened environment so that the nested environment structure is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups that are determined by braces {...}. under Edit TeX group are some important commands that correspond to those from Edit surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command will jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command, jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the welded close-end bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is in front of or behind the welded bracket of a & tex; -group #, jump to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many nested spared groups parentheses can quickly get lost over the overview above. this command concludes the last group, so the nested structure of the & tex; groups will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple quotes are used as GÃ ¤nseschen. for the useful implementation is used in & Kile; the sign "for two simple quotes will be used. also for finishing the application the character is" used. & Kile; knows this case and for two closing quotes for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic entry of the double connection sign can be set up under Settings box... LaTeX will be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">It can also be used for translation specific settings (e.g. ngerman or French) and for German or French characters. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When shifting shift; enter & box; an intelligent line break. if the current position is within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & Kile; not only a line break, but also the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Within a table environment, t & box closes; the current line with\\\\ with an end line terminating.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & Kile; is smart enough to support preset & latex; - or user-defined environments. these can be added to the box Settings... LaTeX added.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange columns in tables environments and thereby assign all Et characters (amp;) among each other. & Kile; tries to replace this. when using Shift; Alt; amp; search & Kile; according to the next tab in the underlying line.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & kate; already offers a good source code completion, it was added in & Kile; for special commands (mostly for & latex;). three of them work on demand and the other two are for automatic completion. all these modes can be set for different ways of working under Settings box... Complete setup.</seg>
<seg id="1839">At the beginning a new environment using the command\\ begin {environment} will & box; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} after an empty line (for text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the back button, the last letter of the input is removed and, unfortunately, the completion list is missing. on the other hand, the list can also be reduced by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. the descriptions are naturally removed when selecting a command. alternatively, from & Kile, jump labels can also be filed, so that an easy jump to these positions is possible by editing bounce marks and the desired parameters can then be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Settings box; set up... Kile; complete settings can be made to these lists. you can select different counters for & tex; - and & latex; commands as well as general language needs.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not necessary for the completion of environments. there must always be a few letters with\\ begin and the call for completion mode will result in a large list of ambient commands. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & Kile; a special mode for the completion of the surroundings to be available.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When you call completion mode over the volume editing environment or the Shift key Alt + Shift key, the command to open the environment is automatically frozen and it will appear\\ begin {. afterwards, the environment completion can be continued in the simplest way and ending by pressing the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is done, the environment will be automatically closed again. once & box; realize that this is a list environment, even a first\\ item command will be added.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings box; set up... Kile; complete settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the list of complete functions for & tex; - and & latex; commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Kile; supports user-defined lists of abbreviations, which are immediately replaced by longer strings. the lists can be set up under Settings box... Kile Versions can be set up. as an example of a shutdown list, the file example.cwl, in which, for example, the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is entered, and the word completion mode is introduced over the volume editing or the Ctrl + Alt key, the character L is replaced by the character string\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large-size counters are not helpful for automatic completion. however, it has been found that many people in a document are written more than once. thus, & Kile; the completion for all already written words.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the menu box... Kile Versions are shutdown. here, the threshold value for displaying the completion can also be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1851">The complete directory files can be installed in the ~ / .kde / share / apps / box / complete / mode / the Persian home folder. mode stands for abbreviation (abbreviation), dictionary (WÃ ¶ rterbuch) or tex.</seg>
<seg id="1852">The Graphics dialog box shapes the inserting of graphics as easy as possible. for the overview of the basics on the graphics formats, the sections should be considered and observed.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as well-known as PDF files, but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages. if the PDF output is specified, the pages can be re-arranged with a few & PostScript; tools and then converted with ps2pdf to a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">In order to examine the results of the work, the source code needs to be compiled. all construction tools are grouped in the menu creation compile, create conversion and create view.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source code for viewers like & Okular; or the other conversion can be used the key-key Alt; 2. afterwards, the DVI-file can be viewed in the standard-time viewer by Alt; 4 via Alt; 4 the DVI; file converted into a PS file and be viewed by Alt; 5 the PS file.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the quick-build command, a viewer is usually called after compilation. if no built-in viewer is used, a new window will open each time.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project is about the project New Project.... This includes the following information for the project:</seg>

<seg id="1929">The plug-ins, the & quantaplus; grounded, have with & quantaplus; even possibly little to do. thus, the plug-in system will benefit immediately and do not have to wait until someone builds the shared in & quantaplus. the plug-ins can be used in a large number of & GUI; elements.</seg>
<seg id="1930">To install a plugin or a part, we will start with the Edit menu. this will open the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows to manage all of the plug-ins and add new ones. we describe each & GUI; element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plug-ins without a location, you can use this path to search the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often work on a project several individuals in a sort of hierarchical relationship to each other. & Quantaplus; supports the specification of team members and they can be configured using Shift; F7 project project properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the user's nickname and serves to uniquely identify.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have several roles in the project, such as team leaders as well as sub-project leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of team members who he is. this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the button Setze. the currently selected member (their identity) appears in bold after they are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nickname and setting your own identity are important in terms of news and notes. see for more information on annotations.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to an overview of their team, there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team: it can be created an event for information to the team leaders if something is happening. see for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something particular happens in the project. an example would be recording the opening and closing of the project, so that later can be seen how much someone worked on it, or sending a message when a file is saved, or a script that enters a file into CVS, as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the page event configuration of the Shift; F7 project Settings dialog, events can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email will be sent to the addressees selected in the recipient list. the addressee may be a team or sub-project leader.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Annotations are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by the following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">Enter notes is simple. it can either be selected from the note entry in the Editor context menu or the @ annotation keyword is entered in a comment area followed by note text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">In this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), where nickname is the default name of the team member, is a role in the project from the following possibilities: team Leader Subproject manager According to the area and sub-project leaders, the appropriate area or sub-project names should be given, as in the following examples below.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roles names are case-sensitive, but spaces around the parentheses and the names are invalid.</seg>
<seg id="1946">& quantaplus; is a development environment for scripting and formatting languages that is DTD agnostic and supports web-based formatting and scripting languages.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The settings are accessible via the Settings menu. here, only via & Quantaplus; -specific settings are handled, a short description for the others can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The settings can be set up by setting Quanta... to be called. this dialog extends over a number of pages that are treated consecutively.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behaviour of & quantaplus; concerning tags including car completion can be changed with that. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / lowercase of tags: large / lowercase of automatically inserted tags. normal bulk / lowercase means the tags are inserted in the same way they are described in tagging XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / lowercase of attributes: large / lowercase of automatically inserted attributes. normal bulk / lowercase means the attributes are inserted in the way they are described in the tagging XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically include: when checked, for tags, for which the closing tag is optional, this immediately after the & gt; inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Not include optional tags automatically: as above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Start and finish-day automatically update: if enabled, the corresponding final day will be amended and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic creation of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into the corresponding coding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for detecting various types of files. using button standard, the default settings can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the encoding of newly created or otherwise opened files (where the encoding of the file can be skipped). however, this setting here is executed by the same in the project features if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD has not been detected.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; builds regular backup copies so that during a power failure or crash at the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup. this is not the same as storing the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">Preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in your own view (or the documentation in a tab), making it possible to view the documentation, preview and source code at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree, representing the representation of the parser nodes in the document, can be set in details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the area of the mouse click on the structure tree the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the Structural Tree Configuration menu, the visibility of knots in the tree, the update frequency of the tree while editing, and how deep in modifying the structure tree will be opened automatically. empty nodes are empty spaces in the text, while empty groups are such in which no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Abbreviations are divided into groups, each can be valid for several & DTEP; s valid. this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the ifclause is slightly different than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Plugins are Kpart applications from third party, which can be re-used by any Kpart-capable application, the most well-known & konqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not located on a standard like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plugin when you start, so it can open the current file, the related folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">"" "load component in" "" "read-only" "" "mode: check if the plug-in refuses to load. only-Lese-KParts usually refuse to load if this option is not selected." ""</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if this is enabled, then test & quantaplus, if the input information is correct. select to save the entry, even if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & Quantaplus; from version 3.3, troubleshooting was completely redeveloped. the support for the non-needed built-in & PHP; (3) debugger was set, as well as support for the DBG debugger.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plugin is available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project starts with selecting a suitable debugger plug-in in the project settings. with the Options button next to the Debugger plug-in, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all holding points are listed, with time numbers and conditions. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as shown in HTML) of the debugger is shown.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to the debugger, if required, is made, or it tells the plugin to listen to debugger requirements. this action is triggered by default if a project is opened, which means a debugger, so that normally does not have to be taken care of.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debuggen's session starts the session. closes the connection to debugger or terminates listening to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a debug requirement. this is equivalent to using a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the Debugger output view.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and continuously send information about the monitored variables as well as the current line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution will be continued. if the script is started, the script starts with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens, while a script is stopped, the execution goes on. happens before a request is made, the execution starts as soon as a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger implements the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger implements the next instruction in the script, where possible in functions and include it is fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to pass the statement and go to the next one as if there were not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered, which should be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog, a variable can be entered or set a new value of a variable.</seg>

<seg id="1993">Document type Editing packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; used to provide support for brand and scripting languages as well as & CSS; their simplicity and flexibility makes from & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s exist in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages or & CSS;. & DTEP; s consist of two file types, the day folder and the toolbars. tag folders contain two file types, the descriptionrc; and TagXML files with the extension .tag. toolbars are handy, symbolic deserts of image buttons (above the editing window), which insert text and instructions faster into a document than a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see for details on conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are to be created, then the descriptionrc; and also toolbars. in short, one & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and contents of the properties dialog, the & pantaplus; for the day. the descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; self. toolbars enable quick insertion of tags into a document without the risk of a typing error.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folders. they contain only the descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folder carries the name of the description language and version, so available. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of TagXML and declares whether they are necessary or not. although not all of them are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have better insight and more information at work with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but it contains nothing but a type about itself otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when using & lt; attr &gt; an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid for class class only. the name of the base class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Valid only for the type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, tag has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other tag. (only family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a just element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes an attribute of a tag. this element can only occur once for each attribute. it specifies the name and type of attribute. in addition, there are other tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed & etc; This is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source code used to fill in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; used to reach the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus; used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, an interface and a method name. the arguments passed to the method. can be empty or% tag name%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A tag that assembles the elements of a list. it can only happen once for an attribute description. it is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specify the location of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specify the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog (e.g. for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined. this element is a just element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that end a day. this element is a just element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with a & XML; statement: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces do not affect anything, but watch & lt; signs. these should be replaced by & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt;. this will not cause a break, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is at the top of the & quantaplus; window to start and check tagging TagXML. a further dialog will appear, whose simple instructions will follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available yet. currently, verification is only performed when the TagXML files are loaded in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following one example for a family of 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the file name for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following one, an example of a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file a & PHP is described; the filename of this TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt; tags &gt; & lt; tag name = "overload" type = "function" &gt; & lt; attr name = "class _ name" type = "string" status = "optional" / &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The fildescriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor available for editing DTD's own DTD settings. with this, diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created for a newly created & DTEP; should be created a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] version = Version1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD specification. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with settings actions... to be created. click New Action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The button shortcut assigned to this action. by clicking on the user definition button, a shortcut symbol can be assigned; with K1 the current key shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the specified settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited), which change the document or use as input (or parts of the document), can be launched. examples from & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. To be found in the following places: $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variables that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we have replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current and quantaplus; if by & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text unique is added to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script input from & Quantaplus. in the selection box input can be determined what is to be sent to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">There are two types of output: normal output, written to the standard output; error messages, directed to the standard output. it can be specified, what should be done with the text written on the standard output, by setting the value the selection box output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group. in the given case, it is not too many, therefore you can create a toolbar with the name of the check.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you need to add and configure actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. pressing the New Action button at the bottom of the window will start editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Complete all required fields and add the tag to the right tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the tag has attributes and you are planning to use them, enable "Edit day" dialog if available so that you can enter the action when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this an ugly symbol? who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? do we replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action represents better, we will use & kiconedit; select from the & KMenu;, Graphics Other Programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, choose Editing size andern.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon will not only help you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With the view that the day starts, I decided to create a starting button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually interpreted as loose, starte, further interpreted), or at least, a message to the user will be signaled that clicking this symbol is a & lt; started; -tag in the current document will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it must still be connected to the action. this happens via the menu with settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. in addition to the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored icon is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the application button and continue with other tags, if there are any, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; functions to the toolbar or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview by some separators. open the toolbar setup dialog using settings toolbars. make sure the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">After selecting the element to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to have a quick way to access the Conqueror preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separator supports the grouping. someone who doesn't know my toolbar might think that the & konqueror; -Button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by absorbing all symbols to make sure everything is working.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Back up in the right folder. after new XML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the right folder.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language that you like best. that's why this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; repository whether someone has already done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to search for an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; -language. then you need to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for these documentations e.g. & PHP; 4.2 Documentation Section 1 = Section1.html Sec2.2 = Section1.html Sec2.2 = Section1.html Sec2.3 = Section1.html 21.1 = day 1.html tag2 = tag 2.html tag3 = day 3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see the & PHP; documentation such as:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html... Language Reference</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is a subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the box depth (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently on the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder will appear!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Space characters do not affect anything, but watch & lt; notes. these should be replaced by & lt; in all & XML; -based and quantaplus; Resourcendfiles be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file which serves to create context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; scripts would display the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separate context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc simply by $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local and global usage. then create a folder (as you specified it in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation to it.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation has been used to the & quantaplus; repository for use by the & quantaplus; community. you will not be rich, but proud to have collaborated with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the different resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The Resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or anyone else. in different places there is an email menu entry, such as DTD DTD packet (DTEP) send with email, send toolbar tool bar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all the others & quantaplus; users can download them. we recommend that the contributions are checked and only available if our team uses them as correct and useful for publication. in order to make a contribution, we recommend using a GPG / PGP key. this ensures the origin of the resources, both for our team and for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for your private GPG key after your passphrase (the passphrase is not saved), or in the case that you have several keys, you can select one. enter the input fields (URL preview can remain empty) and start clicking OK to start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP), toolbar toolbar, and started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, examine & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing. in case of problems, it warns and it can then be aborted. please read the warning messages carefully. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the specification of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages currently not yet by & Quantaplus. however, creation can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in XML format. there is the easier way to convert a DTD into a DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD Load and Converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD Description, which should be used. after that, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>

<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. to understand them and to get full benefit from and quantaplus, one must first familiarize themselves with these fundamental concepts.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus, the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available to anyone who uses & quantaplus; everything that is marked globally is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to secure different toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to anyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be anything from & CSS; patterns up to toolbars with special promotions especially for the files of a particular project. simply stated, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which emodes the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the tree view, the tabs with information and toolbars. please consult, and for further information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the tab on the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, such as close the current, other or all tab, reload, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS orders to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-clicking in the Editor area leads to a further context menu with respect to the processed document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / copy / paste), edit the tags under the mouse cursor, help the word under the mouse cursor, or open the file if the character string is called a file under the mouse cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editor window are the toolbars of the editor. currently & Quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard for which a set of toolbars is displayed. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a tag, e.g. & lt; paste; insert into your document, then click on the tag that represents the tag. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as armature), you can fill in a dialog several fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The tree views (QIT) make it possible to navigate in the information on & quantaplus; to navigate, open it and strip it. in the presentation with tabs are available for files, project, templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation tree views.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus. this view shows all the files in the project and allows administrators to manage the files in the project by right-click. actions like addition, removal, uploading or deletion of files from the storage media can be performed using the contextual menu that is then displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc; all possibilities are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used. global Templates are always available, local templates are only usable for the respective users and templates in projects are only usable in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripting languages. clicking with the left mouse button allows you to access the available information to a script. by clicking on the left mouse button, you can access the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, one shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right-clicking of an element, a list of commands opens in relation to the navigation and refresher of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other tree views. with it, it is possible to change attributes and namespaces. the entry system based on the content enables the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus. 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project, project-specific documentation can be added, edited and considered.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & Quantaplus; two tabs at the bottom of the window that can be accessed using useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab displays information about each script running in Quanta. thus, for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to the DTD are shown.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the markup of the current document. & Quantaplus; scripts that are executed give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbars are extensively expanded and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the toolbars is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with email. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as compressed Tar archive by & kmail;. if they receive a toolbar in an email, they can secure and load them in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the configure script. autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems with starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that there is no older version of & kde; 3 in PATH in front of her bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML; editor, the developers of & quantaplus started to deal with a obvious idea: what if & quantaplus; an independent, expandable markup language editor? well, this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer on pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then should & quantaplus; for this the suitable & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be noted that & quantaplus. as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & node; developer community based. & quantaplus; follows, in good application of free software, the idea of Why develop what someone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; framework is not only this all possible but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">With self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation can dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation can be increased almost every task.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>

<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, but the oldest entry is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. look into the section on templates. if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">When inserting from the clipboard, converts special characters to & HTML, so that they are displayed correctly and are not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instruction.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from clipboard in & URL; -loop which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. primarily used to insert & URL; s in anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection to or off. this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the & Shift; select the key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful when your & PHP; script outputs error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind of grep or sed with GUI and pre-defined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window in which you see the display of script actions and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Extension of the delimporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as you change to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with entries Previous or Next, depending on the position of the cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped according to the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard disk. & quantaplus; projects are saved with file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this allows for example to copy graphics files into your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project on the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and whether you have downloaded further input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus; the project is managed. in chapter & quantaplus, you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Load a project toolbar. these are stored in project / toolbars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbars. allows you to select the type of toolbar: locally or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Open a dialog to add a new toolbar. it just creates the name. actions must be set by means of actions... to be added. toolbars will be saved using toolbars toolbars, or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. it doesn't delete it from the disk. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you'll be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team so that the toolbar is available in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows the uploading of toolbars to the main server, where everyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Loading a & DTD; you or anyone else made and convert to & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Loading / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP should be freshened without renewing the entire & DTEP; if this is global and a write permission in the global KDE folder is not available, the load fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded toolbars. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a submenu standard in the Tags menu, which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current Day Settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates and deactivates the smart insertion of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent inserting means that & quantaplus. pasting by means of toolbar if this tag contradicts the rules at this place.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plugins are listed under the menu items above. click on them. click on an activated plugin to deactivate it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on the type; version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Select the type of line-ending identifier. very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms for development. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate change between the different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching may sometimes need time or create beautiful graphics. recommended is the flashcard mode, which is also the default setting, or the sub-window mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for each open sub-window. selecting an entry will activate the corresponding subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Activates the status bar display at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog affect any application using the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Specify the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of posters; see details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you delete entries from the toolbars, or which can add and change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help in accordance with the environment of the mouse pointer, but is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& Quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find here the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be filled up from top to bottom, because, for example, the entire directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically after filling out the project name. all these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift; F7 project project features.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name, file is filled in automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase letters and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access, unless you edit local data. either a name (hostname.g..de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol will be used. depending on the setting of the remote host an adjustment might be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder in which the templates for the project are stored. it is a relative path to the project and default templates. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where toolbars are saved for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to include files from the local filesystem into the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. for server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Let it be checked if files located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included. if a project is started from scratch, not hooks.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an exact selection according to your own discretion.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the root folder. you can select the desired files by hook or, by removing the tick, clips from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the subwindow profile or Shift; F7 can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (placeholders are possible), which are ignored for project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, including files listed in .cvSignore, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This means that the desired debugger can be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the debugger plugin can be set using the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Upload Profiles can be used to set high-load profiles (see in), as well as the display of a tree view for each profile's content by contacting one's own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the sub-window team configuration project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow, you can turn off event actions and add, modify or delete events. event actions are executed when a previously determined event occurs, such as securing a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, I open & quantaplus; the last project that was opened. this behavior can not currently be influenced.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select project open... from the menu project or the icon project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & Quantaplus; closed, the project file is automatically saved. you'll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project tree view gives free access to the files in the project. there the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave as well, but the entries are missing opening and opening with... in the context menu available with the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows you to remove the current profile. if only one profile exists, the button is dazzled to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten in the end of the program. this option is useful when frequent upload of files is necessary and the rather unreliable password on the disk drive option is not in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the commit or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many high-load profiles can be created and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to which the files should be copied. either a full-qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slave. at least, you should choose from & FTP;, file (locally) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally, this does not need to be changed, except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it after your discretion. the password is hidden on the disk, so it is not easy to read, but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only a set of files and toolbars. there can be many views in a project, i.e. by simply swapping the view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved, opened or deleted from the Project or Project Toolbar menu, accessible via settings toolbar project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has the most to do. this not only helps increase productivity, but also allows adaptation of & quantaplus; to its own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, toolbars in & quantaplus are best controlled using the toolbar menu. use and Add differ. adding toolbars will be processed at the bottom of the Add tool bar section.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and symbols on it can either be set using context menu (right-click on toolbar), in which a new toolbar can be created, other actions like toolbars can be removed, toolbars can be rename or toolbars run, which can be specified, what actions should be visible on these or other toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, the entries will be removed and action edited, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings toolbars... and set settings actions.. set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are basically document skeletons, code cutlets and files to connect. & quantaplus; used templates basically like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or link any directory existing to the system in the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus. templates have in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & Quantaplus; supplied templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions mentioned at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary models are usually inserted in documents via links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be written from any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. typically, more special documents are placed in corresponding subfolders. you can easily scaffold for the purpose and organize the work in an appropriate way to be efficient. some examples can be found in template tree under global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of template is useful if not a new document based on a template, but the same text area should always be inserted in the documents. you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis. some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for whole websites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently, there are no examples in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure as you like (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and select File As Template As a local template...</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this is done, note that (even if it is stored as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look in the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As Template save option as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be simply dragged with drag and drop on the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary packages is simple: copy the file into a template folder. all file management functions can be used for it, such as dragging and dropping or pasting through the Konqueror file tree.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder right in the file tree or in the project file tree view and create a site template, enter a name for the template, and secure it. by default, it is saved in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very goal-oriented approach. you can pretend headlines and footers or dynamically add & PHP; design, paste or associate files with them. in addition, you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files laid in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates. each folder corresponds to one of four types of containers as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder, right-click on the folder and select properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three types previously described; files, text or templates.</seg>
<seg id="2212">If a root folder is set, it would generally disable templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows previous or custom text for templates in this folder. this could be general headers or footers for all templates for a particular project and allows to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate headers / footers by copying content templates to a folder with special headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (show right mouse button) over a complete command file to add folders or copy and paste templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& Quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & sourcecode editor which can be reached via the View menu. the first mode replaces the source text editor by the VPL; editor and the second divides the editor window into two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor. then you can edit and then switch back to source code editor where the changes made in the VPL; editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor in a document containing & PHP; a small green symbol indicates the absence of PHP; -Source. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; to edit, still the source editor is necessary. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first one except that the changes are visible both in the source editor and in the VPL; editor is synchronous in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor. with F9, this mode is active, the keystroke allows the active cursor from one window to another, maintaining the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; editor and the source code editor can be set via Settings Quanta. when selecting VPL, you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation is: a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so tools to choose document properties. thus editing of invisible tags in working with the VPL; editor is also called when a new document with the VPL; editor is created. this will help reduce the manual coding. this can change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click on the list allows changing the contents, e.g. keywords in the column names and keyword key word2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list. a change over the list is just as possible with the meta elements. editing of CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS styling template by pressing the file open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursor is possible, as in word processing, by moving with the arrows. under rare circumstances the cursor behaves as usual. the text can be inserted as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deleted using the back button or removed button.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags will be done in the same way across the toolbars, as in the source code editor. it should be noted that inserting tags previously existing identical tags will not be removed, e.g. if an anchor tag, surrounded with text, must be removed any other surrounding anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars like the table assistant or the Listen directive are disabled. they will work later in & VPL; in this release the tables or lists toolbars must be used.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for examining style sheets. unlike other style templates, search for specific elements is possible and the style template can be traced.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain briefly why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated, because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts when merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed only the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it into the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparison and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a fully-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two people work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps & kdiff3; in this editor you can even edit the result directly. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screen shot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; when merging the folder:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and resists the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently need to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabulators are displayed visibly. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side. (no more annoyance if someone changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other differs in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name but are in different folders, you can make typing errors easier by just writing the file name of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 Folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 -o destination folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">Open dialog allows manual typing of file names, selecting from the file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. the opening dialog notes your selection and shows it next time. you don't need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of the differences is done with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Using the Folder button... you can also select a folder. if you choose a folder, the merge or merge of folders is initiated. if a file is selected for A, but a folder, then use & kdiff3; the filename from A to the other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When interacting is enabled, the input field is active for the target and can be edited. however, it is not necessarily necessary to set an output file immediately. you can do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The set-up button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before you start comparing / merging.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag & drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">If you want to figure out how similar these functions are, it would be a fairly large effort. you only need to create two corresponding files, load them in & kdiff3; and then compare them. now you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you cannot extract it from & kdiff3; only dropping text into a comparison window will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the dragging and dropping text into another program as cutting and inserting (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Windows C is optional.) Every information line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest for a while over the line.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these default settings can be changed using the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, you can see in the color which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files.</seg>
<seg id="2306">When differences are found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (in C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no rows. if the line breaks is enabled, the line will be dashed to the broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (under the comparison windows) also has an info line with the wording output:, the filename and [Changes] when you edited the result. usually, it contains already text by automatic merging, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, the Save is grayed out!!! (use the sprinklink sprinkler in the next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, every difference at the same time is also a conflict that needs to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows, the group belonging to the row will be selected in all windows and the first row of the group will be displayed. (this will also highlight a jump in the position in the windows where the group's beginning would otherwise not be visible.) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for the current area and on the left appears a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes by automatic merging or manually editing, no more line is left in the group; then in these lines the text & lt; No row in the file; displayed. this is only a place holder for the case that you change your mind and maybe yet another source. this text does not appear in the final saved file, nor in a marker that you may copy and insert elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merging conflicts; however, appears in the clipboard when you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if selecting the sources ignores the options numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments enabled, changes in numbers or comments will also be treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigates mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, side up, side down, end, end, strings start and string end, as you can also use it from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the Auditions window, you can also use the other buttons for editing. with the insertion button, you can change between insert and overwrite mode. (default is insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the compilation and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous difference (Ctrl / Ctrl image) or to the next / previous conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the clipboard to the clipboard, you must copy the copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl Insert). if this is enabled, whatever you mark is automatically copied to the clipboard and the manual copying is omitted.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored according to the underlying OS. Unix versions use a line feed character\, and Win32-based systems use cart regression + line feed\\ r\. Kdiff3 does not keep the line ends of the source files, so you should use & kdiff3; also not using binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of recently used files will be saved automatically during the ending and restored at the next start. (menu settings - &gt; Kdiff3 set up...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also provides variable width fonts, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences are displayed in italics. if the selected script does not support this display, nothing happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors may not be available in their pure form, but would be modeled.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is enabled, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when the tabulator key is pressed. otherwise, a tab character will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press input or return, the indentation of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is enabled, each selection will be automatically copied to the clipboard. the manual copying to the clipboard is then omitted.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line-end type you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files try & kdiff3; first to find all identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. in this step white characters are ignored. in this step white characters are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a carriage return character '\\ r' and a newline '\' at the end of a line, others save only one newline '\'. usually, the carriage returns are made visible, but then they might be treated like a white character.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is deactivated. in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensely search for even smaller differences. the option is enabled in default. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slow on very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the Automatically advanced mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next unresolved conflict will be injected.</seg>
<seg id="2335">This is useful when white characters are less important in many files. if you only need this from time to time, then use better the functions Select A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the Automatic Selection also affects numbers or comments when the options are ignoring numbers or ignoring C / C + + comments enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are dealt with in chapter to scan folders and perform merging. see for details in documentation about the comparison and merging.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already an older version exists, then the original version is appended to the suffix .orig. if such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adjust the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the currently running program. you need to quit and restart, so that the change becomes active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally across the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the upper setting will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Over the selection fields for coding a short notice appears what the local coding is. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted. as the coding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different encoding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding should be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define preprocessor commands, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files could be 16-bit Unicode, but the preprocessor command can only handle 8-bit ASCII).</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn off this to suppress changes in white characters in text or review columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignoring numbers or ignoring C / C + + comments enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are shown in a color coded oversight column. but sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply select the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you look at the differences and then decide to merge the files. merging the current file in the merge menu will also work if you only compare two files. (if this function is used to restart the merge operation, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. in & kdiff3, then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that fits exactly your needs. you can use this feature, for example, to cut out disturbing parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When a file is read, it is passed to this external command first. if a normal preprocessor command is also specified (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this preprocessor command. you can write your own preprocessor that fits exactly your needs. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users don't want to program it by themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl completely suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2352">\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2353">The\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you are experimenting with sed, you might start to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignoring of numbers is actually an already built-in function in Kdiff3. but it is good as an example for another pre-processing command for line deviations. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and every hit is replaced by nothing, so virtually deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you may want to perform several substitutions at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the substitutions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something else like perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replacement / SCHALTER 'However some details are different from perl. where used\\ (and\\) is needed perl only needs (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor are retained for display and merging. the other operations only change the data that the newline algorithm looks like.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when using a normal preprocessor, the newline processor sees the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare & merge with & kdiff3; complete folders recursively and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for each object to merge; you can adjust the proposal before starting,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and show the simulated changes without actually performing them,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging single files. you just need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog File.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as a base. if no destination folder is specified, use & kdiff3; folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, not the merge. to start the merge, you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (see more details.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, you will be informed of a little news window about the current progress. if you cancel the scan of the folders, only the files that were compared until then will be listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When the scan of the folder is complete, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is normally folded up. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - or double-clicking on the object or by using the arrow keys for left / right.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double-click on a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, this is visible in the A / B / C columns and the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action cannot be automatically selected. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed about problems of this kind again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the picture above, colours red, green, yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns.</seg>
<seg id="2376">With identical entries, however, the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if their entire contents are identical. then, folders also have the same color. in folders, age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea to this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green then yellow and later when it is old, red becomes.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>

<seg id="2387">When merging, one file is executed after the other. the status column displays finished when the merge is successful, and correspondingly different messages when something unexpected occurred. if the merge is complete, you should make a final check and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full Analysis, Kdiff3 will display more columns. these contain the number of unsolved, resolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at one time. if you have selected all the merge actions (also in all subfolders), you can start the merge operation.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have no destination folder, then in the Three-Folder-Merge mode C is used as the destination, in the two-folder merge, B is chosen as the target and when syncing, A and / or B will be used as a target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check if all entries should be in the destination folder, also in the folder structure. there are some options that may be skipped by certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory merge / continue in the list menu, or press F7 (the key shortcut). to merge only the current element: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If conflicting file types still exist invalid merge actions, a message appears which indicates incorrect elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog box appears with the options Browse, Simulate and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making any changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then perform certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file) then a merge window opens (note the screen shot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are finished with a file, select / continue directory merge again, or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, a corresponding dialog appears. then proceed & kdiff3; its work continues with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If you encounter a mistake, a message and detailed status information appears. at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you select the cause of the problem. if you continue merging (F7 key), you will have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in a different way before proceeding.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, notice & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and do not merge them together later. even if the merge operation has been skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered complete. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Set Settings - &gt; Kdiff3...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files matching the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. separate the pattern with a semicolon;. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be typed more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be typed more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autmatically generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder-specific file can be set with a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some filesystems, files have a hiding attribute. in other filesystems, a previous point is selected as hidden. this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">If the option is switched on, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files are compared to which the links are shown. this is deactivated by default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">If the option is turned on, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the links like normal folders will be treated and recursively searched. (note that & kdiff3) will not be checked for possible recursions.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistic columns. (the number of dissolved, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files containing no text. (enter an appropriate anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders using a slow network, it may be quicker to compare only the change date and file size. however, this speed advantage costs you a certain level of security. please use caution. this option is switched off by default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to Confidential the Date of Change. there is no real comparison. the files are considered identical if they are equal. this can be useful, for example, when copying the change date. please use caution. this option is switched off by default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Enable the synchronize mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected in such a way that afterwards both folders are identical. the results of merging files are stored in both folders.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging the newer file is suggested as an action. (this is considered insecure because the knowledge assumes that the other file has not been modified too. you should check this in any case.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, the original version will be renamed and the extension .orig. When an old backup file with the .orig extension already exists, it will be deleted without further backup. this also applies to normal merging of individual files, not only the merging of entire folders. this option is enabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the merge-merge view remains visible to merge individual files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want it, you can switch the main window in the pop-up menu and switch between the two views by changing between directory & text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You probably prefer to compare a file by double-clicking. however, there is a corresponding menu entry in the directory menu. you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge. once you save the result, the status will be reset and the file will not merge again if you start the folder merge.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost when you re-read the directory: directory menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDE uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open files located on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file to an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. you should note a few things:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. contain. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, blank &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file with the name / # foo # contains the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes because of the filesystem on the server, sometimes through the protocol used. there is a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows. then a file is always assumed as a link destination. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or modification date. therefore, the permissions or the modification date deviate from the original. (note the confidentiality of the size.) (This is only possible for local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is currently the difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP first always starts the built-in difference viewer. to start Kdiff3, press the right mouse button over the difference viewer and then select In Kdiff3Part from the contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Usually needed & kdiff3; two complete input files. if it is used as a Kpart, it accepts & kdiff3; the name of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then & kdiff3; the patch program will start to recover the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror, you can click on a patch file and select Preview in - Kdiff3Part from the Preview menu. please note that this does not work if there is no original file. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the creation of the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kdiff3; runs as part, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in the Kpart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and Kdiff2 (now there are compact) exist already. in addition, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can merge like the program diff3 from the Diff Tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs very long and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or are going to go that way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from the sources and probably didn't tell the configure script to KDE. in default configure installed in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated as identical; however, if only a non-white character is different, the line is treated as not identical. if similar lines appear next to each other, this is is often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. however, this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C. this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this has been too big so far. you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger quantities of text another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; No src has been left; no src has been released; and the text cannot be deleted. what does that mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses already many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and misuse the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information about how to use Kdiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">You can find a list of the latest changes at http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the ChangeLog file in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the & kdiff3; distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir returns the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">As & kdiff3; autoconf and automake used, you should not have problems with compiling. if you still encounter difficulties, please write to the & kde; -Mailinglists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift-Remove) copy to the clipboard and delete the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift-Insert) inserts the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position and replaces the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only show differences: files identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you need to re-read the folder with the update after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">This also means that identical files will not be copied to the target folder when merging. if the destination folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after the merge operation. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines are attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the lines are already present, they will be removed when you click the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; displays a miniature preview of all virtual workspaces. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the working surfaces, change their size, finish them or move them.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual workspaces as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; the movement is possible both inside a working area and on other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: when clicked on the empty Background of & Kpager; clicked, the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries Minimize, Maximize, On Desktop and Beam. the commands do the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected Virtual Desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows can be moved within the & Kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also moved to other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">If this field is enabled, in & Kpager; the names of the virtual workspaces are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field lets the & Kpager; display the numbers of virtual workspaces. if it is enabled along with name, the names are provided with ordinal numbers, eg. 1. desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is enabled, the background of each desktop is also displayed as a background in the & Kpager; displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is enabled, the running programs will be displayed as small windows in the & Kpager; otherwise, only the empty working areas will be displayed to enable their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simple shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the windows with their default icon and Pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is recommended for very fast systems only.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the main window can be determined: classically lets & Kpager; in a 2xN grid, like from pager applications in some other Windows managers, horizontally displays all virtual workspaces in a horizontal and vertical row, which is very good for displaying laterally on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, display and move the windows as symbols or with its contents. besides, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right click within & pager; and then set up switch settings... let the dialog appear settings.</seg>
<seg id="2465">At the moment it is not possible to change the settings in the dialog. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you do not have write permission for the file, you must log in as user root or turn to your system administrator.</seg>
<seg id="2467">Since & Kpager; part of the kdebase package, you will need a functioning installation of the KDE basic packages.</seg>

<seg id="2481">& Kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended with new features. it is optimized for use on powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="2482">When you start & Kmag, a window appears as shown above. the main window of & Kmag; displays the enlarged area of the screen. in the following, this window is referred to as magnifying window.. the image shown in the magnifying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">The default setting is enlarged & Kmag; the area around the mouse cursor is like a moveable magnifier. alternatively, you may select a selected screen area in the magnifying window (select window mode) or the surroundings of the mouse pointer at the edge of the screen (eg; on the left edge of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid the mouse cursor being displayed in the enlarged window, select the mouse cursor setting. please note that the mouse pointer is still not able to detect the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the default node; / Qt; mouse cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the drop-down mode, you can adjust the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointer in the magnifying window and hold the left mouse button, so you can capture and move the contents of the magnifying window. this also works with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"" "if you press the" "" "Shift" "" "button or press the & MMB; you can move the selection window." ""</seg>
<seg id="2488">With this combination you can change the size of the selection window. note that the top left corner of the selection window remains fixed and only the bottom right corner is to move.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& Kmag; has a lot of functions. you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer, save it to a file, copy it to the clipboard (to insert it later into other applications), rotate the picture and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Start or stop the ad update. stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go to 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the update rate (very low, Gering, Medium, High, Very High). the higher the update rate, the more CPU time is needed.</seg>

<seg id="2499">And kmousetool; can bypass the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helping so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, pain may also be caused by the use of your computer. if you suffer from pain associated with your computer, you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear again: even though & kmousetool, avoid pain caused by moving the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic aids, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>

<seg id="2506">If the sound appears delayed, you can reduce the response time. to do so, go to the & kcontrolcenter; go to Sound & Multimedia, choose Sound System, and here the Rider General. there is a slider called Sound Buffers, which you set to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool; start & kmousetool; this function is currently only available at & kde; for GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically.</seg>

<seg id="2509">The best use & kmousetool; first with the default settings. in particular, the smart move should be turned off first. if you then get used to the automatic mouse click, you can later accept the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response time of & kde; for sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of which places a click of a mouse remains without effect: clicking on the neutral parts of windows or in the browser window that does not display a link does not result in unwanted reactions. you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse clicks, you should clean your mouse. it's usually pretty simple. the trick is that you don't just clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to take out the mouse ball. as this happens, mouse to mouse is different, but it should be clear if you take a look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. you can scrape the dirt and dirt with a flat blade or finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts execution of & kmousetool; if you are using the smart move, that means that & kmousetool; the operation no longer can end by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can execute a mouse click. this will reset the status of & kmousetool; you can continue to work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you type text, try & cmousetool; continue to execute the mouse clicks and set the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to where you want it. however, you can use the mouse on a neutral zone of the desktop if you want to have a keyboard input.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with smart moving, but I don't manage to edit lyrics.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart shift is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes time before you can handle it. it is very likely possible in this way to copy text, copy it to the clipboard, or execute any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move if you just begin to use it & cmousetool; instead, select a mouseclick at one end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and hold the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. as a result, when & kmousetool, the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when the shifting time starts with smart moving. later you can use the smart move even without the audible mouse click. however, it requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">In order to be able to use the XTest-extension for & X Window; this should be the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and loudspeaker, and these are properly set up.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced features of & ktts; filters are not required for normal work.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In filters, text is processed before being sent to the speech-speech-dispenser. they are useful for improving pronunciation, to substitute false spoken words or abbreviations, select a suitable language and speaker or to circumvent certain shortcomings of speech synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the way filters work, it is important to know how the "speech-dispenser" program works with a text. & quot; distinguishes four types of text.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops these jobs. once the output of the screen reader is read, the pending jobs will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important messages such as & eg; processor is reserved to hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after the issue of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Messages have the next highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you are reading a long text on a web page, you can chat with & kmouth; messages are also messages.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. every order you tap from the card card is a text order. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text orders. text orders are meant for the output of longer texts, which have no particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queues except Screen Readers output. when an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktats; just one such reading, this output is stopped and terminated.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters process the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future, there can still be more types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Replacing parts of a text with other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & quot; is supplied with predefined string replacement filters, which allow the creation of chat-emoticons such as: -) by text or for reformatting messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable way.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; converters use a XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert XML; from one format to another format. in the scope of delivery of & ktts; some XSLT files are included in the translation of & XHTML; in SSml.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With subscriber selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or the program that has sent the text to & ktts; sent to a speaker. for example, if you have inserted a female voice on the map sheet speaker, you can read the text of KDE messages about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has adjustable rules, after which it is applied for a voice output. if the filter determines that its rules do not apply, the text remains unchanged to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; notification is sent, it is processed by all activated filters installed on the bottom of the page. processing by the filters takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of the established normal filters. if a filter is not selected, it is not checked and is not used.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter, and the further below setup dialogs are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2638">You must enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern to set up a string assertion filter. if these patterns are found in the text, the text will be replaced with the corresponding replacement text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name as you like, it only has to differ from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string from the Erset column. the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the marked word or the regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. load a list from a file, the entries from the file are attached to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter is applied only if the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here. click on the button to display a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages if you press the & Ctrl; button at the click of the button.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter is applied only if the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter multiple programs separated by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID of running programs is provided with the program qdbus;. the & dbus; numbers must be omitted. if for example & qdbus; the application ID copied-3432, you may only enter copied.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string assertion filter is applied to the text only if all the conditions correspond to an entry in the box Diesen filter if all the input fields are empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">In comparison of words, the string replace filter uses regular expressions in the\\ s word\\ s. so, the words must be limited on both sides by separators (spaces).</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions. but if you have installed the & # 160; for & # 160; for & # 160; for & # 160; for & # 160; for & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; Expressions can be found in the package kambiguels.</seg>

<seg id="2650">Enter the path for the program xsltproc. if xsltproc is accessible via the PATH environment variable, xsltproc is also sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the speaker chooser filter, you can send text to a particular speaker set up on the card's card speaker or to a speaker with certain properties. for example, you can set the texts by kmail to be read by a female voice.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before writing a text to the filter, it is looking for a speaker for the text. the speaker is selected based on the speaker characteristics that the program performs, which sends the text to & ktts; sends, and the characteristics of the speakers appointed on the map board.</seg>
<seg id="2653">If a value is entered here, the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression. if on your system of the & node; editor & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; Expressions, you can call it by clicking on the button to get help in the input.</seg>
<seg id="2654">To achieve faster processing, you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Specify the characteristics of the speaker you are looking for. if the text meets the filter conditions shown above, the speaker will be selected to meet the desired requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to save or load your speech settings, or to delete all settings.</seg>

<seg id="2667">Due to an error in festival 1.95 beta you need to install the (male British) voice rab _ diphone to enable Sable to work at all. you must do this yourself if you do not use this voice for reading web pages. also, make sure that the program xsltproc is installed and can be found via the PATH environment variable.</seg>
<seg id="2668">Certain characters or punctuation marks seem to cause errors when synthesizers, so that whole sentences are skipped or only gibberish is issued. what can I do about it?</seg>
<seg id="2669">First, make sure that the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language. if there are problems with certain characters or words, these may be fixed by a string assertion filter.</seg>

<seg id="2688">With these slider controls, you set the volume, speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you cannot select some controllers and display this grey, the voice you select does not allow these settings.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like MultiSyn voices require several seconds to be loaded because of their size. if you mark this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD so that (with larger memory consumption) the first set will be synthesized faster.</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not set up a speaker (or click Apply.).</seg>

<seg id="2706">Messages have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that speaks messages. if you are looking for a long text on a website, you can get with & kmouth; nevertheless someone who just enters the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text message is interrupted by a message, warning or the output of a screen reader, add & ktts; the audio output in the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted. if both the introductory sound and the introductory message are active, the introductory sound will be played before the incoming message.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSml) is a W3C standard to mark text for voice output. this standard contains trademarks for controlling voices, speaking speed, volume, sex of voice and pitch.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently support & tts; SSml only partially and only in basic functions. the following limitations are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You have to install the rab _ diphone (British) voice, since this is the default voice, the festival is used at the SSml edition.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If settings for speed or sound are not set to 100% in the Festival configuration dialog, SSml text is usually spoken very monotonously.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and propositional filter filters (SDB filter). SBDs divide text into individual phrases. this way you can start with the preview, since only the first set has to be synthesized, not the whole text order.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the set-limit recognition filter. at the first start of the set, a set limit recognition filter is set up automatically. you can change its settings or add additional set-limit recognition filters, but beginners will be discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to do this is to try setting up the speaker selection by trying. switch off the speaker selection and enter text to read. switch off the speaker selection, change some properties and check how the speaker's selection changes. of course, you have to have more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then you can start reading faster, since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole block of text, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">If the voice synthesizer doesn't support this feature, you can set up text orders on the card file.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set-limit recognition filter is automatically set up when you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, only removed. do not change anything in this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Punctuation filters match text with a regular expression for punctuation and add a tabulator sign (decimal code 8) at the set limits. note that the standard set-limit recognition filter retains the character set.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; messages (knotify), warnings, messages or the output of screen reactors.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal set-limit identifier, you can insert it again by loading the file standard _ sbdrc contained in & ktts;</seg>
<seg id="2736">"" "you can override the" "" "Speaker settings" "" "for the application on the" "" "Speakers" "" "menu." ""</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the default speaker (the top one on the card card speaker). in other words, no speaking properties are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Using the most appropriate speaker that has all the features of a set-up speaker. if you do not delete or edit the speaker's settings, choose this speaker. otherwise, select your speaker. otherwise, select the speaker closest to the originally set properties.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired speech properties by clicking on one of the buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the speaker you want. if this feature doesn't matter, do not enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Select this check box if the property should have priority over other properties. you can also set several markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output, it is always treated as a primary feature. you will rarely use this feature. the only case you may want to specify the attribute language is before, if you know that a particular application sends text in another language than that set in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the features in the speaker area, which is most likely to delete the following, click the default speaker to use and then use the speaker, which is closest to the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 for the last text order is in the queue. you can also specify an order number. (without the order number, enter 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr crashes when it is started. I've compiled debug support, but I don't get any tracing.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer 0.8.x is the most common version of GStreamer. if the problem is not resolved, it may be a non-compatible version of GStreamer. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output of ALSA does not work if I play music at the same time with another application. if I stop a text order, freezes & ktops; a message that says: Unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system there is the problem that conflicts occur with ALSA, which prevent the simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. information for possible solutions can be found on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the internet. I installed them and can use them in festival, but kttsmgr doesn't show this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add the new voice to the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / festivalint / vocal. as a guide you can serve the other entries. if that is successful, please send a patch along with the & URL, where you have found the voice to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In order for this to work, the program must be installed sox and be discoverable via the PATH environment variable. some synthesize modules such as Festival Interactive also offer a setting for speed on the map for speaking devices. depending on the selected voice, this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the speech speed are ignored when & ktats; & HTML; reads. (this is because the HTML is converted to SSml.) Deactivate either the filter for the conversion of & HTML; by & XML; (see) or, if you are completely courageous, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after-SSml forming filter, and set up the speech speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't make it that websites are read with a female voice. I have set up a female festival speaker, but & ktats; read the websites with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At festival 1.95 beta, the day Sable GENDER does not seem to work. the xsl file rejects the GENDER Tags for converting SSml to Saber. the same also applies to the VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added a custom string assertion filter and now I can go back or forth; no more pre- or return. on the Karteireiter job is shown, the job consists only of one set. what do I do wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">You may not filter interpolation marks (dot, question mark, exclamation mark, comma and semicolone). instead, use a filter for set-limit detection for these characters.</seg>
<seg id="2757">ALSA (Advanced & Linux; Sound Architecture). ALSA is installed on most systems with & Linux; already installed. (www.alsa-project.org)</seg>
<seg id="2758">GStreamer in version 0.8.7 or later. note: make sure that the GStreamer modules are registered by calling the Streamer (HTTP: / / gstreamer.freedestop.org) command before using GStreamer. (HTTP: / / gstreamer.freedesktop.org)</seg>
<seg id="2759">Some users experience in connection with ALSA conflict in the audio output. if your system also counts, you can't play music at the same time and read a text. & quot; freezes if you hold a text order and then launch another. possible solutions for this problem can be found on the ALSA website (dmix).</seg>
<seg id="2760">As of July 2005, aKode does not support any real breaks. if you hold a text order in & ktts, the current set will be read yet.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The audio program sox is used for general utterance adjustment, but is not necessarily required. Debian users can install sox using the apt-get install sox command.</seg>
<seg id="2762">If you have downloaded tarball (with tar packed archive), login as a normal user and unpack the tarball into a suitable folder. change to this folder and enter the following commands:</seg>

<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to choose which is best suited to distribution and releasestand. by marking the setting Not-again, the definition can be taken permanently. at the next start of the network settings, this selection will be set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. before, all options are displayed gray, which means the settings can only be viewed, the change is not possible.</seg>

<seg id="2808">The Network Interface Panel is used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be performed by the Rider Network Interface:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings of the network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface... set up in the dialog device.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the automatic selection, TCP / IP settings are taken from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings for the system are also made with the start of the system services. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all required TCP / IP information at each system start, so no further setting is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP, according to the system, can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection Manual, the TCP / IP configuration can be made without DHCP or BOOTP. in the IP address field, the desired TCP / IP address must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface when booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & konsole, you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in case of doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off as required. switching on a switched-off network device is enabled by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface.</seg>

<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the appropriate IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the host calls http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS will resolve this name to an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution part of the name resolution part of the name resolution makes it easy to manage this list. entries can be added, removed or changed. DNS records can be sorted by selecting an entry and / or downgrading in the list with the button Hinder or Herunder.</seg>

<seg id="2833">For installing the binary distributions (usually rpm packages), it is sufficient if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the ready-compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a graphical interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of your distribution can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; but in addition, the development packages are needed with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only by experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile and compile; the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology will be given, and in the second section all of the configuration files will be discussed by & knetworkconf.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about the integration of the PC is conveyed into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently run with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found widespread dissemination. IPv6 is expected to be implemented in the near future. therefore, this description is currently focusing on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is to be assigned. in foreign networks, at & eg; workstation, the network administrator can use a valid IP address or, if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address can not be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up an own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from an area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, therefore its use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, the access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateway.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are mostly used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = your own computer). the default route is required for the IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to its own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">This section contains the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf and where they are stored in the distributions.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar. it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar, which moreover offered the ability of dds2tar to fast, selective unpacking.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used it must be involved by & dat; it can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& dat; clears the tape and reads the pre-tensioning information of the tape. detects and kdat; if you don't know the preload on the tape, you will be asked if the tape should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">If this is not found, you will be asked if the band index should be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything goes smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive will change to indicate that the tape has been incorporated. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched by flaps of the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the tape, the integration must first be resolved. there are three methods to achieve this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; indicated by modifying the symbol for the tape, that the integration for the tape has been resolved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the tape can now be ejected without any danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape of & dat can be used, it must be formatted by & dat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band type must be formatted before you can use it to store data. this process does not correspond to formatting by & kdat;. does your tape drive require formatting before use. floppy tape drives usually require formatting the tape, while DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and capacity, the tape continues and the tape is formatted. all data on the tape is lost! after the formatting process is finished, the tape is automatically integrated and ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you initiate the backup process, you must select the files to be secured. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a safety profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are secured.</seg>

<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the dialog box appears. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. only the selected file or folder will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a check. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>

<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to recreate the tape indexfile based on the band content. this process clears all existing index files for this tape. you can reconstruct the index in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current work folder where the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected work folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all the files listed in backup files, only the files in it are backed up on the same filesystem, such as the folder. folders that are located on other filesystems can be separated into backup files separately. each entry is considered by tar independently from the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">To determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons & quot; & quot; & lt; files was not yet fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set the settings via the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding version of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmitted & statdat; before the tape is involved, the command will load to the drive. for some drives, this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, try & kdat; to block the ejection of the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work on all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is turned on, when resolving the integration of & dat, the tape will be ejected automatically. do not use this option for floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is turned on, try & kdat; the hardwary block size for the tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you must inform & dat; in any case the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If a tape is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only show a block on the tape. the contents of the file are composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n byte) The band ID. the format of this string is hostname: seconds, where hostname is the full name of the system on which the tape has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time when the tape was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be managed directly with GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incremental backups.</seg>

<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; viewer for system logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system handles the different protocol files. furthermore, & ksystemlog; experienced users access to information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer does in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system handles the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; tries to provide some advanced features that can be used to filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. this includes among other things:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog; functions available to easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After startup trying & ksystemlog; initially, the main protocol file of the system - the system log - is not displayed, and it opens instead of a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; most likely not with system administrator privileges. the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the folder / var / log, for normal users usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion or after specified strings. in addition, the list of the log lines will be changed automatically, so only log lines will be displayed next to the filter. in the default setting, a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term will then only be matched with entries in the corresponding column. for example, in the protocol file system protocol, select the process name, and then, in the filter bar, enter the name of a process, so show you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more eye-catching color as protocol lines of level hint. the colored display of protocol lines can be turned off setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you just want to show a specific process (e.g. in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use the filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the Add to new lines in the main window context menu to view all the new protocol lines added.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows you to view multiple protocol files in separate sub windows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website at http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort you will find more current information about the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; see also in the following folder of the & kde; Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; system V init editor, rather known (and also named) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V init is rapidly becoming the standard for checking the system starts when running the system in the & Linux; this is because it is easier to use, more powerful, and more flexible than the traditional BSD-Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I won't go into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because perhaps someone might attempt to switch a machine to System V init without reinstalling and reformatting. the & Linux; kernel first looks under / etc after an init file. therefore, you must make sure that the old init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV init differs also from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">System services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services, on the other hand, do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls are to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is actually no use of it. you can also run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches for init in several places and starts the first one that it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. in the beginning area you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change this then you can edit / etc / inittab manually and change the 3. if you have messed up something, then you come to repair it by restarting the system and executing the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the correct scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you'll probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init system services? quite simply: each of the scripts is written so that it accepts an argument such as start and stop. you can actually start these scripts from manually on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it includes a K, the script will be called with the argument stop. if it includes an S, the script will be called with the start argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server runlevel that runs only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; also, I could also have a user runlevel, that & eg; & kdm;, network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult, because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or any other pointing device is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six running level to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts around Runleveln or change the position within a level by pulling it elsewhere. this will only happen if they pull out an entry from the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved when you drag them into a new area. to simply copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the contextual menu and insert it into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorter number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries that have been put into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the different working areas (Available System Services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another running level, move it to clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runlevel (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorter number or the name of an entry manually, press the button to open the properties dialog. use the tabulator button to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to reject the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are saved in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are removed from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if available. otherwise, they will be restored by & ksysv; changes to the default settings are saved in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard-leveling, and now the machine is constantly restarting. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt in linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the standard running level to a reasonable value (3 should normally be ok).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for executing under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are launched in these distributions will simplify the configuration for the proprietary implementation programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution, please check that all configuration files are available, which are required by the system service (and also, if they are in the correct directory). some services (such as eg; Apache or httpd) just end without a message if their configuration files are not present or incorrectly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, may even be different from version to version. if you are using a different distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that you can attach it to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To begin with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the section adaptation of & kuser; read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you must save them. either use the corresponding symbol of the toolbar or the Save in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">The main window consists of two flashcards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry. it appears the user / group properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some card cards are only displayed when you have advanced system settings. only when you activate space limitations (quota) for users will create a map that allows you to customize individual settings. other cards appear, if shadow passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD UNIX.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The password management card card appears, if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD environments.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card only appears if for at least one filesystem space limitation (quota) is enabled and initialized (recognizable at the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system).</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be individually set for each file system. the current file system is selected using the Filesystem Filesystem with space limitation.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The groups that belong to the user can be found in the Primary Group. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The Properties dialog contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, mark this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the user or group menu, or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or the selected group works analogously.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO bootmanager, add, remove and change the boot password, change the time to boot the standard operating system, add the default operating system, remove, change operating systems, remove, change and more.</seg>
