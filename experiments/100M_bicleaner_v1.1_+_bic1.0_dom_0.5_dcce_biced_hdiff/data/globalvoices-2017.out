although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American authors and operated his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist , mainly because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican L@@ etter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , uncovered the mur@@ der@@ ous plot of an oil magn@@ ate who wanted to occupy the highest federal court with judges who were willing to occupy his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was as if that was the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the US had only intensified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I always said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I even wrote a very fan@@ ati@@ cal love letter about his great@@ ness .
then came Donald Tr@@ ump .
much has been written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascen@@ sion is for me as he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never stops in his mind behind the mountain , as you say so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague put it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , the people responded to his statements and voted in pairs for him .
the 13 million votes he won during the Republi@@ can elections was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever reached .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ?
I couldn &apos;t reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I had met during my time in Phoenix .
for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism programme that records people from all over the world , a deep faith man with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
he did not agree with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er .
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I had met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at play .
it is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fights the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
she still fits the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me get used to the complexity of American life with much patience and grace and my colleagues .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er advice helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump took his way to the nominated Republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a hold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly White , gave the presi@@ dency to a man , despite - or perhaps because of his contemp@@ t for non @-@ white people .
the confrontation with the idea that people voted for tr@@ ump because they either shared his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look those things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the plat@@ former as ra@@ cists .
to classi@@ fy people , one of my friends said , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superficial and respect@@ ful , suggest@@ ing an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , voted for tr@@ ump because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , perhaps they wanted to say that they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
but one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comment@@ ates on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks at those who look different from him .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( O@@ B . ) : as much as &quot; White against all the other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; ; word game from white in all@@ usion to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as the big Van Jones described , has just killed what America has made so great .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - what faith or background one may have , America is welcome everyone .
for this country chose as its President , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan whose story , as he says himself , would not be possible anywhere else in the world .
with the choice of Donald Tr@@ ump , however , a huge part of the white American continent promises this promise and says : to hell with multip@@ licity , freedom of religion and the whole notion of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
with all this , I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; Mr. Khan asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd responded with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried and their voices lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would anyone who is not like you should have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and vocal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded by saying : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , that &apos;s not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the country , for which his son had fallen , sent him a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is now &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the message said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , couldn &apos;t find a place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

from the misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish
the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what has the Mexican Music School of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the O@@ ax@@ aca province shared with the children of the Paragu@@ a@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
the music played at both locations has not only changed the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill site , only 16 kilometers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town , which is very popular with tourists , but worlds apart from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome poverty around them with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces in Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and ban@@ de violence .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and gave the youth a rare hope of hope .
the young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Noti@@ ci@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come out of school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
you will always laugh and play with shiny eyes and play in the whi@@ rl@@ wind you learn to play trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , horn , drums , bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from garbage
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometers south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is practically located at the top of the largest land@@ fill site of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ processed instruments consisting of local solid waste materials produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers under the direction of Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez have begun to turn parts of the waste into instruments .
the instruments mim@@ ic viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , contra@@ bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums , all of which were made of the rub@@ b@@ ish .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music from the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra and so on .
in an article by the Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the early days :
first it was very difficult , because we had no room for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in garbage The children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed when Fa@@ vio was shown something he had never seen before : a tr@@ ash produced from waste .
today there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments made of re@@ processed material and which is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentary called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic Wa@@ ste Management ) records the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world generates approximately one billion tons of tr@@ ash every year .
those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like the people of C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries demonstrate how technology and teamwork are able to fight illegal fishing successfully
photo © F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , practical solutions for environmental problems .
the re@@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to share content .
in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia , before it visited the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a bill of law of this species on its coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ ores , Mozambique and the Seych@@ elles were rapidly mobili@@ zing against the ship . they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fisheries authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region : he was unable to catch fish there .
in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for lo@@ oting the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( stop illegal fishing ) .
the members of this network , besides Somalia and Madagascar , are the six countries that had driven the prime minister out of their waters at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and help each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides technical support for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to detect . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , through which certain habitats and species are to be protected , can damage ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les , and also by the s@@ nail &apos;s emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions are happening in real time in real time , with trace@@ ability to the F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news on suspi@@ cious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i is also very attentive to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas . also , suspi@@ cious routes can be discovered - such as those that suggest that a ship charges its caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license , where they were on the go and possibly if they have a criminal code .
countries that are against illegal fishing can , based on this information , refuse to accept such vessels in their ports . which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pun@@ ishments , as in the case of the Premier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there is considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , managing director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to regain a estimated $ 20 million in lost revenue , which the eight members of the H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network lose each year due to illegal fishermen entering East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish , which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world .
their practices include sailing under false flag , fake license papers , imag@@ ining imag@@ inations , fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; systematically exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non @-@ seamlessly organised control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You must@@ n &apos;t walk my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now , the closed front has been working .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 research of suspi@@ cious ships .
it exposed criminal networks exposed to fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used multiple frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has tra@@ cked and found escap@@ ing ships .
because of its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international agency to fight crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over long distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us rather far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that aims to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to track down the illegal vessels that they like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , head analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO who also deals with fisheries data and offers F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , some of the ships switch off their automatic identification systems , which they cannot be ordered by satellites .
therefore , Cop@@ eland helps build a system that connects different levels of information with each other . it aims to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to find criminal acting ships with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oce@@ ana Marine Protection Agency : a platform that provides satellite data and can be viewed worldwide through the position of every single track@@ able ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who &apos;s doing - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project in which a global system allows the pursuit of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities do not only detect criminals but also deter them .
ships that formerly f@@ ished without licence and had hardly any consequences , now know they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i have reported a 33 % increase in fisher@@ y turnover since f@@ isher boats buy more licenses .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found tra@@ w@@ lers there on board , whose use is prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ il@@ u says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several hundred million dollars are lost annually in West Africa by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , six countries joined together , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they too fight illegal fishing , according to the exact same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; With certainty , the aim is to make even more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state of Somalia was able to report his first major triumph : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship sailing under false flag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship has also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters , reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the adoption of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ber@@ gh says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collaborative approach to protecting the oceans really works across the oceans .

street movements in Venezuela appear to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the removal of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the government of Venezuela rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on im@@ pe@@ ach@@ ment , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes the negotiations on the country &apos;s political and economic crisis fled to the void , met on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : the rel@@ a@@ ying of Venezuela ) both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found .
the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - among others in the flat land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ de@@ an regions of Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the central north @-@ lying federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country continues to deterior@@ ate , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition seen in the inauguration of the current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro the chance for a fundamental change ; however , the reluct@@ ance of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , contribut@@ ors to Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ises the context of the government &apos;s decision as follows :
within the framework of the social , political and economic crisis , in which inflation and profits are among the highest in the whole world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % to the end of the year ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching shortage of food and medicine exists , the referendum on im@@ pe@@ ach@@ ment for many as the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance called Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( for example : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together . in addition , a twelve @-@ hour strike on the following day and a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government headquarters , were planned to continue on 3 November .
the call was commented on Twitter as follows :
it is Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil war and on 3 November all to Car@@ ac@@ as to Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace .

the images of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify , among other things , an overwhelming participation of people in many areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen as well as advoc@@ ates of the government .

on Twitter pictures are pil@@ ing up of disputes , as well as reports of oppression and mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
especially big waves struck the news of police repression in the centrally located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the prot@@ esters returned to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the state of T@@ á@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear a skir@@ ts , because otherwise you could see something that many National Gu@@ ards don &apos;t have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic shows the amount of repression per day :
thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the demand for a ten@@ ure procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of signatures are fake .

on the road !
others consider these protests as a further step in the fight against a government which , from their point of view , has made little effort against the disa@@ strous economic crisis and has rather busy keeping critical voices silent :
they took us so much - but also fear !
mar@@ ches increasingly take on frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news site .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to witness the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine city of Cór@@ doba .
as a grown @-@ up man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now said in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province Cór@@ doba against his father .
in the trial ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship were investigated .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he retained the family secret for himself .
in the situation at that time , I believed that it was all right .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years of age , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time , I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer and a mur@@ derer .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a police officer . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in La Per@@ la prison .

but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who was accused of kidn@@ apping in 15@@ 8 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 year old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ an@@ os &apos;s son , a man who in the course of the years recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy and who testi@@ fied before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows what great power a parent has about his child and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from sports hall to military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts .
everybody called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you befri@@ ended one of the ERP .
just make sure they don &apos;t kid@@ nap you one day and I &apos;ll have to save you .
the ac@@ ron@@ ym ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , the Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party of Argentina .
that is why he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later , he took me to the military base .
he told me I would be a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so my father had educated me .
at the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all kinds of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , everything .

&apos;@@ Sin@@ ce the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with - all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me for the second time , he ordered me to get out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - everything was possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small package wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver .
that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were shut down and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured over there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw in and saw a couch where men were tor@@ tured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they attached to it one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who had just been tied there .
they seldom tied a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ poured it with water and hun@@ ted him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch inside was terrible ... like a fil@@ thy wind .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I immediately recognized the smell again and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ I knew these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied and tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying down with the face - all were tied at hands and feet .
near the entrance , people kept quiet on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I was seeing the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why do you look so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you bring me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were cast into a pit , and were put to death by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me about it at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , there were some rooms designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero put together a man there and killed him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to information from the survivors , the civilian is Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , head of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way on which the kidn@@ apped came here .
if you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be reloc@@ ated .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; boot@@ y &apos;
my father brought home all sorts of stolen stuff .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at that time I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boot@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - as they called it - was . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when I was later in the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war boot@@ y is a bay@@ on@@ et , or perhaps military blu@@ ffs , which you have fought against an enemy you have fought .

but if one goes to a house and the fridge , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then this is not a boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the head of the security forces , was able to participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
once he called me a criminal and I answered : and you who steal cars on the street ?
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded with rage , stroke me and scre@@ amed :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you go so far , I will find you and kill you . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do so !
that &apos;s how my father was .
I don &apos;t have a very good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of then , on which I wore a jacket and a pul@@ ley pul@@ lover made of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we weren &apos;t poor , but he still brought clothes to home .
at that time , the defense accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator of this crime . I answered , no problem , they could burden me what they wanted .
I was there anyway to testify .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of the body is the last abom@@ inable act &apos;
now that I am older , I feel regret .
I have children . once children have children , one recognizes the value of a life .
one develops further and recognizes that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you have executed people during the dictatorship , but why the cor@@ p@@ ses leave ?
why kid@@ nap children ?
one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they would have been able to put them in jail .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why would their bodies disappear ?
did these people not also have families to whom one could hand over their mortal remains ?
the disappearance of the body is the last abom@@ inable act one can do to a human being .
my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they took machinery to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course there is always something to be done .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
the thought of showing my father came about during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I repro@@ ached him for all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I haven &apos;t killed anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly and asked myself why the whole patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they allegedly defended , were actually good .
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something about it ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he answered only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , then show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I saw the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can repro@@ ach me that I have been bi@@ ased . I finally declared against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest in May 2015 before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 cases , including severe , illegal de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 15@@ 8 cases , torture in 15@@ 4 cases , murder in 98 cases of severe cases , torture followed by death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years of age .

the Jud@@ g@@ ments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ ac@@ om@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the size of the Jud@@ gment in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses have been heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended in August 1975 and December 1978 as a crime against 7@@ 16 victims eventually in August .
43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity , and in 28 cases the court suspended prison sentences and in nine cases prison sentences between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ Jud@@ gment : murder , torture and rape by officials .
all defend@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police and civilian employees .
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped along with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human minds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine@@ an organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , representing the children of the people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but the research lasted for 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government handed over the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that there could be a memorial to be erected , which is now being run by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a centre in Kyoto , where you can extend your driving licence .
the photograph was spread in the social media .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can extend its driving licence , last month witnesses of a very particularly failed translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a sign the Japanese word ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older car &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; was mistaken - but perhaps also with malicious h@@ ass@@ le &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the false translation was to be read on electronic advertisements in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September .
adaptation of Joshua Lev@@ ine &apos;s original photos , widely shared in social media .
the error was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , which is to be released in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could there be such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to older people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the faulty English translation was first removed . the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the more appropriate , albeit gram@@ mati@@ cally correct term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture are sorry for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already included in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for their accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger told us about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that elderly people felt offen@@ ded by insufficient correc@@ tions ( the translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News looked somewhat more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been denoun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of elderly drivers who are involved in accidents throughout the country is a cause of concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors increased during the same period .
the re@@ porter , in particular , published comments on the light published on Yahoo , which show which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently hold against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo about the translation error received , among others , the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible car &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) not reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How er@@ ron@@ eous is the translation really not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre bugs in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
to translate , you need two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators in the target language should not be in the original language - native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ English as their mother tongue to translate the translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost @-@ determining or the relatively low number of English native speakers that learn Japanese .
some companies that do not have foreign employees themselves can produce translations internally . then , the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the confused and pu@@ zzling sentences that arise from machine translations show that this technique can &apos;t replace a human translator for a long time . this is particularly true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest British form@@ ulations in Japan , including en@@ ig@@ matic prints , often embell@@ ish t @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r users Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery . but from large companies or government who have the means to ensure higher standards , we can expect more careful translations .
in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more rep@@ utable source for their translations .
Venezuela : protest and cens@@ orship in the Internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ al con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users announced that they had no access to the online broad@@ caster Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the internet presentations of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ o@@ lio TV are no longer accessible .
other online channels also transmitted recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organized by opposition groups , resist@@ ing the government of Nicol@@ ás Ma@@ du@@ ros .
the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dis@@ b@@ anded Parliament and handed over the tasks of parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ te . he pointed out that the connection was overl@@ apped and recommended users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# Zen@@ sur : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that the Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet sites are re @-@ locked .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offerings such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans with Internet access , especially in periods of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been reluct@@ ant since 2014 to report protests . at that time , the Commission for T@@ elecommunic@@ ation threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again .
it is surprising that it is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ ov later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels .
previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , has shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server answers incorrect or refuses to request such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
for V@@ PI@@ TV , a third channel , the transmission was suspended on Thursday , 6 April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera operator El@@ vis Fl@@ ores , who carried out the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was det@@ ained .
Fl@@ ores was beaten while he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on show again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ ans access to multimedia coverage of the current events in the country more and more difficult .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to get an education
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child of Cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collects testim@@ onies from other crimes , just as they were victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a landmark report published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying C@@ ows , Pro@@ mis@@ ed Schools &quot; ) edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation from the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house spoke of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one from which something has become , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ tas , in Paraguay there are more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls forced to work to go to school .
the business is very simple : a big family with little money leaves her minor son or her minor daughter to another , ri@@ cher family . in exchange , the child gets food , a training and a roof over the head .
but what is not mentioned here is that the children have to do countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all that within the framework of a contract which cannot be abol@@ ished .
this practice referred to as cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organizations .
after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a number of years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls were affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collecting testim@@ onies , resear@@ ching and denoun@@ cing .
she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of gratitude which is ino@@ cul@@ ated to the Cri@@ adi@@ tas generally guarantees silence .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , it is the family that gives their daughter in the belief that they complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; to another family .
on the other hand , the family that assimil@@ ates the girl and justi@@ fies its exploitation with faith means giving someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and maybe even star@@ ved .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will learn about it until many years later .
sometimes they even never find out about it .
in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon occurring in the hidden in Paragu@@ ay@@ an households was seen as a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín entered the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of violent blows . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military unit Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the local population office .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their home in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ rei@@ ra took a stick to Mar@@ ín until she suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela bl@@ amed the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go deeply rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society for the girl &apos;s death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they described the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a modern form of slavery &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; several dozen people came to protest demonstrations and demanded that there was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no further Carolina &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; compla@@ ined Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without official documents it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live .
the couple &apos;s neighbours and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a quick enquiry into the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be pioneering - for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , in which her father worked , had to register bankrupt@@ cy and her father lost his work .
their brothers now had to work all and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money .
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón as Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
in her employer &apos;s house , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
she had to divide the time in such a way that she was still time to learn .
she stood at five o &apos;clock every morning and prepared breakfast for her employers .
for example , it cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went home again and had time for learning .
the more she was finished with learning , the more spare time she had .
but also this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but didn &apos;t get in@@ definitely food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was allowed to bring more books from the household library than food out of the fridge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she recalls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ izer of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
at some evenings the house@@ keeper Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand next to him and read editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince them not to believe in the reports of the official media about the regime of the dict@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he thought she was intelligent but did not enter@@ tain her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the owner had found someone who listened while talking about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they thought I would &quot; learn bad habits &quot; again . &quot; this meant that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belonged to the indigenous group of Guar@@ ani , would again speak their mother tongue Guar@@ an@@ í .
their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made for her , she explains .
she was fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
also in school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ minated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never spoken about is bul@@ lying and har@@ ass@@ ment that Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exposed when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anybody to home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships arose , I felt particularly clear that I was not a member of any group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Company appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where we can share job advertisements for cleaning personnel and pa@@ edi@@ atric girls in Paraguay .
the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ cill@@ or in the district of As@@ unci@@ ón .
hello ! I am looking for a little girl for my little daughter playing with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please report to us .
start from Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the village Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had an el@@ event@@ h girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the hear@@ tland that wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the authors of the advertisement folded once more :
dear friends , I found one . I &apos;ll see if it works with her .
thank you , I write again when something is .
the business was completed .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report of Cri@@ adi@@ tas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ adi@@ tas , for how long ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ adi@@ tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history , we have managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from Paraguay &apos;s early history ) , where the Spanish Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of the Guar@@ ani ( slaves and slaves ) , and the system of Mens@@ ú ( where the workers were treated as semi @-@ slaves ) .
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and that to display power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill prescri@@ bes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians recently agreed to draft a bill on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Regulation on the use and benefit of social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when it is adopted by parliament , users of social media in Egypt must be registered with a government authority in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a job would then be set up to give citizens permission to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users must be registered on the site with their correct names and ID card numbers to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , it could result in a penalty of up to six months imprisonment or a fin@@ es of money .
the draft law , which consists of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ ses in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs and is used over the Internet to communicate with others by voice , video directing and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities want to impose the registration . it is not clear how they should account for those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is not currently able to ensure the regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , MP and suppor@@ ter of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users of the telecommunications ministry received a username and password to get through the fire@@ wall blocking Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall at national level around Facebook . because of those , it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity in order to access the network .
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on the ground are scep@@ tical of the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist , at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I strongly doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I take it seriously , it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who request approval or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to lead them to a trial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is technically not realistic , but everything is possible in Egypt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether its adoption and enforcement will succeed or not , the draft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in parliament , in which the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no dis@@ sent@@ ing nar@@ ration is present on the screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ y@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime in which a life imprisonment sentence was intended for those who are found guilty of threatening the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;
how Kurdish nature conserv@@ ation@@ ist protects the Persian le@@ op@@ ard in Iraq war

this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions .
high up in the Kurdist@@ an region in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal prot@@ ector H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ard .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which ro@@ ams through Africa and Asia , belongs to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus Sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature .
why is this certain kind of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem is also dependent on the existence of a large predat@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video therefore states that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a is passionate about a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wildlife and educational programs for Nature Iraq for six years now .
since 2013 , it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to establishing protected areas for wild animals in the Kurdist@@ an region .
Sebastian Meyer , an award @-@ winning photographer and film@@ maker , has produced this video for En@@ sia .
his works have been published in numerous international publications including TI@@ ME , Sunday Times Magazine , FT Magazine , Washington Post and The New York Times .

at the beginning of March 2017 , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the left @-@ wing daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , documented the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atomic disaster in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma caused the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which lies in the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture was a state pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s north @-@ east , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were ev@@ acu@@ ated by sev@@ ens , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had let whole coastal cities disappear from the map .
in addition , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had a nuclear accident , already alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows from a local point of view what progress has been achieved six years later to rebuild the life of the local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority and survey results of the patients themselves .
the residential building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned surro@@ gate houses ( for the most common , seasonal , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ k ju@@ ch@@ ak@@ u ) were finished in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , and 80 per cent of the planned spare homes were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light at 70 percent .
however , even six years after the disaster , it is still hard to reloc@@ ate into final replacement houses six years after the disaster , ev@@ acu@@ ated by accommodation shel@@ ters .
after the triple catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 still 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such dwell@@ ings .
almost 40 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful at this point . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ees , who cut their homes after disaster , were moved to final homes .
for I@@ w@@ ate the number here is 34 percent .
the status of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools affected by accident have opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while almost 100 per cent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident have deeply affected agricultural land in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agriculture .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i recovered 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma again .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farm@@ land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are located in the &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has largely recovered , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far off .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only exhibit 75 percent here .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that since the disaster almost half of the inhabitants of the coast , it is more difficult to earn their living .
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to be able to determine the overall picture , the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the ev@@ acu@@ ees .
in her introduction of this article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of the respon@@ dents said that there was still not enough in regard to cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es prevention .
how it is about those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its edition of the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma did not only have to witness the tremendous earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed .
of 160@@ ,000 ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 there were over 23@@ ,000 people res@@ ett@@ led back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , in permanent replacement homes .
after the stand of 2017 still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma live outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas most of the ev@@ acu@@ ees are older than 50 years old . they are known to reti@@ re right away because efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people come across from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one often recognizes that one is more connected than it seems at first sight .
these global links are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we cover topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone about language and country borders .
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ manu@@ man explains how a hike has strengthened her affection for Iranian culture ; Viol@@ eta Cam@@ ar@@ asa talks about the time she worked with people from around the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being hit by the police during national demonstrations

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva in a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week to the intensive care unit : last Friday , a police officer had struck him with a bat@@ on against his head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . nation@@ ally , millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity measures .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the German University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on him this Saturday and now transferred him to an artificial coma .
his condition is regarded as critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a hammer . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás have announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the end of the investigation into the incident of the active ministry .
the pictures show the police officer how he hits the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be on TV for six months and the entire repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ eu@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a media channel by media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z in the network , where you can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs ha@@ sten to him .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , is also sur@@ faced in social networks .
in the clip shown below , you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus living in another state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the costs of medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is hospit@@ alized .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police violence . &quot;
the drawing was shared several times in social networks .
by : Hei@@ tor Vil@@ ela . release with permission .
on Facebook , Professor Pablo Or@@ ell@@ ado recalls other acts of violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás has experienced a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ er@@ me Irish was killed by his father , because he under@@ mined the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , the military police of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App group was killed , and here we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva who was attacked by a police officer who struck him with a bat@@ on .
police custody account
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil in which it came to brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators last Friday .
police officers were deployed in protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set up a platform for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
the MEP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to refrain from speaking about violence against demonstr@@ ators .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media have covered street protests by focusing on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de São Paulo were specifically reporting a broken glass window to illustr@@ atively design their titles with a photo .
on the other hand , O Glob@@ o favor@@ ed a cover story with a bus set on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible reason to report more about a broken window of windows than the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly against any form of material damage .
here , too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; gets an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violence of the military police is covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation with the police . &quot;
villages forgotten by the de@@ indu@@ str@@ alization of Cuba
with the introduction of the Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso law , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba closed their doors ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the local community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill , not@@ withstanding that there is no appreci@@ able sugar harvest on site .
it is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ sed .
after succ@@ um@@ bing , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost its plants , until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
other res@@ igned and comm@@ uting daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who opens every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which have been put into operation after a long in@@ active period of time , because they have been preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene recalls to have heard that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich would be the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry has already resist@@ ed the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a motive for concern over the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are not news anymore .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old railway platform of the municipality saw already better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically obsol@@ ete , and hardly competitive they became un@@ sustainable for the country .
the initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories , the annual production goal was 4 million tons .
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for maximum 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar@@ s must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report &quot; Agricultural perspectives &quot; issued by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations agricultural and food organisation .
if present production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar exports would generate around 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will surely go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cuban president F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the years that followed , the shut@@ down of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full wages for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez was working in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he repeated most is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they constituted a full @-@ time working group .
the first letters began before the first anniversary year .
it was a matter of officially auth@@ ored documents that would be distinguished only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on the responsibility was over and the letters became more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the shut down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in use , &quot; he ass@@ ures .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , is waiting for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was against his will at the shut@@ down of the factory , in which he helped build .
with each part he removed , he dis@@ mounted one of his 31 working years .
the most developed industrial area in Cuba and the most important work de@@ generate was wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , no alternatives were created for the jobs and services generated in the communities in which they were located .
we will never know whether during the Mam@@ mut speech of 21 October 2002 , the then president in the eyes of those present , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in use , everything would go well .
the price of the population for closing the sugar cane factories
since 2004 , sugar cane is only extracted high by grinding .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years , the local community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to deter them , they also stopped to pi@@ erce the road , and this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other establishments .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they have to be replaced .
without the prospects of the future , many young people also left the region .
a food factory has been created in the area , whose production is not even for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
nin@@ ety @-@ nine crops bring the old soldier a rent of two thousand p@@ es@@ os a month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a supporting person , yet he does not forgive the lies he told him .
they have been tor@@ turing him for ten years .
N@@ ene walks in retirement at the age of 65 , not because it lacks power , but because it is bitter .

first Nations young people use hip @-@ hop to express themselves and get their own culture

young people from the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them . they do so with hip @-@ hop , thanks to a series of walking workshops .
since 2014 , as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour , workshops guide mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were conducted by educ@@ ators David Ho@@ dges who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then collabor@@ ated with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
the workshop thus hei@@ gh@@ tens the fact that the young participants explore topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , engagement , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes into mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations Communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ ales First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a road section in West Canada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered .
most of the cases have not been clari@@ fied .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motive of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people did not always speak the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation recorded , the refrain is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars hip @-@ hop group , who gave them a st@@ rop@@ he in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dialect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the St@@ rop@@ he is available in tran@@ scription , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like no one ever cares for me
but I try to continue my days on earth
this is the day when you will hear our cry
because we lost our way in life as a youth
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and go ahead as well as our youth
so they can do what they intended for the Creator
in the comments section , the reader and advocate of Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also contributes and adds the drop in sy@@ ll@@ ables ( which is published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
in Japan plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( for the most popular ones ) outside a typical Japanese restaurant .
pictures of fli@@ ck@@ r users sa@@ yo@@ t .

in Japan you can see some plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , close to the entrance to sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( for example , &quot; S@@ culp@@ tural models of the dishes &quot; ) are exhibited by each dish served in this restaurant .
customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether they are entering or going on in the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the town of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi &apos;s to@@ ki@@ er district there are a variety of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes that German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them . however , a new trend is now turning them into conspic@@ uous cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in the special sale : new mobile phone tapes decorated with plastic dishes as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have been converted to kit@@ sch@@ y collections , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are a few sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food orders is becoming increasingly more complex .
in this case , a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular bowl of seafood ) was transformed into a mobile stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile phone stand .
we also made this part of the exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that is only the beginning of an increasing departure into the com@@ ical .
some mobile phone stands and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or nit@@ rous oxide is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile with nit@@ rous oxide ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest mobile stand has the shape of melting ice .
there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands from dried salmon .
further qu@@ ir@@ ky plastic dishes can be found at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow the h@@ ash@@ tag # for the h@@ ash@@ tag # .
if you would like to learn more about the origins of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in testim@@ oni@@ als and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the desp@@ ots and killed regularly appear only in statistics . however , they do not at all reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
reporting on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , head of the sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict perfectly into the background .
the day after a violent incident hardly anyone looks at the mour@@ ners or the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind every single ridge , behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never heal .
that is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; learn to live with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) .
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project like this :
organised crime is not just a matter of fear of our lives .
the effects are much deeper .
for example , if businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole municipalities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
a video titled &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how Fe@@ ar Life Chang@@ ed &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ up@@ e , a father who searches secret tom@@ bs after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on just one day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today for the task that we have set ourselves to go and search for graves , according to the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ up@@ e Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras , Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training .
there is also my mother who is here with me as well .
at the moment she has no income .
you are the insurance of my father , but they don &apos;t get paid out because they demand a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only have to show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a writer of animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I &apos;ve known illness and sensation@@ alism for some years now .
I pass every day to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the front pages with images that can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from experts from specialists .
it brings me out of my compos@@ ure .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I can &apos;t be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 year old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealer ) when he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ action of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified by the fact that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so@@ aking up &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they do not stir and remain silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the capital district : how a family with threats has been pl@@ under@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain never passes away , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we will contact you only if it is absolutely necessary .
the farther we are from each other , the better .
she concluded her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will be kidn@@ apped or killed .
I asked myself in these terrible days whether crying would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation drawn by violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions such as : who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age whose parents care for them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he tells him that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , cook potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottles of water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of age .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - in@@ expres@@ sible for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and he had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years before , when he saw only a few blocks from his home , the bloody body of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence by organised crime and the fight against it were mixed with the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Council &apos;s Council for Public Security and Government of the Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor called 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 kill@@ ings per day .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; in 2015 , Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data whose objective is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traffi@@ cking that has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ TION : this contribution and the pages to which he links , include pictures on which violence is represented .
the check @-@ in check is important in a moment when it comes to canc@@ eling a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but what is the year after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist .
let us take this photograph of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first release , it has been mis@@ er@@ ably used to depic@@ t trage@@ dies that took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling between picture and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tank wagon crossed the place of S@@ ange in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo , til@@ ted and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected for years and thus devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to drive .
tra@@ gically , the tan@@ ker fell victim to that .
representatives of the authorities described a fire@@ ball , which envel@@ op@@ ed dozens of houses including a cinema close by , which was full of people watching the World Cup .
houses burned and cor@@ p@@ pled cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to un@@ recogni@@ z@@ ability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Das ist Nigeria &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; by Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Monkey , January 12 , 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident train the horrible scenes of this day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies that are lined up on the ground while people look at them .
but here the story does not end .
over the years , the same photograph was repeated several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms and fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what and what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote ni@@ geri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported drastically the atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned and dead bodies were in the streets and bushes .
reports were reported , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one left to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a citizen of Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
only by way of satellite images , the following time could be depicted .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between military Nig@@ eri@@ an and the attempt of the B@@ oko Har@@ am to win country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerged from the Democratic Republic of Congo as it was wrong@@ ly presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this mis@@ use of the picture from DR Congo is only one in a number of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented regulations in Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the picture was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings .
one step further , personal comments , such as this example , fal@@ sely relate the image from the Democratic Republic of Congo to sources of mass media in order to provide arguments .
the image from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the fatal prosecution of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a lightning report published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee were able to flee , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported from the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following arose who brought these descriptions together with photos from the Democratic Republic of Congo :
this picture origin@@ ates from an Saudi Arabian news page , fal@@ sely claiming to be the President of Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ ein Being . monks and politicians allegedly participated in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from DR Congo to depic@@ t this information .
the original contribution , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be viewed here .
other news organizations that called AF@@ P as their source had also fal@@ sely attributed Th@@ ein to this statement , but did not have the picture taken from the Democratic Republic of Congo .
the global reach of false information
traces of these false cros@@ spo@@ ints are reaching back to 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures below 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the mentioned picture from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mas@@ ch of private pages , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed away false reports , some have attempted to expose fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have del@@ im@@ ited examples of abuse and associated them with the respective countries on the basis of which side they were published . thus , we want to illustrate the range more clearly than by the language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases have also been linked to each other ) , several examples may be used for impro@@ per use .
here are some cases that can now be fully felt ( on the map in orange ) :
map : news frames .
country examples of wrong copies of the picture from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries refer to pages or servers where fal@@ si@@ fications or false reports are still available .
the countries in grey are examples that , according to the metadata and information available about Tin@@ Eye , are likely to demonstrate counter@@ f@@ eit examples .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what &apos;s happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of the Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

true or false ? ) .
one side of the rum@@ ours was that the above picture shows Christians who were killed by Muslims .
Canada , 2015 .
in this article , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City ad@@ mits not only the mis@@ reporting , but also discusses the mis@@ use of the image from the Democratic Republic of Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions about the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies involved in it ( in DR Congo and beyond ) .
Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ án qu@@ em@@ ando a los cr@@ isti@@ anos &quot; ( in Nigeria they burn the Christians ) .
in this article about explo@@ sions in Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , the district is identified as the Christian part of the place .
La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica quoted as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( where it is not known whether the original report contains the image ) .
France , 2015 .
after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am , like this one , who used the picture from the Democratic Republic of Congo to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam , &quot; we have clearly seen no pages like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster , which refu@@ te this .
Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster named the faulty use of the image since 2011 in conjunction with Nigeria , then promoted by a post of US American , anti @-@ Islamic comment@@ ator P@@ am@@ ela G@@ eller .
Germany , 2017 . &quot; genocide against Muslims continues in Myanmar , Nobel Peace Prize winner is silent . &quot;
this article draws attention to the continuing need of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims in Myanmar but quotes the work of an Indian Express with the image from the Democratic Republic of Congo ; the article by the Indian Express had not included in the time of publication of our article .

this site used the picture as proof that Muslims killed Nig@@ eri@@ an Christians .
this claim has been dispro@@ ved by a Greek fact check page in 2013 and once again in 2016 .
Iran , 2012 .
an association of students of the@@ ology ( mul@@ la@@ hs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims through the news agency N@@ asi@@ m and used illustr@@ ative the image of the DR Congo .
Italy , 2015 .
an inhabit@@ ant of the Old Town P@@ ie@@ di@@ ca@@ stell@@ o von Tren@@ to posted this message on his side to express his solidarity with the massacre in Nigeria 2015 .
Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo from DR Congo was divided as evidence of the bom@@ b@@ ings of B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of an ab@@ u@@ sive usage of the image from the Democratic Republic of Congo , on the one hand expressing sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger to deli@@ mit the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya is being prosec@@ uted , since the photos have been mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government published a report on what it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intentionally fin@@ ed news and photos that came to international media , international human rights organizations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings regarding Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this judgment , which was published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ec@@ ules operated by H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to show that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often spread by the Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fundament@@ als &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political provo@@ cation ? ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this post , directed to members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims to kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein admitted to 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still included .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article , published by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by An@@ á@@ lis@@ is Digital , now deleted , has explicitly stated that the image does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture was later put into circulation in the context of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te the fact that there were connections to Nigeria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dün@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture of the DR Congo sur@@ faced with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted their communities to pay greater attention to these events , which were presum@@ ed in the name of Islam .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ret@@ we@@ aving ) . but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Chinese ) , 2014 .
after a message allegedly written by a &quot; Pater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this one in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it false .
the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos was dist@@ anced from the message contained in the picture from the Democratic Republic of Congo .
there are further confirmed examples of faulty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye also points , but are no longer fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , the Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the craw@@ ler and some have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only after 2010 , the picture may ultimately have a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong subjects or frames that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used for greater discussions about the silence related to the kill@@ ings of Christians by Muslims or - to the defense of the Muslims - the kill@@ ings of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ rated compared to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is both important , so it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question , however , is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images .
with social media there are tens of people who inad@@ vert@@ ently share the water around a tragedy .
suggests this mood of mis@@ information and mis@@ information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and det@@ ours the actual horror of what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the dis@@ sem@@ ination of violent images has already been extensively deb@@ ated ( here for example ) .
one argument is that the restra@@ int of images of refusal is equivalent to acknowled@@ ging the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images are des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ zed by readers and viewers and the ability to emp@@ ath@@ ise emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investigated how violent media act on helping others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss about violent portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , the fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news coverage .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog un@@ v@@ eils the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages

a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. conf@@ using ) stri@@ ves to offer language enthusiasts a choice of words from around the world that are difficult or not at all to translate .
there are such words in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these conf@@ using words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist ob@@ st@@ inate any attempt of a simple translation .
a word or an expression is not enough , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes some context is needed to understand exactly what is meant with this one word .
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist from &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages .
for example , in the blog you can find words from Van@@ u@@ atu @-@ cla@@ p language , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Pra@@ ise for your parents in recognition of how they have ende@@ a@@ vor@@ ed to you in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words in the H@@ uns@@ ung language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The la@@ z@@ iness or la@@ z@@ iness that one feels after getting war@@ med in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they def@@ use other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze and classi@@ fy the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page even more of these &quot; conf@@ using &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impres@@ sively these small languages are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speakers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite local wines here . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka ren@@ ders the worst floo@@ ding of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ d@@ water and land@@ slide catastrophe over the past decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally starts at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ an@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have stepped across the banks in 15 bor@@ ou@@ ghs in the south and west of the country .
according to the Kat@@ astro@@ ph@@ al Centre of Sri Lanka , May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost 100 people are missing because of the floods and mud pools .
more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100,000 people have been brought to 30@@ 4 safe locations .
the rainf@@ alls were closed on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly declined .
the health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the flood catastrophe :
flood water in Ta@@ w@@ ama town with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods make the Den@@ gue fever crisis worse , warns Save the Children after more rainf@@ alls are already on their way .
today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded because of the water level of Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a flooded yesterday .
the Air Force provided five aircraft for rescue operations and another five are made to transport emer@@ gen@@ cies for the inhabitants included in their flooded villages .
various organizations and startups have also been willing to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call + 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call now the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals in this area need help .
the taxi @-@ call @-@ app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks concerned people to share their location data with the app to inform the cad@@ ence centre .
last year after the disaster of the Trop@@ enst@@ ur@@ ms Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood subsi@@ dy &quot; button that allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations .
they also launched an &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button which resulted in more than a thousand inquiries and 150 successful boat rescue actions for people trapped by floods and land@@ slides .
the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , with which several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring people in need in safety and provide aid measures .
this has prevented the loss of other lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality .

I approved using the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and dear friend in January .
I trust in her my four years old daughter , she tru@@ sts in me her children ; she is my rock in the fire .
in the last minute , we still call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next , we are hearing rights for trans@@ gender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with a head@@ sc@@ arf high , bound from an American flag , other gu@@ ises slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their imagination .
they are terri@@ fying me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look alike .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves with being a Muslim in different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim @-@ drawer .
in our collective imagination , this drawer is so well constructed that as soon as Muslims do not fit into it , they are being alien@@ ated .
to be m@@ ated with a lim@@ b
I don &apos;t stand alone with that .
this even happened to the poet whose poetry is best sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images come to mind when you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
as Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry by the day he died .
but in the Western world , the religion of Rum@@ i was er@@ ased , just as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ ising Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting visual language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
in the 1970s , the ground@@ breaking Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid sh@@ attered the story behind these images .
but these images still stand out today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to perpet@@ u@@ ate them .
I worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I &apos;ve seen how these powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous nar@@ rations dominate our news feeds .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the US won &apos;t even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this narrative fails to recognize that when French Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women are forced to cover their entire body , both of which are two sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead the movement for change .
it also sees that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil of Afri@@ cans who had been brought hi@@ ther with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this narrative has made our collective imagination so deep and er@@ ron@@ eous , that Si@@ kh men and children often become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; others . &quot;
the 1.7 billion are among the
in the news industry , we do more than just tell stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rations which help us to understand the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims constitute the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the total Muslim population is African @-@ like Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims are among the first @-@ generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .

four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York . sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ lu@@ r Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time Khan had re@@ invented the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were ignorant Muslims and Americans .
but am I now a must @-@ have Muslim and American ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting my Muslim recipes out , or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chief , whom all Muslims bear with themselves - &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
I joke , we don &apos;t carry all ker@@ chiefs with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also need to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be chosen almost always for additional checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim milit@@ ants and inter@@ religious activists seeking to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam hos@@ tility machinery with don@@ ors , think tanks and experts for mis@@ information that is our already faulty picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in more than just a stranger who tears the head@@ sc@@ arf .
or as the frigh@@ tening card of attacks on mos@@ ques all over the USA , see below .

I want to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but to be a Muslim was only then born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they rever@@ t to the following terms : faith , behavior and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbor , my rock in the surf would see that I am Muslim if she could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our homes .
she would see the every evening ritual with my daughter when I held her in my arms and her Arab verses to protect the Koran and call the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one that you can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim belief may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .

belonging is the image of my grandmother &apos;s mother@@ ly side with her sisters ; as they have decades ago win a contest of art of flower arran@@ ging in Kar@@ achi .
it is the picture of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings of old Su@@ fi saints ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters that she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be Muslim means to speak the prayers which she had told me when I have a bad day .
to be Muslim is how she taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people who , for centuries , have been colon@@ ised by an &quot; empire , &quot; a company founded by the name of Hon@@ orable British East India Company , it has a deep meaning to name God , my only Lord .

in the meantime , while he writes books about modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly wept for his family in the K@@ ash@@ mir family , which he was not allowed to close in half a century .
belonging is to know that there are millions Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , their families , as with my grandfather , were torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who shared the Muslim world as at stake .
to be Muslim is to know that in the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; colon@@ ised &quot; all to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of the story was dropped over a Muslim country a century ago .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , ash@@ mir sub@@ mis@@ e of the British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mos@@ que in England .
before there were planes , he travelled in more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to belong to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable pedi@@ gre@@ es ; our un@@ packed history .
it means remember@@ ing that , fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed across each continent apart from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the rub@@ ble of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy hits the US and the susp@@ ects carries a Muslim name , history four times more is reported as a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means knowing that , fourteen hundred years ago , the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liberated black slave named Bil@@ al .
it means knowing that a two hundred years ago , an African schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it &apos;s the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple hy@@ ph@@ ens , but to fail to communicate them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of 1.7 billion has more possibilities than a magic cube , but it is represented in the redu@@ ci@@ ble &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
being a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is comprised of Muslim registr@@ ations that began with President Bush and were wi@@ dened under President Obama .
it is in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists of the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that closes its borders with people from just the countries that bom@@ bard it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly @-@ list &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which largely targets Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars that we lead and the bombs that we throw in Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists of the Nor@@ th@@ western University presented a scientifically wrong image and asked them to assess groups on a scale ranging from 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .
Muslims were given the lowest score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations that we must guide
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deeply involved to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are back decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the fla@@ wed and dangerous bil@@ l@@ able prints that we get into our news editorial offices .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry trying to grasp our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the pod@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square about black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to print increasingly Muslim writers and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope .

but I am concerned about this difficult global point of time in which we are located .
and this moment has consequences beyond 1.7 billion .
there is a reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who exist in the dark corners of the Internet now lead the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they grew expon@@ enti@@ ally because they made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years earlier , they had not yet given them ; now they have ma@@ stered large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but who today made me an un@@ bound Muslim .
things I left here like a bread cr@@ umb line in my speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; things that may evo@@ ke memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that constitutes our humanity , a story may l@@ ur@@ k where someone is made to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversations take place within the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .

we all need to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are w@@ aged and included people by creating the &quot; other &quot; in the public presentation , was even more scientific from Stan@@ ford four decades ago .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions to soli@@ di@@ fy the &quot; other &quot; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March because the occupation means that we have a new future where we do not have a president who bombs chocolate cake while he already bom@@ bed countries and &quot; to others made &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity
story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r users Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to get in touch with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the conf@@ using blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to obtain and appreciate the linguistic diversity of big cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
the following applies to the cre@@ ators of the project :
the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that embrace diversity - secure spaces where inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to belong to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is often associated with understanding , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events are instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to appreciate , feeling , soci@@ alizing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , story@@ t@@ ellers must first introduce and translate their story in their own language or explain them in English .
even though the participants are not a professional story@@ t@@ eller , their devotion and representation lead to the fact that the audience gets involved .
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso that is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the story@@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also sei@@ zes the opportunity to explain the customs of story@@ telling typical of her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ ara tells the tale of the h@@ are and the b@@ abo@@ o in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after explaining the meaning of his f@@ able , John Ny@@ amus@@ ara asks : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; he shares his feeling of inclu@@ si@@ veness with a broad smile :
you have listened to it !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project can come into contact with T@@ LS in order to organize their own story@@ telling performances .
Puerto Rico calls for the US to re @-@ establish public debt
with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounts to 72 million US dollars , various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 ; the March started at the pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ental Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civi@@ c front for the ne@@ ural verification of debts ) and the East @-@ Com@@ edy church meeting in Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates for re@@ establishing the debt also submitted a petition to the official home page of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Rico claim that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for the debts are held accoun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debt , with a firm remuneration ensuring our working conditions , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to reconci@@ le themselves with declining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not in the sovereign territory of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
this is why the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organisation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a large restructuring of the state infrastructure .
without the participation and conviction of the citizens , imposed measures will be in danger of being rejected by the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration was called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

the book , which was published last year , is roy@@ alty @-@ free , contains a series of articles dealing with the free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
this book would like to discuss how movements need to be built for free knowledge and what the real costs are associated with .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and celebrated internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was stri@@ cken out of the directory of the A@@ dra prison where he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
we have since then no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and family a voice that push@@ es for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom , right away .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have let us start thinking about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
what have we given up in this process of occasionally extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution to an unknown place .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police &quot; Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of an &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people on November 12 , 2015 , who were self @-@ insi@@ ders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
however , his where@@ ab@@ outs remain unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ le &apos;s cultural prototypes was more for@@ esi@@ ghted than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the world &apos;s most important archaeological sites , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ lizations , merging Greek @-@ Roman architectural styles with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would make everything possible to wipe out this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Syria but the world .
this expedition into the digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule , which will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in jail :
I spent all my life in dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el brought English to me even when he was in jail .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who has asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use computers as well as smartphones .
he taught me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theoretically without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ dig@@ al which she wrote to her husband in 2012 @-@ 2015 when he was in jail .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together on the book for a year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English .
the book is available roy@@ alty @-@ free .
book cover by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is happening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens at every visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the mind in the moment we embrace ,
that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards
I forget the crow@@ ding of the prison
and I enter into every detail of your voice and words .
whom I carry with passion ,
when your eyes say goodbye
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to rec@@ laim all the moments ,
and over your absence to we@@ ep and smile .
I bear witness to myself that I will return soon ...

and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ le &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the 2011 protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those who were arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in prison until 2016 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we repeat our demand today in the hope that we must do this for the last time .
Mozambique : back to previous post due to corruption convic@@ ted director
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mozambique re@@ acted with anger on a corruption case where a member of the government returned after half his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus where corruption was committed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years imprisonment in 2010 , together with four other accused due to sc@@ attering 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( some 800 000 Euros ) .
the money came from public funds of the airports of Mozambique , the Council of which Cam@@ ba@@ za ruled between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for his re @-@ adjustment to the company , which happened on April 19 then .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which evaluated the motion , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ ba@@ za to resume his old post as the company did not undertake any disciplinary proceedings after his detention .
however , many inhabitants do not call this action good .
in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , C@@ IP ) condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the Director :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression regarding the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company should have initiated a disciplinary action against the contrary .
the company apparently remained silent and did not indu@@ ce appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; disgu@@ ised &quot; :
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had been shut down .
he could give paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish up his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has con@@ s@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inflic@@ t damage .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za likes to be paid for his silence .
re@@ pul@@ sive !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says , the director doesn &apos;t have any mor@@ als :
Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ts him and I can &apos;t believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that the state has already mi@@ stre@@ ated so massi@@ vely .
Cam@@ ba@@ za is not wanting to return to the state and to serve the state * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but has instead served itself only by the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself was tired of this man who was charged and ultimately sentenced to a long sentence .
to be honest , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief is in prison :
thi@@ eves belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el and will not only be remembered as the first independent president for the Muslims , but also as a sharp , one @-@ ed@@ ged and - by the way - proph@@ etic speakers .
one of his most famous oral accounts was when he confirmed vigor@@ ously that &quot; an ambitious person is capable of everything , including the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest to sell . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not that way . he changes tactics , but he doesn &apos;t turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious person is criminal at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison ; he was 10 years away and released .
and today the company , with which he contam@@ in@@ ates money , puts him under contract again . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ α@@ mps ( @ az@@ mal _ Ra@@ fik ) May 12 , 2017

&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ uses many users wrong@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or don@@ or b@@ lower . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or are generally used as ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ ors the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in Burma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma within the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alistic movements has given the word an extremely disp@@ ar@@ ate con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with racism today , but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that even posts in which they have discussed the use of the word have been cens@@ ored for their use .
furthermore , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with fundamentally different mean@@ ings which have the same sequence of letters as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , stool is written in Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ b@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a mail from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way , whether they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n .
the phrase ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) in Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were several reactions to Facebook &apos;s initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ ands believes that it will reduce the hate language of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook ought to be more analy@@ tic before all the posts are suspected of spreading racism .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you are writing on Facebook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the adjacent words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( don@@ keys ) .
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists who spread hate language have received quite a good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
while the action might send a strong signal to all that hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby users of social networks will simply start using a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to er@@ ase his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned by the social network :
... when I drew attention to this new Facebook directive , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and I was banned from posting , posting and sharing content 24 hours because the post &quot; did not meet the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example , the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asking for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to decrease racism in Burma from its platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it seems as if they have begun without a local context or technical support and have banned words like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fake posts .
if they only have a little bit more respect for the 15 million benefits they give them a big turnover , that would be great .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fac@@ ebooks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automatic cens@@ orship caused a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users . &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken off the web .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that didn &apos;t contain hate language but were still removed :
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to check if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kal@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , then heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should also inc@@ ite violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised for its failure to take control of the im@@ pending hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese pages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but instead of cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have looked better in context than on code @-@ focused initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is ending with the child marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .

the child marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law that should forbi@@ d this practice , so that the age of marriage is now at 18 .
prior to this change of the law , some members of Hind@@ u and Muslim religious communities held in practice , and in May 2016 there was a great public out@@ cry . then , brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ mal@@ aja Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere , as that , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
this happened regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contracting partner of the UN Convention on Child Rights , which defines the min@@ ors as &quot; every man under the age of 18 . &quot;
the statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children , who had already been married to 15 , was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and at 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married in the year 1997 @-@ 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media moves that were ende@@ a@@ vor@@ ing to abol@@ ish laws for child@@ birth followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this result .
but everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about saying the critics of the child marriage , they should , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this un@@ complicated situation , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the bill in general .
but at the beginning of 2017 the bill against the child marriage was decided - despite 4 Sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him the law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country must agree and let the law be announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the Sen@@ ators of the country gave a status update on Facebook , which once again posted Les@@ lie @-@ An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ res@@ at : bill against child marriage was voted in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes and not a single one against it .
once approved in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media users were thrilled , because the laws of the child marriage had finally been am@@ ended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lov@@ ell Francis &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who held a minist@@ erial post in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it took too much time and unnecessary talk , which disgu@@ ised the core of the thing , but do you know what ? the child marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and this is worth almost every price .
while Abel was in the opinion , it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ ale @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come :
public Status Update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , Excell@@ ent news !
the law of marriage has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for that - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted :
the age @-@ capable age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now amounts to 18 years regardless of religious affili@@ ation .
the draft for the amend@@ ment to the Act was adopted today , June 9 , 2017 .
there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 were present during the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all MPs who were against have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the marriage in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is no longer allowed by law .
it was a long fight ( ... )
many thanks to all the activists who fought him out .
congratulations .
a Th@@ ank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
but a possible catch comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organization in the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take legal action , the law should be passed and he seems to release his promise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it was quite legitimate , if Mahar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most social media users wished that the debate on the subject would be different .
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
rather than holding the discussion so generally , instead of talking about the problem that we , instead of talking about the problem , would say that the state protects our daughters from being ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are facing them , &quot; would you be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to judicial proceedings against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where the child marriage in different gra@@ dations is legal or continues to be the norm , although there are laws that prohi@@ bit them .
h@@ acker ste@@ els the office of the public prosec@@ utor in front of the national protests on the Russian national holiday
screen@@ print of the message posted on Sunday early on the website of the Public Prosecutor of Y@@ ar@@ os@@ lav@@ l .

the hack@@ ers posted the YouTube video &quot; He is not a Dim@@ on for you &quot; on the prosec@@ utor &apos;s website with the following comment : &quot; the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office calls on citizens not to follow the pro@@ voc@@ ations and keep away from all non @-@ sanc@@ tioned events ! &quot;
at 11.@@ 15 the message was removed from the page , but it remained in the cache .
# Charme der Provinz
on Sunday morning , the Office of the Prosecutor announced the local news service Y@@ ar@@ News that they were hack@@ ed .
by clicking on websites , Turkish users can view Wikipedia &apos;s content again
the Wikipedia page was presented on January 18 , 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright law in the United States , internationally dark@@ ened .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for more than a month Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pa@@ edia Wikipedia .
day after day , it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students as well as re@@ porters and fans of TV series defend themselves against blocking .
although many technically experienced Internet users are used to using encryption tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the world &apos;s third @-@ largest VPN pre@@ valence ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently described in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular blocking of the Internet has been taking place since 2007 , after the Internet Law ( No 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
after China Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains blocked , several mirrors ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated ) are now sur@@ faced .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform deposited all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its dedicated peer @-@ to @-@ peer network , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
despite the legal ban , the content is irre@@ vo@@ cable .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after we have heard the news ( via the lock of Wikipedia ) , we put everything in place to take sn@@ apshots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , there is the possibility to read the content in decentr@@ alized and distributed fashion .
this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cr@@ isti@@ an Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ lic@@ .org , a M@@ irr@@ or@@ seite of Wikipedia , as well Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar error pages , if Wikipedia is locked in the respective country .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices member and staff at Mozilla with the Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy @-@ address , a mirror .
you access a different URL that is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server direc@@ ts the request to the correct Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia , even if they are locked in Turkey .
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation
a sweet rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os , ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo of Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were bl@@ urred with poorly positioned motives and well @-@ balanced colors .
this motivated him to carry a camera with him and to try to strai@@ gh@@ ten the situation .
back then he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring N@@ ept@@ une fauna to the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown , right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to take photos that draw attention to Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class situation helps him in his work :
I live on the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that a le@@ op@@ ard would be on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was in and I immediately started to kne@@ el pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar seeks cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he should know it , for he was already faced with Tig@@ ers face to face :
a tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep while sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the King of the Bu@@ stan appeared . he immediately sat down , we see ourselves and he star@@ es me through the sc@@ arf @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ tern at the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation .
take a look at some of these photos below .

this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international collaborative media organization from India .
a revised version has been published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women with greatest care avoid addressing the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that they should respect the husband because of social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm , keep this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a false court and inf@@ ring@@ ed by her family and village community after she addressed a married family .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives by name is also common among men . however , they have far fewer rights to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel as well as house@@ wives , joined a unique club and became the main conversation topic of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , it is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign that is operated by the community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and advoc@@ ates the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ i has been working for seven years with her video camera to detect practices such as children &apos;s marriage up to the exile of HIV and AIDS infected , and leads these clubs .
it tells how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video showing Roh@@ ini in their discussion was about women who did not call their hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem that women can easily identify .
not to pronoun@@ ce the names of their hus@@ bands out loud is a custom which they have all du@@ ti@@ fully maintained and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful as a woman without mor@@ als .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this round of discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name so far , wanted to try out at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband stayed long after the video was over .
Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him by his name from now on .
Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club with this confidence in their luggage .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection the women tried to get the discussion going with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to tell her husband &apos;s name with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked everyone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the names of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equal ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Roh@@ ini Pa@@ i from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the breaking of an age @-@ old tradition in which married women can never pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy that she ch@@ ained only in front of herself during the whole exercise ; another decided to release the entire fru@@ stration caused by him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
even in the adren@@ aline rush about having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try at home to call their hus@@ bands by name .
and they kept their word .
in the coming days Roh@@ ini received a number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said it was a mistake .
another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini thought I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the hall@@ mark red dot on the forehead that indicates the marriage status :
why do women only need to show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband that I would carry the cens@@ or @-@ red dot when he did it too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laugh@@ ed and I stopped carrying him .
the other women have not completely left off , but think they are now in a better position to choose for themselves not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip with each disc@@ us club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in their life they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they danced and sang and talked about things that they had never thought of before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never been so honest about some things , such as our identi@@ ties attached to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say certain things , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to the clothes .
some women in the group have only borne sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most , this is okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ ine @-@ Cur@@ ta , a wide shirt over trousers , they didn &apos;t dare .
after much debate and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code , the morality associated with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled their own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them .
next , they decided to go on a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will succeed .
on the question of whether in the five months since its first discussion club has already changed , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly :
so far we have done only small steps .
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped to say the name of their husband .
some , including me , are still doing it , but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women are now wearing Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or their own dress code - lie at the end of a difficult @-@ to @-@ navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am also .
but this club gives everyone of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we &apos;re talking about and what we &apos;re doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commemor@@ ative day
the Beat@@ les in their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
on June 29th of this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the jap@@ an@@ ese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is considered an about @-@ turn in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who exclusively inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in 1964 in London , observed in 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just under five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
the people here have quickly become clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
good morning ! today the Beat@@ les Memorial Day is in Japan . for the last 51 years , they were here in Tokyo .
also today songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English lessons at Japanese middle schools .
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today Beat@@ les Day is a memorial day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doll is supposed to be John L@@ enn@@ on or not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as it is for fans , Japanese also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the well @-@ known places associated with the band .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places that you absolutely must visit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Matthew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( From the link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be bizarre enough :
good morning together .
today Beat@@ les Day is a memorial day .
right now in 1966 the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! made a pilgrimage to London and ran through Abbey Road .
we did the same last year .
and of course , some companies use the fan base for marketing purposes , such as this R@@ amen @-@ Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! today is Beat@@ les Memorial Day .
and what could that be for one day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is how the day is going .
so , we hope you are here !
&quot; &quot; &quot; follows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; h@@ ash@@ tag &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the twe@@ eter to read more about the Beat@@ les Memorial Day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bald men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia warned the population that bald men could be the target of attacks in Mozambique .

a new system of kidn@@ apping people for the organ trade , presumably for dis@@ belief , concerns the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was be@@ headed and some of the organs were taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently they conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used .
according to local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a bald man might contain gold or bring wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia of the BBC stated .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
another group , the goal of kill@@ ings for obsc@@ ure purposes , is people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN 2016 in the South African country conducted a mission to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to go to the country :
respect for bald men who travel to Mozambique are the goal of ritu@@ alistic attacks , warned the Muslim police according to the latest kill@@ ings of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange where the kill@@ ings took place .
hus@@ k Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and inhabit@@ ant of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police are already following the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and selling of their organs in the district of Mor@@ roc@@ ail@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , for probably ab@@ erg@@ ate rituals , has cultural motifs and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that a faith exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power , generating riches .
in the last days , three men were killed with hair loss problems in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha distributed on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the blog of the poor S@@ nai@@ ppa , indicating that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique :
I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mozambique , THE S@@ ME is ashamed of a country in which the teachers would be ashamed to demand sex against good grades , and others would not hurt or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country where neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald men are hun@@ ted for dev@@ out purposes or &quot; black magic . &quot;
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some have missed the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humour .
Z@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique , twe@@ et@@ ted that both the head of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ange and the police spokes@@ man Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim authorities are very concerned about the kill@@ ings of bald people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

we are deeply affected by the death of our friend Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il .
we mo@@ urn for him and speak our deeply felt con@@ dol@@ ences to his family , friends and all those who have known him and loved him .
a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) plays a key role in expanding public access to the Internet and open knowledge .
he was a close friend of many of the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our meeting of Arab blo@@ ggers in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ le &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people who were spending themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad administration .
they reported that her husband had been sentenced to death , but did not give any further information .
Bas@@ le &apos;s stay and constitution were unknown until today ( 01 . August 2017 ) , when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials learned that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , we honor all the creation of Bass@@ el as a pioneer of the open web movement .
and we appreciate the efforts of all those individuals and organisations who have been campaig@@ ning for their release over the last five years .
since 2011 and the start of the protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared , including the Syrian Network for Human Rights .
countless of those arrested by the regime or disappeared forci@@ bly are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 less than 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have come to death , the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International .
the fate of many people remains unknown .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized for liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state @-@ endanger@@ ing ) after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that calls for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China described Li@@ us case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and told a speaker that he considered it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not required to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China will continue to appro@@ ve calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or allow him to receive treatment abroad .
while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out .
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations , United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad .
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ enden have refused to answer questions about the release of Li@@ us .
the relationship between China and Norway was stag@@ gering after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon voyage to China , as exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope of unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to liber@@ ate Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us as she stated in a statement on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect China to lift all the restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family members .
they are to meet and receive all visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wants him to have the possibility of treatment abroad so far as he can help him with his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth@@ pol@@ ley , announced on June 27 that the message told the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u but also to liber@@ ate his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US Embassy &apos;s request drew a fur@@ ious response from China , with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and to make ir@@ responsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Pol@@ ley announced that China should offer to the couple the following :
protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice , on which they are entitled according to the Chinese Constitution and the legal system and international obligations .
the US sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to push the Chinese government to un@@ condition@@ ally release Li@@ u and his wife .
I call on China to un@@ condition@@ ally release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o to enter into proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany , Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets all the medical support it needs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on July 7 and 8 at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing of Reu@@ ters news agency that China had great concerns about whether the fuss about Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada and Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide Li@@ u with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u &apos;s attorney told AF@@ P previously that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to speak and contact with someone outside , including his lawyers .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada ur@@ ges China to uph@@ old its international human rights commitments , including freedom of expression , and to release the rights to exercise these rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
France and the United Kingdom
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry urged China to release Li@@ u on June 29 for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , irrespective of where . furthermore , his wife and his family are to have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information on whether France will eventually receive it .
Taiwan and Taiwan
the Council of continental Affairs in Taiwan called on China on 27 June to release Li@@ u and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature Yu @-@ Me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , expressed himself very ap@@ pre@@ h@@ ensive about Li@@ u on 28 June and indicated that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I felt personally very moved and also encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who signed Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level .
but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be regarded as a city .
this remark triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association , the Minister noted that many people were critici@@ zing the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party , because Singapore compared Singapore to other countries .
he supported that Singapore should be regarded as a city .
... no one questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices , to create this precious country , one hears that we are ultimately not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of a flight from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you &apos;re not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal countries , &quot; in view of this , he inevitably appeared un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core point of the subject , the good old ly@@ re comes up from author@@ itarian rulers to be democr@@ ats , leaving the twisted logic , since it is better suited to their power .
in the end the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam gave answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system really non @-@ answers .
he cam@@ ou@@ fla@@ ged the corresponding questions with non @-@ answers of rational nature .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion since she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clarify this point as long as it was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by releasing his commentary on his blog , he points out to the critics that one should begin to read the full address of the conference so that the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam could be better understood , according to Singapore , a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was more of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections are so uneven , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who , as leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes that , properly associated and aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review de@@ compos@@ es the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commit a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , on which country are the sovereign rights of the city Singapore back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
since it plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapur do their military service , they only defend their city but not their country ?
who does our prime minister have to pay ?
what is the value of our pink staff card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
if the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade belongs to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and has always been a city :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have anger@@ ed many Singap@@ or@@ ean ...
no one ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defence of the country above all &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; etc . , but that is not quite right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the My@@ th of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked recently his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series to reveal rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world and to show a different fac@@ et .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question that is most asked to me in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his conversation partner by asking personal questions .
&quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans perhaps cook in@@ war@@ dly against rage when they are held for Americans , but I don &apos;t mind that .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that Canadi@@ ans differs from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans bring a Canadian flag clearly visible to their ru@@ cksack when they travel .
they all love Canadi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand ... .
so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free healthcare system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are saying very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these guys south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if you &apos;d be confused with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first , being called &quot; nice &quot; means being di@@ ligent - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has its own Canadian double @-@ go@@ ver ) .
if Canada really is a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders it would be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
being harmless means being un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and paying no attention .
this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from the things that happen around you .
I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of the Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
what out@@ si@@ ders describe as &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps simply cool pol@@ it@@ eness .
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence with their neighbours .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends .
thank@@ fully for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau stepped onto the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada really sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ dy Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
a pop band famous in Thailand released a music video that par@@ o@@ des the jun@@ ta , which in 2014 took power and despite its promise to restore the civilian government , still ruled the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new song &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ ze Girl ) of the Band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells the instructions of his girlfriend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although not expressly political , the music video refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video to the song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the video uploaded on Facebook was 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last month even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Thailand blocked after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it relates to the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these videos that relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives absolute decision making over important national issues to the commander @-@ in @-@ chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious programme for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adju@@ st@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people considered by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army that over@@ sees online content and persons accused of le@@ ver@@ aging the monarchy is prosec@@ uted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thailand uses strict protection against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Maj@@ estic ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was declared in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at of the army .
one of the problems that the jun@@ ta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although security experts warn them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
the video shows how people are thrown into a black delivery van before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists sit in jail , because they allegedly caused &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users face long jail sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band that im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by Putin opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life goes on in the ruins of the ghost towns in eastern Austr@@ o @-@ Asia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society only slowly re@@ covers in East @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has now been over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ an war has officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the coal basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
various ethnic groups , such as Russians , Greeks , Asia Min@@ or , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians , lived and worked in Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , most Russians and Ab@@ ch@@ asen live in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
during the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people living in these ghost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people after barely increased over a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ story residential blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called K@@ hr@@ ush@@ ch@@ uk@@ ho@@ kas , symboli@@ ze the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are deca@@ yed and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it is hard for him to finish it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I speak to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why speak ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still un@@ ambig@@ uous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were communal centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all of which served the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded magni@@ fic@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
about fifty people live in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas , which still house one or two families , can be seen on the balconies where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in their hand , they withdraw immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother allowed us to be photographed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply prohibited us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly she leaves the destroyed building and disappears .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence farming ( cultivation of agricultural products for their own requirements ) such as animal hus@@ band@@ ry , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation .
it &apos;s difficult to get over the rounds .
the district council provides free candles and bread to the villages in the winter .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow cour@@ get@@ tes &quot;
about ten years ago an elderly woman called Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dj@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
in spite of her el@@ dest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia in order to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain in Ab@@ ch@@ asia forever , &quot; she says .
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to accept financial help from her daughter and insist she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it &apos;s very hard to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells that she and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when holidays are , we visit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we can &apos;t do this all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while telling her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; T@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; they said we could build cour@@ get@@ tes .
I have already prepared the floor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s conversation partner Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for a while .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she re@@ members the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ asia just broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take some time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha gets about $ 9 children &apos;s money for every child .
her husband is working in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ ascha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens .
she tells us that at first it was a very sc@@ ary situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time , it lost its anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war , there was hardly any work and all lived as they were right .
every day I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our conversation draws to an end , a little boy is running to us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
while they run , some of them throw stones on the ruined buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , which provide for un@@ circumc@@ ision in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it any other way .

in Mexico &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez manages a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and is here with kind permission .
on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city centre .
it is run by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink glasses frame and gold coloured earrings in ted@@ dy bear form .
it is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about $ 2.@@ 50 per night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the ant@@ ech@@ amber there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants are coming here .
sometimes , says Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez , people come in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept outdoors on cardboard boxes .
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anyone .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are ill , she bu@@ ys them drugs that they can &apos;t afford , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently .
I asked him if M@@ um Africa is an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebas@@ ti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ call@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil hoping to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it fits to it , because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister hoping to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north@@ wards .
the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans often travel together and that Afri@@ cans already speak on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et had previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will contact Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave it again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers , smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests often send their text messages when they are away to greet them or to tell her about the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the pro@@ pul@@ sion of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MS Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known , but it is not the only spark of hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have welcomed migrants in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive .
he started to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on ceilings on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking spot outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela declares that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job .
the majority of migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova M. Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez told me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children , who wanted to extract money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for accommodation and an unknown , a single @-@ parents , offered him their roof .
a few months later , the family is still living there and she tries to decide where to go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the tunnels , travellers should consult their phones quietly .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who went away .
like a proud grandmother she performs in her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair care , which she has made an art female , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly , as she briefly introduces her to me .
&quot; Ya ze fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repe@@ ats every time . &quot; you have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ in for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang by Twitter users .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a cell phone notification in which they instruc@@ t the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message it is said that the app will prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preventing access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities have also used the app for more than comb@@ ating terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because they had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group shortly after they had installed the app .
the police informed that the app was investigating and prosec@@ uting the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; damaging information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gen &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a security service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to remotely control their home network .
this app with the min@@ ors for min@@ ors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even hack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while reports on digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , displaced ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often associate extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs .
the Twitter @-@ based media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; ( for example ) , published cens@@ ored messages in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where polic@@ emen tested the inhabitants indi@@ scri@@ min@@ ately as to whether they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile message called for people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , you may be det@@ ained up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced the people to use devices intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the watch@@ dog technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; are also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , indicating that the software can lift up the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal contents .
all governmental branches , authorities and institutions affiliated with the party , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office during the operation of their computers and communication devices .
a recent report of Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities issued a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi in order to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; at the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist &quot; videos . however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is 3 million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible off@@ enses , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : all crying after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ans describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world you look at yourself and realize that you are alone in a place where everything important has van@@ ished .
everything has dissolved after and after , revealing a truth that is clearly recognizable , both from within and from outside .
one that gives honor to its name .
one that has fallen down to a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
but when reality catches you up and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cries out after death .
all doubts arise in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even though the earth is spinning on the axis of the un@@ holy . it becomes clear to you that you are caught here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone for stone .
they arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to learn &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the boss of the security service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five teenagers were killed during a peaceful protest like dar@@ nel from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; cry .
all the neighbor@@ hoods were cov@@ eted , only my own not .
for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even though I did not make high demands on a city that has been stu@@ ffed into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down somewhat after the electricity supply stopped in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I interrupted the silence by scre@@ aming &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house roof several times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice against silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to gather together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we were al@@ lied to a sum@@ p@@ tuous picture that filled my expectations with full satisfaction .
in such a moment you are aware that you release the mind from the lamp , but it just doesn &apos;t interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid down .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ am it all the way up to the office of the security service from the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say : &quot; let me hear as you cry &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; or you are only brave enough to sh@@ out if we are not close . &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes were looking forward to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really dare to look into my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I was standing in front of this building .
perhaps it was in my fol@@ ly , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure when I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t have thought that you had forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement and his father like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sed sentence is up to the present day in the nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture that I was subjected to months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I went through the yard .
in the first office I let everything I carry with me .
then again through the yard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I insp@@ ect all details exactly before I enter the room .
otherwise they have allocated me a larger cell this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share them with just one single prisoner and I must put myself immediately without waiting for their permission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the civil servant left the cell and I went back to a tried @-@ and @-@ tested method of communication : to beat the wall with his fist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell @-@ mate was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first step &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation , he finally answered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; apparently none of the surrounding cells was a resp@@ ectable middle @-@ aged man who looks like me and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in perfect darkness , no distinctive facial features can be seen on me , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers deny his existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the large cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remain .
li@@ ar .
I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to ch@@ ase all these crow@@ s that lab@@ elled on the fruits of my head &apos;s garden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the scre@@ am rang , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the color of per@@ dition , until I saw the yellow light that the Gre@@ ys imagined in person : the Ra@@ ad ( for example : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; all@@ usion to the 13th S@@ ure of the Quran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be interro@@ gated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the secret was revealed : to protect the security from us and to prevent us from releasing the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ an dialect - thus they played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mail map and betra@@ yed the narrow field of view of their world@@ view .
this is not a house , which is no country here ; it is a curse which they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero .
I enter the listening room and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions that will der@@ ail him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start as much more important with your life than join this diary and protest at demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it , not to answer .
I can &apos;t really say exactly when insul@@ ts and blows have become an ordinary means of communication for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , even though I had done nothing to earn this punishment .
in punishment in all their diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube which probably comes from the clo@@ ver .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices at your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot hold back your cry .
my scre@@ ams were not enough for him , which is why they exchanged the pipe with a cable .
during my first arrest , I asked myself if the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a waste collector or whether this was part of the normal work equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to present us the great invention of a gigantic cable from their point of view .
within one hour three of them changed , while I was still on the line .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er re@@ marked the cooling and didn &apos;t take any pleasure in it , which is why he came next to an electrically charged rod .
electricity f@@ lowed up my whole body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood .
my half @-@ naked body stretched out on the ground was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours he decided he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to go to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours passed , which happened to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted young man : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father must be fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and move , you will be moved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they always left me free .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smoked a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he sl@@ um@@ bers to his screen , sometimes to his computer , sometimes to his couch .
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips moist@@ ened with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives in the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family to flee from their village in Palestine where they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( about : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist opposing the conservative majority and questioning its tried @-@ and @-@ tested opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape .
with his music , which often deals with topics such as ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the whole Arab world . all of these issues are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man relevance , but also in cities ranging from Damascus to Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited in his thinking and he can sympath@@ ise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not openly admit it , he has a special a@@ version against American foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , have anything to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think of my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he poured in water @-@ dissolved Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; at this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee in a sen@@ sing hot day has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically speaking the smo@@ g of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the wa@@ v@@ ds of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose are primarily of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially when you look at the neighboring countries .
therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan , to drink water - in order not to land in prison .
recently , Jordan &apos;s Interior Ministry announced a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homos@@ exual front @-@ singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contradic@@ ts the country &apos;s cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concert statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the deputy and former spokes@@ woman in the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cancelled because of the singer &apos;s sexual orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which is questioning the well @-@ tried legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la under@@ estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who continue to opt for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this statement might not be simply rhet@@ oric but actually an increasingly clear emerging reality in Jordan which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b reg@@ ained traditional gender standards by em@@ itting his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust .
in recent years the number of &quot; honorary mor@@ als &quot; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside .
human Rights Watch , according to Human Rights Watch , reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure to support the women victims of attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to a law to fight crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of in@@ tra @-@ family violence can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be det@@ ained &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in jail for an in@@ definite period of time , and for their release it is often necessary for the family to do nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs Music enjoys great popularity and is known not to shy away from issues that have long been t@@ abo@@ o in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but acknow@@ le@@ dges that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit all@@ u@@ sions to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , not from politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; politics failed me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b attacks the question of Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse repe@@ ats stri@@ k@@ ingly often :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is it too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the further course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ gen@@ eity or homosexu@@ ality .
he notes that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay and les@@ bians and that comments on the equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals have been cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , to note later that his comments were torn out of context , distorted and cens@@ ored in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but it was only a processed version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b openly adverti@@ ses the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als is not contrary to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the 8th century , who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ vo , who was supposed to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph later , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ?
the real problem , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , has nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the H@@ ash@@ em@@ ite Kingdom there is nothing new anymore that the government sanc@@ ti@@ fies attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service has arrested several former members of the government and members of the teacher association , with the grounds that they are critical to the problems related to corruption @-@ rooted corruption in social media .
in view of this , the H@@ da@@ i@@ bs concert is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that is H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thought @-@ out and inner changes . it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also about &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experiencing them &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region will come closer with music , art and literature from genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and demo@@ cra@@ cies brought about by artificial methods . at least he hopes that .
until the time comes , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and consequently also resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origins of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
it is thought that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us in August . another theory states that the for@@ ts , drums and dancing were handed over over a thousand years and come from a period of time in which armies from west Jap@@ ans mar@@ ched into the Nor@@ theast to force the indigenous people of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , to their knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab a few great seats , so we have a great view .
you can hardly imagine how big these parts are ...
a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have been watching the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en again for a long time : two fixed cars are just to be seen .
but for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of a car of 18 meters was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans trade weapons against sciss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

outside appearance and care have rarely been as important as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crimin@@ ality and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hair@@ dresser .
El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima &apos;s capital - a region with a very high crime rate where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are com@@ mon@@ place .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for es@@ thetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) have led to more and more normal citizens entering into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ dres@@ sers that go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the Fris@@ eure competition &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
experts are competing against each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks from them , as can be seen in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school Augu@@ sto Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of receiving a training in the hair@@ dresser art , which enables them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a profession which is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops prior to the school year that began in March and reported some of its achievements :
in 1995 , we were the only school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud of , because we have built up this educational community for the sake of love for the children .
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with kind permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Love messages to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published by the international online magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people whom we know ?
is it not even more important to meet people who feel bur@@ dened ?
this is precisely the question of the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation and Cr@@ isti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ a p@@ or la leg@@ li@@ ación ( letters to reconciliation ) that encouraged young people to write letters to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters .
only recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to this : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government closed a peace treaty with the gu@@ erri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces Colombia ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
internationally , the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel San@@ tos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his services .
before the Colom@@ bians , however , there is still a long way to speak of true reconciliation and peace .
gu@@ erri@@ ll@@ as , who had lived in illegal camps for many years , were subjected to war rhet@@ oric and carried their arms around the clock , must now integrate themselves into the lives of civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society in turn , accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , must now take it into its ranks and support them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians had to unite and help the integration process .
and they also did : until now , thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former gu@@ er@@ illa fighters to welcome them back to society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ er@@ illa fighter - to be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the Campa@@ ign
the idea for the letter to reconciliation emerged at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an had the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
he explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine &apos;s Day on Valentine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more .
he plans to tell us to share his love with people this year , who were most needed .
thus the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for ex @-@ fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now have to find their place in society and build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace , &quot; she says .
so far more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ á .
&apos;@@ I never thought someone would be forgiven . &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation traveled to the camp to personally transfer the letters .
the members of the F@@ ARC have set themselves up as they had done before , in order to accept the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; said the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former warri@@ or led me through the camp of the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters .
when I looked into one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters live ) I saw a gu@@ er@@ illa fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down because next to him on the bed was a gr@@ en@@ ade laun@@ cher , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yet I spoke to him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never before in my life someone has written something so beautiful , that &apos;s why I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly tears ran across the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ gged him and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was tired of war , he was sorry to be all the years of the loyal companion of this comb@@ at@@ ant , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to protect him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms .
until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new Vo@@ ices
at the beginning , students and some of the F@@ ARC leaders came together for a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as early as the war and the F@@ ARC was already in hiding .
therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ideals , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state has affected the entire Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop into a political party , we can help shape society in this country more just .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a goal of this size , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of them said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
to hear those people who had never found any hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hate were only people with beautiful feelings turned around by their circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives is hur@@ ting me .
but it comforts me that all people - even those who have killed and caused so much harm , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the camp &apos;s commander in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
Colom@@ bi@@ anism was prophes@@ ied that peace would reign after dis@@ ar@@ ming .
but that is not the case .
as long as there is ine@@ quality , famine and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to take up arms , stand up and protest for their rights . and that is also fully justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC are now putting on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call on all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and sacrifice , for we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will endure many difficulties .
there will be many obstacles along our path , but together we will overcome them .
a Trans@@ woman talks about the persec@@ utions in Ch@@ echn@@ ya and the life before Kad@@ y@@ rov

it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ h@@ owa and its first publication on the website of OC Media .
homosexu@@ als and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers , including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with terror activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that is related to a Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert over the local LG@@ BT@@ Q community has not been created overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has captured international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published to address the deportation , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta , throwing a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities who arrested suspected que@@ er men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
since childhood she felt that she was actually a woman .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had learned about the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened .
out of fear of her life , she ultimately moved into the United States .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while trying to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no males more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents took the lap through the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was about to bring out a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you still honor the family , you sc@@ andal ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and finally woke up in the hospital .
apparently some women had gotten everything together and started crying .
the man fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two stit@@ ches in my right lung .
OC Media : in what wings were you placed - in the men &apos;s or the women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , my male name is still on it , but the doctor understood and laid me for the women .
I am very grateful to him for that .
when I first read his name on his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for being respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
I got threats last February .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they asked to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that it was all a lie .
they asked absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by walking up without the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official TV in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I had not changed my gender that everything was only bad , and Photos@@ hop .
I have body size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some older people once spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world that has damaged not only your family , but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too much for my mother and she laid a rope around her neck .
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time , I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later , under the window was a car with dark@@ ened windows and a license plate with a 95 .
after it happened the third time it became clear to me that something was la@@ zy .
my human rights friends beat the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you escape ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help I left the country , but then something unbelievable happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought it without registering , without notice , without notice .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage .
arrived and checked in the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t believe you would be safe just because you left the country ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
our people know in which hotel you are in . they even know your room number .
only to prove it to you : it is number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
but we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , that &apos;s a t@@ abo@@ o theme .
I still carry some traditionally Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish , I can &apos;t overcome this psychological barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with a camera , I actually do a lot of effort to look at the person they remember from their past - that is to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know anything about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for this I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who has imprisoned for one and a half months in ar@@ cane .
he said that during Ram@@ adan , no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan was barely able to wait , and he did not lock out a new wave .
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
with this I mean , they probably invite the relatives , they take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood grati@@ fication .
OC Media : are gay men still held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there are just not many .
if , above all , those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to put themselves in the court of Kad@@ y@@ row .
as far as I know , they are held there , so that they can present them as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sh@@ ould they be killed , they will show their bodies on TV and claim they have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply van@@ ished , they were deliberately exposed to radi@@ cal@@ ise themselves .
OC Media : is it just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown .
there was nothing new from them ever since .
they just took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself when these people were taken with him .
until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports yet . however , we suspect that such actions are possible .
why else would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already happened in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known in whole Gro@@ z@@ ny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer at that time than it was now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally wanted to lead us to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but finally dropped us back to the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had tin@@ ted eyel@@ ashes , wore tubes and short tops .
the Ministry of Health of Sh@@ aria has never just cur@@ bed a hair .
in front of the Russian theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew of it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we were never offen@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da@@ ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is often said to be children when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never defeated .
OC Media : how long did this time of grace hold ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row entered the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to speak about morality in television .
he spoke not about us per se , but primarily about the behavior of women .
nevertheless , one could feel how people began to change in the city .
those who had laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before looked at you at once with suspicion .
in time , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the republic worsen@@ ed steadily .
OC Media : what is your activity now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a sort of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ ac@@ re@@ ffs , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get food tickets .
I don &apos;t have a cent for that .
I discovered these people myself when I ap@@ plau@@ ded breeding places .
I am Muslim and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ ch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
so nature is , it has nothing to do with religion .
that is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to know you with fr@@ oth in front of the mouth , that there are no ga@@ ys with them .
the Da@@ gest@@ an have those who have Kab@@ ard@@ iner , the Russians also have ; on the whole planet they exist - but not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant for me to hear something like that .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
you know , many think of transi@@ ent to men who love men , and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that is a fall@@ acy .
these are two different ways - two different ways of feeling to be exact , different attitudes of life .
for me , it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I will be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all because I simply know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab ancest@@ or community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the indigenous Arab population .
over the past few months , there has been a strong increase in suicide .
the photograph of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ inc@@ iner@@ ation of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August re@@ marked the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran that is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the li@@ mel@@ ight .
he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , inability to stand up for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had lighted himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take their lives .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family patri@@ arch@@ s who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families and to pursue a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region in which a large part of the Arab ancest@@ or community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to make a living .
a century ago , the Arab ancest@@ or was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy assumed power and in 1925 took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran as well as some of the most profitable and most valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population receives little from this wealth .
it is often the victim of untreated diseases , hunger and priv@@ ations .
the Iranian regime has systematically refused the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Arabs to work in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a large number of dam@@ s , the water from the Arab areas into the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are lying .
these dam@@ s have only led to exac@@ erb@@ ating the devast@@ ation caused by d@@ rought and destroying local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ ks now rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director of co@@ operatives , work and welfare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is , who were looking for a job , completed primary school , completed 55 % of a secondary school and completed 45 % of a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aimed at cr@@ ushing the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; led to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men .
Do@@ S@@ him@@ i said that unemployment has become worse recently . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans emerging in Ah@@ wa@@ z and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
since officials and institutions prefer not to recru@@ it Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi will be deprived of access to employment opportunities across all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and comp@@ el them to earn their living outside their native land .
there are people who had to change their first and last name in order to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and become so disgu@@ ised , because even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes .
given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi have to endure , human rights activists stir up the alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world awak@@ ens and takes notice thereof .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; why I don &apos;t identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ als &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . released under the CC@@ 0 Creative Com@@ mons License .
the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the website of A@@ fro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - react with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well @-@ thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all feminine .
for example , women nowadays still earn less money than men despite equal education .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms always make sure that women sooner or later come across a glass ceiling in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and denom@@ inations .
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced and I &apos;m suffering double and triple .
I am a black woman .
and yet , when I am talking about skin color , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; when I mention how we have always been mis@@ used in racial se@@ gregation and discrimination , both in and out of the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists decide to remain silent .
however , they all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; sing their voices and &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , &quot; to sing my Lord , &quot; in order to achieve equal rights ( some ) of the women .
but they do not want to say that in addition to sexu@@ alized violence there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist @-@ motivated violence , which we are exposed to black women in two ways .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background tend to be referred to school more often than white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all people of any skin color the same rights ; on the other hand , as a black woman , I cannot join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands , who refuses to take into account ine@@ qualities in her mind , which relate to the sex as well as to the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech in 18@@ 51 : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I too refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical sense an alien@@ ated and margin@@ alized being . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join groups who also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropri@@ ation in order to advance their ego@@ centric program .
I will no longer seek to suggest white women the importance of over@@ cutting skin color and gender . for some of them continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to teach them for the better .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different origins a home and distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I prefer to get rid of myself completely from femin@@ ism and join the movement of wom@@ an@@ ism that was called for my dark skin and status as a woman , rather than using myself for a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so ob@@ st@@ inate that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever before that we define black women to us according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ ark@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ anism : how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , mental , emotional , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement , of which the black woman is concerned .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can raise black women and women of other cultures , for in this paradigm I exist .
I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my being .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life is neither ignored nor ignored nor rejected .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on international efforts to solve environmental problems .
as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again .
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled to Iraq in the last seven years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern of the Kurdist@@ an Region in Iraq . his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Water@@ front Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ Based Alliance - committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video Mus@@ a sum@@ mar@@ ises the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we don &apos;t have water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and edited by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one of Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist .
the focus of her work is traced to neglected , poorly observed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with which help supp@@ ressed communities can tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women portra@@ ys &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their sorrow over the women &apos;s mor@@ des in the country and in the region and show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; by cur@@ tly . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # wei@@ ght@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
a police commission@@ er said that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had become violent towards her .
since the end of their relationship there was some time past and the police said their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
when another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed up for mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , the display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez contributed nothing .
a few days later , the second woman withdraw@@ s her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women reimbur@@ se adver@@ ts at all , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit being victims of violence should report to the prosecution authorities at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contents 1 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strikes and statisti@@ c 2 invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ments and a legal system that lacks nothing sub@@ stan@@ ts@@ 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , inadequate implementation put@@ ts and statistics &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is difficult to find out how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , &quot; says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social science research facility in Paraguay . &quot; there are various reports and reports that do not even show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
the available figures , however , are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , there were 9@@ 600 ads on domestic violence in the District At@@ tor@@ ney Office . 70 % of these were violence against women .
86 % of the advertisements in the police came from women .
there were more than 5,000 ads due to domestic violence in the peace courts . here too , 86 % of women &apos;s ads arrived .
in the advertisements , 40 % of women said they were ab@@ used physically , 55 % of women spoke of mental mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s mini@@ stries Ana Bai@@ ardi , only a few of these crimes are actually displayed . &quot; 9 women who do not do so in Paraguay due to psychological abuse are reported to each woman in Paraguay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s suicide in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ence , the prosecution authorities cannot adequately document how many women are killed each year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country .
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies because of violence by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that does not under@@ mine
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted she called him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she gave up .
today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and is no longer associated with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognis@@ able :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never thought I would be a victim of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
once I read about it , I always thought that only women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on mal@@ treatment by Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote articles on Facebook in which she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos Himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she didn &apos;t like it so long and left him not earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner ab@@ used them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) consisting of women who are all victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the say@@ ings of women seriously .
in Victori@@ as case everything started with mental mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
her prosper@@ ous partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he started beating them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria &apos;s ads with the authorities remained without results and also from their relatives , they did not receive support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it led a trial against their former partner who developed into an im@@ penet@@ rable judicial battle between Paraguay and their home country , in which it was mainly money , power and influence of their former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a way of resist@@ ances and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was deb@@ ated in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # für@@ st ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ e@@ L@@ ess ) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law stipul@@ ates that Fem@@ izi@@ d should explain to an autonomous crime continu@@ ance and to punish harder as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
so the bill was changed in some respects to win the Euro MPs who feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alizing abor@@ tions would be banned , which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and sentenced to five years imprisonment .
the original bill had intended to pay the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that the victims of violence have to bear at present , if they just want to report an ad and would like to receive a secure accommodation to impose the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of inter @-@ human relationships .
a re@@ think must take place here , so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal .
whoever is silent in the face of these facts , complic@@ ates himself and contributes to the offen@@ ding of the perpetr@@ ators .
we must report such a long ad until mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is no longer considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law had been modified , including a passage called by partners in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation .
opinions on the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
however , the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is regarded as a great set@@ back .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; independent media in Oman one year after the ban of a newspaper continues to be attacked by attacks &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked by the Minister of Information on the website of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Korean authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for their reporting on corruption in the sul@@ tan@@ ate .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he is serving a one @-@ year custo@@ dial sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and brought to trial .
Oman has been governed since 1970 by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after completing his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
since then , alongside his role as the only sul@@ tan , he has held the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sultan &apos;s rule is characterized by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular domestic sec@@ rec@@ y , to restrict the public fre@@ edoms , including press freedom , and torture human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , from expressing their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in government agencies and institutions , both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closing and the imprisonment of three of her editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , in which since its inc@@ eption in 2007 , corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) has been reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor in chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested after an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties tie the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary &quot; on 26 July 2016 .
in the report , government officials were accused of pressur@@ ing judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to stand trial in an inheritance case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of 26 July 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties tie the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , Member of the Editorial Board , was invited by the ISS before the special department and was arrested by the security forces upon his arrival .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS had the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is &apos;s arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the paper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and distribution of the paper in any way , including online , is prohibited from August 9 , 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the trial was held in Mas@@ kat in the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and also ordered the final shut@@ down of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned , among other things , for distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the Internet , &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the state of the state . &quot;
in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of breach of publication ban and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of 3,000 Mark@@ an Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . moreover , a year @-@ long professional ban was imposed on both journalists .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine in the amount of $ 1000 ( $ 26@@ 00 ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information net on the dis@@ sem@@ ination of material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i a security deposit of 5,000 oms was established ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 prior to the pronoun@@ cement of the verdict .
the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j was sentenced to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after the imprisonment of his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he served his one @-@ year custo@@ dial sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n to resume , the newspaper continues to face attacks by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order to extend the closure of Az@@ am@@ n by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further instruction in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and in which the minister once again filed an appeal against the decision of the Appe@@ als Court to re @-@ launch the publication of the newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the paper are not the only cases in which the press freedom has recently been viol@@ ated in Oman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other violations include , for example , closing the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atine and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to susp@@ end its operation .
because of the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of journalist al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Korean authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press .
Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Korean authorities to :
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3. protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . under all circumstances to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have been able to exercise their lawful human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of re@@ pris@@ als , including judi@@ ci@@ ary har@@ ass@@ ment .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research on site : on the one hand , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and malaria have much more serious impact in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for resear@@ ching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
secondly , research carried out by African scientists is helping to build up its own research capacities in Africa . a major role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is the Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
in the 1990s he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic had first serious implications for national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a Post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the S@@ á@@ mi healthcare system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( Dis@@ cla@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GM ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : right now , the main focus of my work is on the application of research results . in doing so , I support the Serbian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
I am also star@@ ing a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant pathogens .
in your opinion , what are the most important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always stay bene@@ fici@@ aries instead of being a cre@@ ators ourselves .
the solutions we get are often not suitable for use in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use them here .
GM : where does the funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , as funding and development opportunities are better in other countries .
GM : what is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work you didn &apos;t have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special academic training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research into space , healthcare ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GV : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that pose challenges here .
the system means that magazines are only available for payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , which also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : how open source seed producers change global food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website of En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems around the world .
Frank Mor@@ ton has bred a salad in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties such as Out@@ red@@ Gor@@ geous , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question how many types of let@@ tu@@ ce it can get .
but at the beginning of the 2000 he re@@ marked that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it further for breeding .
the patents are not only for individual grades , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves .
over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as crop or cart@@ ons . as a result of this trend plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mor@@ ton always breeds salad , but he needs now longer since his work is increasingly ham@@ pered by more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if a b@@ oul@@ der is lying in a river that I have to pump up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do it now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that these patents go too far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when they stand trial , no one can breed a new type of salad because all the features are already patented . &quot;
however , it is very careful and stri@@ ves to use no material protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and anywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts from the ISS International Space Station have bred and eaten red skir@@ ts of the Out@@ red@@ Gor@@ geous species in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station , where it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open @-@ source seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
it was launched in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders .
in the context of the initiative , known as O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seeds they bred .
however , this does not mean that they can &apos;t continue doing business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders only allow others who purchase their seeds to breed their own varieties , and do not immediately cut out - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
ble@@ ak prospects
for the professor of the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control of seed and the opportunity to breed new plants is both important for food security and environmental protection .
seed plays a role in larger groups such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg points out that the &quot; open source &quot; movement is not concerned with genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented if vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed , &quot; he says and takes on the ever @-@ increasing mer@@ gers in the global agri@@ business , as it is offered on farmers markets , for example , that the way in which this vegetables is grown is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without a seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative agree to provide others with their seeds free of charge . in contrast , their approach is opposed to patent seed and plant traits .
photo of Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supplies is com@@ promised , as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always available .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all the anti@@ trust features are protected as intellectual property , which makes it difficult for plant breeders to be used either at all or even more difficult .
such estimates are not yet available for other plants , but experts such as Lu@@ by suggest that mass @-@ grown plants such as wheat are patented in an even bigger style than salad or car@@ rots .
a question of perspective
plants are grown in such a way that they exhibit specific desired traits - from such , through which their taste or colour improves through to those , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and endure threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant traits indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing through more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary at present than ever since the changed conditions are far more difficult to predict due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spe@@ aker C@@ arly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it does not contra@@ dict other breeders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and protection of plant varieties &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent exp@@ ires . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method .
thus , such protection does not hin@@ der innovation , but promotes it by making more material and know @-@ how available to the public . &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees it different : waiting for 20 years until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly no innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to grow plants that have been adapted to the changed conditions of the environment , you would have already lost the battle .
the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want farmers to make their work easier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us forward and it is impossible for us to continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all in all , Mor@@ ton interfer@@ es with the concept of pat@@ enting plant traits : &quot; we do not really create the features ourselves .
the plants form them themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ p , plant bree@@ der in the US state Oreg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; if you breed a variety , you also breed its own values into it .
anyone who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation is needed mass her@@ bi@@ cides , is breeding in its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is contrary to the contrary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such as are in international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , most smaller seed companies are able to survive without patents - either they reject the experiment or they keep it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case .

Mor@@ ton also believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding herbal patents : &quot; it looks like I &apos;m working with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent .
I constantly need new material for my catalogue , since I know that my opponents sell my varieties for a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent , one is protected from competition for 20 years , with which one makes it very simple in my opinion . &quot; worldwide feedback
although the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept now spreads quickly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , implements an open @-@ source seed program . to preserve the seed of traditional crops , the centre works with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organization Agre@@ co@@ l is working on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i commitment to breeders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( instructions for breeding differ from country to country , so the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot simply be adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able .
however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is at the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organisations and seed companies from all over East Africa gathered to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards patents on seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , explains that the organization is currently setting up a global alliance for open source seed systems for the planned next year of the official launch .
a consortium of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on E@@ rosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report . it believes that farmers have the opportunity to come to seed , exchange and improve seeds and shape seed policy in order to ensure a stable supply of food .
the report also highlights the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context that Lu@@ by of O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon recognize him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has largely paid attention to where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people realize that there is more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest cens@@ orship targets in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities are still blocking content on the Internet .
this time it hit the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of August 5th , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported the above .
in August , the Network published a comment on Facebook in which it sharply critici@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights information remains true to its goal to defend freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , to expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it has never been as important as it is now .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language issue of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network , based on alleged &quot; support for terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1st Human Rights Organization of the wave of web sites to victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arab language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the spread of columns and articles that he writes for non @-@ accessible websites and media for Egypt .
now the blog he set up to circum@@ vent the Egyptian government &apos;s cens@@ orship was the goal of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider for which Zi@@ adas blog is located , on the other hand , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 while he reported about the student protests and recorded a video how police exercised physical violence against two students .
his articles revol@@ ve mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him :
attempting to lock blo@@ gs is very old , but in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ atta@@ h al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and although the blocking of the blog may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) They have managed to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege ; arrest , attempted murder , sum@@ mons at the National Security Council , the blocking blo@@ gs as well as any other web site I worked for .
2 ) You proved that I did not write for nothing . in other words , my words have influence , even if only to a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post articles to avoid cens@@ orship .
but now , after they have locked it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave ones walk the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities closed up 133 pages from 24 May to 06 August 133 . this resulted in technical testing in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at .
w@@ af@@ te also documented the blocking of providers , through the circum@@ vention of inter@@ net@@ en@@ sage and private surfing possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12th we noticed how the blocking of web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer began .
such a practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users might have access to .
the situation is additionally exac@@ erb@@ ated by the fact that the decisions of cens@@ orship are being made behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population does not have a legal basis to take action against these acts .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

day after day newspapers in Brazil are reporting with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year old in school &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In the second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves predat@@ ory pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tim@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , na@@ vy and air@@ waves to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the violence threshold of 2017 in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which she announced to set up a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the newspaper explains the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in any major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . everything , however , devi@@ ates from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the heading &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : that is not normal !
this is the only alternative so that we , as journalists , do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ e@@ des , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper stated that this decision was not an occasion for pride but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war reputation in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war .
in the same video , a journalist writes that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the newspaper writes on :
we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to cover atro@@ cities of the police who first shoot and then ask questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it does ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues that violence as a &quot; war &quot; is argued .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of the military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ent neg@@ lect of public service .
remember : the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital .

according to C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia , &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil lie in the north and north @-@ east of the country according to the statistics of 2015 . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date data available .
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the mur@@ ders per state , Rio is in number 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
extra belongs to Glob@@ o , the largest media enterprise in South America , which , as C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia stresses , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years .
the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit imposed by the state of Rio in 2003 , was also part of these security policy measures .
in the beginning this led to a decline of violent deaths . for several years , however , the U@@ PP has been increasingly under fire after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities that should protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quoted from one of his articles in 2010 , explaining why the violence in Rio is not consistent with the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention on the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also involves serious consequences for people .
this requires the state to use resources and paths that are typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civilian is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost balls . &quot;
war going back or forth , the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio are still suffering .
it is a week ago that the police cleared the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ ar@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence this incident also made head@@ lines : a sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besieg@@ ed Syri@@ ans learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ c City
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace Organisation PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege in Damascus and surrounding countries , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib .
the Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 required the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are assuming that the Assad regime &apos;s massacre was perpet@@ rated on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations .
since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas have been under siege by rebel forces , leading to the fact that inhabitants are dependent on locally produced or through tunnels and control points of smu@@ g@@ gled foods .
through years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as how they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; life @-@ saving food source &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and run the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the traditional food @-@ based foods and are only rarely part of the Syrian kitchen . however , their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the right of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and wa@@ iters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been struggling for three years to make this project known and expressed its relief that it is now becoming more and more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more familiar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to earn money for the initiative , you can use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ fon@@ da .
it is planned to give 125 families knowledge to grow mushrooms , says Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around € 12,@@ 700 , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do by Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative relies on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
due to the shor@@ tages of fuel , locally produced plastic fuels are used to supply generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they started the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds originating in the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before veri@@ fying their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom grav@@ ey@@ ard in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a bigger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms throughout East Gh@@ out@@ a for free .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : break of siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new food source in the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food resi@@ dues ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc . ) for the production of new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities , who are tied to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea across the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege will become visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to be inspired by people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the 2017 fires
on the 21st of October several hundred people prot@@ ested in many district capital cities in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of the fires that were ramp@@ ant in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the government proclaimed a state shower last week from solidarity with the victims for three days .
bran@@ dies were also registered in the Gali@@ cian region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire bur@@ sts spreading in the northern and central regions of the country and reaching about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy oc@@ cured in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forest monitoring system , which monitors forest areas by satellite ima@@ gery alone , about 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the Lisbon area .
so that you can get a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
all Portugal burns in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ eri@@ an ) October 15th , 2017
some of Twitter users shared pictures :

numerous videos spread in the net and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the aim of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was not able to contain the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al of the government of the farmers of Portugal explained the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do it anywhere : there are dozens of open roads surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , building permits for locations with a high fire risk are questioned .
a wide @-@ reaching reform proposal introduced by the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 was obj@@ ected by the local authorities , who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a sl@@ ack@@ ening of the law that allowed construction activity if the applicant had a means of self @-@ defence - that was an open back door so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val explains in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of slightly flamm@@ able wood , are spreading , as in a vi@@ cious circle , after fires of this kind .
on these issues , the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15 and 16 , as inhabitants searched for information or tried to contact members , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they used their own civil protection data using the application fo@@ ve@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ gade and , at this fat@@ eful weekend in October , was so crucial that the servers were not able to withstand the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the site counted more than half a million hits .

in one night in the fall of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan by the Taliban commen@@ ced .
two years before , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups who had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan has become a country of terror and despair .
at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , sat in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner .
even though his mother didn &apos;t say it so at that time , she knew she would no longer see her son anymore - maybe even more .
in the morning , the boy was to break up .
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ le party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess .
the Taliban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came ever closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was hard and made him ill .
then he took what was left of his little reward , and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mort@@ ars which were heavier than himself to earn his living .
back then , as today , Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran were characterised by misery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , on which we also worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were no services and no heating there . we hung nylon against the open windows so that we weren &apos;t freezing at night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af made his life without papers in Iran behind him and ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous passage on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to help needy twice a day .
it is true that due to relatively high twin quot@@ as , Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers . however , it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers find in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
the Human Rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ qualified personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Italian law asylum seekers can only be allocated to a recording center if they have officially filed an application for asylum - which can be withdrawn for months after the registration of the asylum application .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation are either dependent on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his irre@@ pres@@ sible li@@ festy@@ les helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
having done various work in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af hid his entire savings in the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
it was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food snack .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now the subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film won the Venice City Award 2017 , which has been awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to in@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the road to other European countries .
in recent years , a number of Afgh@@ ans have ar@@ isen , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of its journey to Italy by the different Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes .
Afgh@@ an entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pa@@ du@@ a the restaurant peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome also represent Afgh@@ ans .
but A@@ shar@@ af@@ s goals go far beyond the Italian restaurant industry and retail , and aim back to the country that forced him to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where there is a risk , there are also possibilities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af also formul@@ ates plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end there is stability and prosperity .
now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on the way .
citizen &apos;s Report : Egypt &apos;s draft law permit the shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in prison .
he reported about the clearance of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , prot@@ esting against the removal of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen &apos;s Report is an international snapshot showing challenges , victories and emerging trends in global internet rights
the Egyptian parliament reviews a bill that fores@@ ees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government authority .
users would have to register in order to use social networks within six months following the submission of the law on the authority &apos;s website stating their full name and their ID number .
those who miss this step could be sentenced to up to six months imprisonment or pen@@ alties of a pen@@ al payment .
the law , which was applied by sixty members of parliament , is currently awaiting the legislative and the constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another MP filed a legislative proposal in May to introduce tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the insul@@ t of the president or a high civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the legislation , such an act would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , as legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law is passed , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the convic@@ ted .
in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years anyway .
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) on 13 August 2013 when he captured Egyptian police officers , demonstrating violence against prot@@ esters who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the im@@ pe@@ ach@@ ment of elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , like more than 700 protest participants arrested at the same incident , four years in jail for a trial date .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed on 20 May , because the prison leadership failed to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room , according to human rights groups .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , apparent contamination of e.g. arms , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iza denied the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were accused of reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si sitting block on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ vi@@ ya Square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pun@@ ishments of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested at the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
interro@@ g@@ ating Tunisi@@ an activists on verified documents
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours hearing the interro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly interro@@ gated by the President of the Republic who , according to the plan , explicitly backed a controversial draft bill that would ensure business people and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption acc@@ using Official Am@@ nesty , provided they return all illeg@@ ally preserved funds .
this document , published on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at on 21 April , sheds light on how the Pres@@ idential plans are to support the legal situation .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nam@@ ing of his sources by stating articles 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press code , which journalists have the right to protect their sources .
in spite of this , he appeared in the County Court in Tunis on May 9 as a witness .
does China want to force the users of social media to show their identity ?
according to new rules by the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need a permit before they write or share messages in social media .
in the provisions , it is also stated that registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts assume that this will allow the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks . it is up to now unclear how the authorities will apply these provisions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese network citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging App We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register with the state government as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organizer of information distribution &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this term is part of a 2014 law , thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that provide the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing contents and forcing them on request to susp@@ end user data .
these websites currently include web sites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ isse@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court has locking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court had the Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the data that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication announced that the site was blocked because it was &quot; an information source that collabor@@ ates with groups to support a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website . it is thus , among other things , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
Britain may not stop snor@@ ting
after this week si@@ ghted documents , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor real @-@ time communications and install malware programs that de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services on the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
despite all this , the consultation continues until the 19th of May . reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .

we , the members of the Chinese LG@@ BT@@ Q community , stand side by side with the victims of the tragedy and their families and loved ones and with all members of the worldwide LG@@ BT@@ Q community .
we are mour@@ ning together with them for the loss of so many innocent lives and condemn terrorism as well as all other forms of violence that are committed to human beings because of their sexu@@ ality , gender identity , and expression of sex . in China , violence relies on sexu@@ ality , gender identity , and expression of sex everyday , for example through bul@@ lying of LG@@ BT@@ Q teenagers in schools , generally discri@@ min@@ atory treatment and in the application of therapies aimed at &apos; healing &apos; gay and bis@@ exual people .
Blu@@ ed , China &apos;s most popular dating app for homosexu@@ als , changed its charging screen , which now shows the words &quot; we stood with Orlando &quot; ( about : side by side with Orlando ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the LG@@ BT community is part of the great family of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will win this war through love , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the founder of Blu@@ ed on his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wei@@ bo @-@ Account &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dozens of people gathered in Hong Kong on Monday evening to commemor@@ ate the assass@@ ination attempt .
