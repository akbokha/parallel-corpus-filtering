<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and operated his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist, mainly because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, uncovered the murderous plot of an oil magnate who wanted to occupy the highest federal court with judges who were willing to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free to Method Man," "" "I was as if that was the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the US had only intensified.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "I always said," "" "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very fanatical love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then came Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops in his mind behind the mountain, as you say so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague put it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, the people responded to his statements and voted in pairs for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won during the Republican elections was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever reached.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigot person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I had met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism programme that records people from all over the world, a deep faith man with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">He did not agree with Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I had met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at play.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fights the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me get used to the complexity of American life with much patience and grace and my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wiser advice helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump took his way to the nominated Republican presidential candidate, they offered me a hold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly White, gave the presidency to a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt for non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for trump because they either shared his racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook those things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the platformer as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify people, one of my friends said, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful, suggesting an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, voted for trump because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, perhaps they wanted to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">But one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commentates on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks at those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (OB.): as much as "White against all the other ethnicities"; word game from white in allusion to the whites and whiplash, as the big Van Jones described, has just killed what America has made so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - what faith or background one may have, America is welcome everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its President, twice the son of a Kenyan whose story, as he says himself, would not be possible anywhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the choice of Donald Trump, however, a huge part of the white American continent promises this promise and says: to hell with multiplicity, freedom of religion and the whole notion of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all this, I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" Mr. Khan asked.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd responded with a loud" "" "no!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "" "" "would Muslims have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "the crowd roared." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they answered." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried and their voices louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "would anyone who is not like you should have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and vocal" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded by saying: "thank God, Mr. Trump, that's not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country, for which his son had fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "this is now" "" "the land" "", "the message said." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, couldn't find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="66">From the misery to the stars: these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rubbish</seg>
<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican Music School of the Vicente Guerrero community in the Oaxaca province shared with the children of the Paraguaan city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">The music played at both locations has not only changed the lives of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill site, only 16 kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town, which is very popular with tourists, but worlds apart from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now, La banda de Música (music bande) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome poverty around them with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, located in one of the poorest provinces in Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and bande violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and gave the youth a rare hope of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come out of school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">You will always laugh and play with shiny eyes and play in the whirlwind you learn to play trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, horn, drums, bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura - a village that is practically located at the top of the largest landfill site of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprocessed instruments consisting of local solid waste materials produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under the direction of Favio Chávez have begun to turn parts of the waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments mimic violins, violas, cellos, contrabass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums, all of which were made of the rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music from the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra and so on.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article by the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult, because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in garbage The children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a trash produced from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments made of reprocessed material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentary called" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "(Harmonic Waste Management) records the musical performance:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates approximately one billion tons of trash every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like the people of Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries demonstrate how technology and teamwork are able to fight illegal fishing successfully</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports on international, practical solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices to share content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia, before it visited the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a bill of law of this species on its coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comores, Mozambique and the Seychelles were rapidly mobilizing against the ship. they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything," "" "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fisheries authority." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region: he was unable to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for looting the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (stop illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network, besides Somalia and Madagascar, are the six countries that had driven the prime minister out of their waters at that time.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and help each other where it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides technical support for FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to detect. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">The deliberate disregard of existing laws, through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, can damage ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were hampered by bureaucratic hurdles, and also by the snail's empo, with the information between individual countries, the actions are happening in real time in real time, with traceability to the FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news on suspicious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i is also very attentive to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas. also, suspicious routes can be discovered - such as those that suggest that a ship charges its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license, where they were on the go and possibly if they have a criminal code.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can, based on this information, refuse to accept such vessels in their ports. which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay punishments, as in the case of the Premier.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then there is considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that's what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, managing director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to regain a estimated $20 million in lost revenue, which the eight members of the HISH-i network lose each year due to illegal fishermen entering East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish, which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include sailing under false flag, fake license papers, imagining imaginations, fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "systematically exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non-seamlessly organised control system," "" "says Long." "" "earlier a ship could fish illegally and a country could say" "" "You mustn't walk my harbour." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me" "". "" "" "and this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now, the closed front has been working.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 research of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It exposed criminal networks exposed to fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used multiple fraudulent identities and it has tracked and found escaping ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Because of its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international agency to fight crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over long distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us rather far into the networks of organised crime," "" "said Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that aims to help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps to track down the illegal vessels that they like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position," "" "says Duncan Copeland, head analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO who also deals with fisheries data and offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">For example, some of the ships switch off their automatic identification systems, which they cannot be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Therefore, Copeland helps build a system that connects different levels of information with each other. it aims to help FISH-i to find criminal acting ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oceana Marine Protection Agency: a platform that provides satellite data and can be viewed worldwide through the position of every single trackable ship.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who's doing - that simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on a global scale." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project in which a global system allows the pursuit of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities do not only detect criminals but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that formerly fished without licence and had hardly any consequences, now know they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i have reported a 33% increase in fishery turnover since fisher boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors found trawlers there on board, whose use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "Kiilu says." "" "several hundred million dollars are lost annually in West Africa by illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">In 2015, six countries joined together, the so-called West Africa Task Force. they too fight illegal fishing, according to the exact same model as FISH-i. "With certainty, the aim is to make even more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently FISH-i's youngest member state of Somalia was able to report his first major triumph: in October there was Greko 1, a ship sailing under false flag.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship has also penetrated into forbidden waters, reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "with the adoption of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "" "Bergh says." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special, collaborative approach to protecting the oceans really works across the oceans.

<seg id="153">Street movements in Venezuela appear to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the removal of President Nicolás Maduro.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on impeachment, the Venezuelans, in whose eyes the negotiations on the country's political and economic crisis fled to the void, met on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (for example: the relaying of Venezuela) both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - among others in the flat land area of Barinas, in the Andean regions of Mérida and Táchira, in the central north-lying federal state of Carabobo and on the Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country continues to deteriorate, which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezuelans by an acute lack of food and medicines.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition seen in the inauguration of the current president Nicolás Maduro the chance for a fundamental change; however, the reluctance of a re-election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, contributors to Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises the context of the government's decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">Within the framework of the social, political and economic crisis, in which inflation and profits are among the highest in the whole world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% to the end of the year) and in which a serious and far-reaching shortage of food and medicine exists, the referendum on impeachment for many as the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance called Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or shortly MUD (for example: round table of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together. in addition, a twelve-hour strike on the following day and a march to the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan government headquarters, were planned to continue on 3 November.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter as follows:</seg>

<seg id="176">On Twitter pictures are piling up of disputes, as well as reports of oppression and mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="177">Especially big waves struck the news of police repression in the centrally located town of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">There the protesters returned to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed advocates of the government.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they could safely leave the cathedral, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop police forces, including this woman in the state of Táchira:</seg>

<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic shows the amount of repression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the demand for a tenure procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 on Día a Día, an Argentinean news site.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old Luis Quijano was forced by his father to witness the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine city of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As a grown-up man, Quijano now said in the context of the great La Perla-Ribera process in the province Córdoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial ended on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he retained the family secret for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I believed that it was all right.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years of age, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time, I could not see that my father was a thief, a torturer and a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis Alberto Quijano was a police officer. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was deputy commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in La Perla prison.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Archive recording.</seg>
<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor who was accused of kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10 year old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quianos's son, a man who in the course of the years recognized the extent of atrocities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a federal court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power a parent has about his child and how this child chose a way of salvation.</seg>
<seg id="215">From sports hall to military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">Everybody called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend.</seg>

<seg id="287">We weren't poor, but he still brought clothes to home.</seg>
<seg id="288">At that time, the defense accused me of being a conspirator of this crime. I answered, no problem, they could burden me what they wanted.</seg>

<seg id="350">Adaptation of Joshua Levine's original photos, widely shared in social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The error was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun, which is to be released in Kyoto, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "" "" "how could there be such an English translation?" ""</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation corrected.</seg>

<seg id="356">"" "the faulty English translation was first removed. the term" "" "terrible drivers" "" "was later replaced by the more appropriate, albeit grammatically correct term" "" "elder drivers" "" "(German:" "" "older drivers" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of Kyoto Prefecture are sorry for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already included in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for their accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger told us about the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we sincerely regret that elderly people felt offended by insufficient corrections (the translation) on our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>

<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "awful" "" "has been denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of elderly drivers who are involved in accidents throughout the country is a cause of concern." ""</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translate, you need two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators in the target language should not be in the original language - native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ English as their mother tongue to translate the translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost-determining or the relatively low number of English native speakers that learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that do not have foreign employees themselves can produce translations internally. then, the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confused and puzzling sentences that arise from machine translations show that this technique can't replace a human translator for a long time. this is particularly true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest British formulations in Japan, including enigmatic prints, often embellish t-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr users Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery. but from large companies or government who have the means to ensure higher standards, we can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more reputable source for their translations.</seg>
<seg id="390">Venezuela: protest and censorship in the Internet and television</seg>
<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "Naval con Libertad" (Free surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users announced that they had no access to the online broadcaster Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the internet presentations of VPITV and El Capitolio TV are no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online channels also transmitted recordings of the protests in Caracas, organized by opposition groups, resisting the government of Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began at the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court disbanded Parliament and handed over the tasks of parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroute. he pointed out that the connection was overlapped and recommended users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Zensur: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that the Venezuelan Internet sites are re-locked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the page of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offerings such as Vivoplay are popular among the Venezolans with Internet access, especially in periods of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been reluctant since 2014 to report protests. at that time, the Commission for Telecommunication threatened them with fines and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as a "call to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels I registered at @ vivoplaynet again.</seg>
<seg id="403">It is surprising that it is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfilov later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible by blocking the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online channels.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, has shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server answers incorrect or refuses to request such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">For VPITV, a third channel, the transmission was suspended on Thursday, 6 April, when the VPITV camera operator Elvis Flores, who carried out the protests in Caracas live, was detained.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on show again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it has also been reported that the government regulates the Internet connections: this makes the Venezuelans access to multimedia coverage of the current events in the country more and more difficult.</seg>

<seg id="413">Tina Alvarenga was a child of Criadita as a child. now she visits the house where she worked for years.</seg>
<seg id="414">Today Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collects testimonies from other crimes, just as they were victims of abuse and discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="415">Photo by Cecilia Rojas. use courtesy of curly.</seg>
<seg id="416">The following article is the shortened version of a landmark report published by Global Voices with kind permission of the authors.</seg>
<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen" ("Flying Cows, Promised Schools") edited and republished by Global Voices Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation from the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house spoke of pride about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "the one from which something has become," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old she began to work as Criadita for the family. as Criaditas, in Paraguay there are more than 46,000 boys and girls forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is very simple: a big family with little money leaves her minor son or her minor daughter to another, richer family. in exchange, the child gets food, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">But what is not mentioned here is that the children have to do countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all that within the framework of a contract which cannot be abolished.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice referred to as criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After completing her studies, Alvarenga worked for a number of years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls were affected by the practice of the Criadazgo - collecting testimonies, researching and denouncing.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call things by name, because the feeling of gratitude which is inoculated to the Criaditas generally guarantees silence.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, it is the family that gives their daughter in the belief that they complete their education, improve their position in society and "make something out of themselves" to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family that assimilates the girl and justifies its exploitation with faith means giving someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and maybe even starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The Victims of Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is mistreated, his family will learn about it until many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they even never find out about it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016, the relatively unknown phenomenon occurring in the hidden in Paraguayan households was seen as a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín entered the hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed traces of violent blows. shortly afterwards she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military unit Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the local population office.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived with them in their home in Vaquería, a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016 Ferreira took a stick to Marín until she suffered fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later, the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela blamed the practice of Criadazgo deeply rooted in the Paraguayan society for the girl's death.</seg>
<seg id="445">"" "they described the Criadazgo as" "" "a modern form of slavery" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="446">"" "several dozen people came to protest demonstrations and demanded that there was" "" "no further Carolina" "" "in Paraguay." ""</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely used in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay more cows are registered as children," complained Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without official documents it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The couple's neighbours and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a quick enquiry into the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes to court, the case of Carolina Marín could be pioneering - for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Criadazgo comes to court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criaditas are not only exploited as workers, they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, in which her father worked, had to register bankruptcy and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to work all and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital Asunción as Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="460">In her employer's house, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to divide the time in such a way that she was still time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood at five o'clock every morning and prepared breakfast for her employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">For example, it cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>

<seg id="504">"" "" "" "on the basis of the law, a job would then be set up to give citizens permission to use social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with the adoption of the law, users must be registered on the site with their correct names and ID card numbers to be able to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do so, it could result in a penalty of up to six months imprisonment or a fines of money.</seg>
<seg id="507">The draft law, which consists of six paragraphs and curses in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "any application that runs and is used over the Internet to communicate with others by voice, video directing and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities want to impose the registration. it is not clear how they should account for those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is not currently able to ensure the regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>

<seg id="524">This article by Todd Reubold was published in the original on Ensia.com, a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions.</seg>
<seg id="525">High up in the Kurdistan region in the north-east of Iraq, the animal protector Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists of the non-governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghostly Persian leopard.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subtype of the larger family of leopards, which roams through Africa and Asia, belongs to the Persian leopards (Panthera Pardus Saxicolor). altogether, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this certain kind of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"" "as Raza shows in the video," "" "The Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" "" "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem is also dependent on the existence of a large predator." ""</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard in the wild is low and goes against zero. when the team in the video therefore states that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a trained biologist, Raza is passionate about a different side of her country, which consists not only of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies on wildlife and educational programs for Nature Iraq for six years now.</seg>
<seg id="532">Since 2013, it has also been a member of the IUCN / SSC Cat Specialist Group and is committed to establishing protected areas for wild animals in the Kurdistan region.</seg>

<seg id="534">His works have been published in numerous international publications including TIME, Sunday Times Magazine, FT Magazine, Washington Post and The New York Times.</seg>
<seg id="535">Meyer has made films for National Geographic, PBS, CNN and HBO.</seg>

<seg id="538">Six years after the tsunami: the state of things in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School on Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed on 11 March 2011 by the tsunami and still the region is busy rebuilding.</seg>

<seg id="544">At the beginning of March 2017, Kahoku Shimpo, the left-wing daily Kahoku Shimpo, documented the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple catastrophe" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atomic disaster in Fukushima caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which lies in the Prefecture of Miyagi. Miyagi prefecture was a state prefecture in Japan's north-east, which had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated by sevens, because the tsunami had let whole coastal cities disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, the prefecture of Fukushima had a nuclear accident, already alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows from a local point of view what progress has been achieved six years later to rebuild the life of the local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority and survey results of the patients themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The residential building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned surrogate houses (for the most common, seasonal, saigai kouk juchaku) were finished in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was the biggest success among the three prefectures, and 80 per cent of the planned spare homes were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima forms the final light at 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">However, even six years after the disaster, it is still hard to relocate into final replacement houses six years after the disaster, evacuated by accommodation shelters.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 still 36,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuees from Fukushima still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful at this point. more than 75 percent of the evacuees, who cut their homes after disaster, were moved to final homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the number here is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The status of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper was able to determine, 1074 of 1100 schools affected by accident have opened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 per cent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing harbours have resumed their operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident have deeply affected agricultural land in the three prefectures of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi recovered 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of the farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima again.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farmland of Fukushima are located in the "nuclear barrier zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has largely recovered, but also here Fukushima remains far off.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only exhibit 75 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that since the disaster almost half of the inhabitants of the coast, it is more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to be able to determine the overall picture, the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuees.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of this article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about tsunami consciousness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of the respondents said that there was still not enough in regard to catastrophes prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it is about those who had to be evacuated from Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its edition of the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of evacuees from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima did not only have to witness the tremendous earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima Prefecture was also a witness to the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160,000 evacuees from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 there were over 23,000 people resettled back to Fukushima, in permanent replacement homes.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the stand of 2017 still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima live outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas most of the evacuees are older than 50 years old. they are known to retire right away because efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people come across from other countries that speak a different language, the differences seem to be greater than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often recognizes that one is more connected than it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global links are important as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices podcast, we look at these global links. in our Into the Deep Podcast we cover topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone about language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Tori Emanuman explains how a hike has strengthened her affection for Iranian culture; Violeta Camarasa talks about the time she worked with people from around the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences he collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="594">Reight: Mateus Ferreira da Silva in a widespread photo.</seg>
<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week to the intensive care unit: last Friday, a police officer had struck him with a baton against his head during a demonstration in Goiânia. nationally, millions of demonstrators took part in a protest march against austerity measures.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studied social sciences at the German University of Goiás, has suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated on him this Saturday and now transferred him to an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is regarded as critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local photo journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a hammer. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of Goiás have announced that Sampaio was suspended until the end of the investigation into the incident of the active ministry.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officer how he hits the face of the student Mateus Ferreira in Goiânia (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer was beaten by a demonstrator and landed on the intensive care unit, his face would be on TV for six months and the entire repression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Deseualizador," a media channel by media activists from Goiânia, shared the video recorded by Luiz da Luz in the network, where you can see how Mateus is attacked by the police officer and several paramedics hasten to him.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, but filmed from a different perspective, is also surfaced in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the clip shown below, you can see the attack on Mateus from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus living in another state, Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilians (about 2,700 euros) to cover part of the costs of medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in Goiânia while he is hospitalized.</seg>
<seg id="608">"be brave, Mateus.</seg>

<seg id="610">The drawing was shared several times in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="611">By: Heitor Vilela. release with permission.</seg>
<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Orellado recalls other acts of violence against activists in Goiás:</seg>
<seg id="613">Goiás has experienced a wave of political violence: here, the activist Guilerme Irish was killed by his father, because he undermined the Occupy movement in secondary schools. here, the military police of a WhatsApp group was killed, and here we have the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva who was attacked by a police officer who struck him with a baton.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police custody account</seg>
<seg id="615">Goiás was not the only state in Brazil in which it came to brutal police operations against demonstrators last Friday.</seg>
<seg id="616">Police officers were deployed in protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had set up a platform for speakers, rubber bullets and tear gas.</seg>
<seg id="617">The MEP Flavio Serafini, Socialist and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to refrain from speaking about violence against demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="618">This includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers in the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media have covered street protests by focusing on another unexpected protagonist: a window pane.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and Estado de São Paulo were specifically reporting a broken glass window to illustratively design their titles with a photo.</seg>
<seg id="621">On the other hand, O Globo favored a cover story with a bus set on fire.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible reason to report more about a broken window of windows than the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause.</seg>
<seg id="623">This must also be recognised if one is strictly against any form of material damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here, too, the term "vandalism" gets an absurd, disproportionate meaning, and the typical violence of the military police is covered by headlines with the title "protesters on confrontation with the police."</seg>
<seg id="625">Villages forgotten by the deindustralization of Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the Álvaro Reynoso law, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba closed their doors (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The local community Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is commonly known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill, notwithstanding that there is no appreciable sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralysed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After succumbing, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory lost its plants, until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other resigned and commuting daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran who opens every day at 4: 00 a.m., the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which have been put into operation after a long inactive period of time, because they have been preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene recalls to have heard that in Mañalich would be the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry has already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, the low market prices, inefficiency, bad management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for concern over the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are not news anymore.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the municipality saw already better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically obsolete, and hardly competitive they became unsustainable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories, the annual production goal was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for maximum 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugars must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report "Agricultural perspectives" issued by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations agricultural and food organisation.</seg>
<seg id="650">If present production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), raw sugar exports would generate around 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will surely go into history," "" "these were the first words of Cuban president Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the years that followed, the shutdown of a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received their full wages for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez was working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">"" "when Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, the word he repeated most is" "" "scam." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are in the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they constituted a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">The first letters began before the first anniversary year.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was a matter of officially authored documents that would be distinguished only with regard to the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on the responsibility was over and the letters became more and more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the shut down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in use," he assures.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, is waiting for retirement in another facility, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was against his will at the shutdown of the factory, in which he helped build.</seg>
<seg id="667">With each part he removed, he dismounted one of his 31 working years.</seg>
<seg id="668">The most developed industrial area in Cuba and the most important work degenerate was wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, no alternatives were created for the jobs and services generated in the communities in which they were located.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know whether during the Mammut speech of 21 October 2002, the then president in the eyes of those present, when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in use, everything would go well.</seg>
<seg id="671">The price of the population for closing the sugar cane factories</seg>
<seg id="672">Since 2004, sugar cane is only extracted high by grinding.</seg>
<seg id="673">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>

<seg id="675">When the sugar cane factory closed, or rather, when they began to deter them, they also stopped to pierce the road, and this also disadvantaged other establishments.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to look for other factories.</seg>

<seg id="690">A song from "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people from the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them. they do so with hip-hop, thanks to a series of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">Since 2014, as part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, workshops guide mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were conducted by educators David Hodges who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then collaborated with the Cree Hip-Hop group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop thus heightens the fact that the young participants explore topics such as "cultural identity, language, engagement, love, self-acceptance," or whatever comes into mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations Communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the tribe of the Kitsumales First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a road section in West Canada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">Most of the cases have not been clarified.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motive of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people did not always speak the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation recorded, the refrain is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved received some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars hip-hop group, who gave them a strophe in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the Strophe is available in transcription, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like no one ever cares for me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will hear our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we lost our way in life as a youth</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and go ahead as well as our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they intended for the Creator</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see some plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, close to the entrance to shokuhin sanpuru (for example, "Sculptural models of the dishes") are exhibited by each dish served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether they are entering or going on in the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the town of Kappabashi's tokier district there are a variety of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes that German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them. however, a new trend is now turning them into conspicuous cell phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in the special sale: new mobile phone tapes decorated with plastic dishes as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been converted to kitschy collections, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food orders is becoming increasingly more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, a kaisen-don (a popular bowl of seafood) was transformed into a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part of the exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of an increasing departure into the comical.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone stands and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, ikura or nitrous oxide is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there anyone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile with nitrous oxide?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appetizing form, for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile stand has the shape of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">There are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and handybands from dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Further quirky plastic dishes can be found at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow the hashtag # for the hashtag #.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origins of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry.</seg>

<seg id="749">In testimonials and foreign media about the notorious "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the despots and killed regularly appear only in statistics. however, they do not at all reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">Reporting on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, head of the sinaloa cartel, pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict perfectly into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident hardly anyone looks at the mourners or the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind every single ridge, behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never heal.</seg>
<seg id="753">That is why the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "learn to live with drug trafficking").</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime is not just a matter of fear of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much deeper.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole municipalities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video titled "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" (German: "how Fear Life Changed") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches secret tombs after his son every weekend.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews on just one day.</seg>
<seg id="762">"" "priests:" "" "as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today for the task that we have set ourselves to go and search for graves, according to the people we have loved." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="774">"" "" "" "we do not only have to show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and state leadership." ""</seg>

<seg id="779">I've known illness and sensationalism for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I pass every day to newspaper kiosks and see the front pages with images that can only come from a textbook for criminology or from experts from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of my composure.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can't be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10 year old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealer) when he is big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic deeds" of offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the inaction of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified by the fact that they were" "" "soaking up" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies when they do not stir and remain silent.</seg>

<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will be kidnapped or killed.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days whether crying would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article" "" "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation drawn by violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions such as: who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age whose parents care for them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and he tells him that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, cook potatoes, make tortillas warm and make "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottles of water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of age.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - inexpressible for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and he had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years before, when he saw only a few blocks from his home, the bloody body of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence by organised crime and the fight against it were mixed with the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Council's Council for Public Security and Government of the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor called 3103 murders. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 killings per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," in 2015, Animal Político has launched the data journalism project Narcodata whose objective is to portray the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking that has tormented the country over the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="819">But what is the year after something has appeared for the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photograph of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first release, it has been miserably used to depict tragedies that took place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling between picture and event - "wrong description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting of events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tank wagon crossed the place of Sange in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, tilted and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war Africa's second largest country had been neglected for years and thus devastated. the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of potholes that were difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tanker fell victim to that.</seg>
<seg id="828">Representatives of the authorities described a fireball, which enveloped dozens of houses including a cinema close by, which was full of people watching the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses burned and corppled corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to unrecognizability.</seg>
<seg id="831">"" "a picture with the title" "" "Das ist Nigeria" "". "by Imgur user Mystical Monkey, January 12, 2015.Several photos of the incident train the horrible scenes of this day." ""</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charred bodies that are lined up on the ground while people look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photograph was repeated several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and falsely attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What and what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the remote nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically the atrocities they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned and dead bodies were in the streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">Reports were reported, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one left to count corpses," "" "said a citizen of Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only by way of satellite images, the following time could be depicted.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between military Nigerian and the attempt of the Boko Haram to win country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerged from the Democratic Republic of Congo as it was wrongly presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this misuse of the picture from DR Congo is only one in a number of abortions; Africa Check has documented regulations in Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the picture was presented as a proof of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further, personal comments, such as this example, falsely relate the image from the Democratic Republic of Congo to sources of mass media in order to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Sange also appeared in connection with the fatal prosecution of the Rohingya Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a lightning report published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee were able to flee, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported from the violence against Rohingya, posts like the following arose who brought these descriptions together with photos from the Democratic Republic of Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture originates from an Saudi Arabian news page, falsely claiming to be the President of Myanmar's Thein Being. monks and politicians allegedly participated in the murder of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from DR Congo to depict this information.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong subjects or frames that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used for greater discussions about the silence related to the killings of Christians by Muslims or - to the defense of the Muslims - the killings of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is underrated compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is both important, so it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question, however, is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media there are tens of people who inadvertently share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggests this mood of misinformation and misinformation that actual atrocities are untrue and detours the actual horror of what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The dissemination of violent images has already been extensively debated (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that the restraint of images of refusal is equivalent to acknowledging the tragedy. sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images are desensitized by readers and viewers and the ability to empathise empathy (such as this study, which investigated how violent media act on helping others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss about violent portrayals in the news media, the fact is that they are indispensable for today's news coverage.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think carefully about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which, however, can also be used by the context or completely improper way.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, any examination of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e.g. confusing) strives to offer language enthusiasts a choice of words from around the world that are difficult or not at all to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">There are such words in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these confusing words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese saudade) and others deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist obstinate any attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or an expression is not enough, which is why a complete explanation and sometimes some context is needed to understand exactly what is meant with this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist from "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">For example, in the blog you can find words from Vanuatu-clap language, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "" "" "vakasteglok" "" "- Praise for your parents in recognition of how they have endeavored to you in your younger years." ""</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsung language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The laziness or laziness that one feels after getting warmed in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They defuse other cultures, reveal other thoughts and arouse our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze and classify the world around us and classify the linguists on this page even more of these "confusing" words and show how different, valuable and impressively these small languages are.</seg>

<seg id="973">More than 400,000 people have been affected since last Friday (26 May) and approximately 100,000 people have been brought to 304 safe locations.</seg>
<seg id="974">The rainfalls were closed on Saturday (May 27), and the water levels in some areas slowly declined.</seg>
<seg id="975">The health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still inaccessible areas.</seg>

<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves with being a Muslim in different ways. but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim-drawer.</seg>

<seg id="1130">We all need to ask ourselves why?</seg>
<seg id="1131">Why do I tell this here at this TEDx Talk 2017 in Stanford, where Edward Said, the man who showed us how wars are waged and included people by creating the "other" in the public presentation, was even more scientific from Stanford four decades ago.</seg>
<seg id="1132">We have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions to solidify the "other" as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women's March because the occupation means that we have a new future where we do not have a president who bombs chocolate cake while he already bombed countries and "to others made" people, goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1135">Story telling, by Flickr users Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to get in touch with someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), telling stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the confusing blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to obtain and appreciate the linguistic diversity of big cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS has held events since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">The following applies to the creators of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that embrace diversity - secure spaces where inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to belong to.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening" "" "is often associated with understanding," "" "these events are instead" "" "listening to appreciate, feeling, socializing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers must first introduce and translate their story in their own language or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even though the participants are not a professional storyteller, their devotion and representation lead to the fact that the audience gets involved.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso that is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate also seizes the opportunity to explain the customs of storytelling typical of her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamara tells the tale of the hare and the baboo in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the meaning of his fable, John Nyamusara asks: "how is this to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" he shares his feeling of inclusiveness with a broad smile:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened to it!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. all who are inspired by the project can come into contact with TLS in order to organize their own storytelling performances.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounts to 72 million US dollars, various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017; the March started at the puertoriental Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juan.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (civic front for the neural verification of debts) and the East-Comedy church meeting in Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates for reestablishing the debt also submitted a petition to the official home page of the White House of the United States.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartouil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and remind the contributions he has done for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture that is hosted in Berlin, an event dedicated to the # FreeBel campaign was dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the France-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, a publishing house produced by so-called 'Book Sprints', read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a Collective Research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which was published last year, is royalty-free, contains a series of articles dealing with the free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements need to be built for free knowledge and what the real costs are associated with.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense of our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartouil, the beloved and celebrated internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was stricken out of the directory of the Adra prison where he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">We have since then no information about his current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective Remembrance gives his friends and family a voice that pushes for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom, right away.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have let us start thinking about their own destinies, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of occasionally extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution to an unknown place.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "military police" Bassel had taken on the basis of an "strictly secret" command of the military court from his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by people on November 12, 2015, who were self-insiders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">However, his whereabouts remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basle's cultural prototypes was more foresighted than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the world's most important archaeological sites, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations, merging Greek-Roman architectural styles with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time Bassel could not know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would make everything possible to wipe out this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Syria but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into the digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule, which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not finish this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in jail:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent all my life in dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought English to me even when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with anyone who has asked. he has taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use computers as well as smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He taught me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a prodigal which she wrote to her husband in 2012-2015 when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together on the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available royalty-free.</seg>

<seg id="1248">Since the beginning of the 2011 protests against the Bashar al-Assad regime, more than 65,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights).</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">According to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International, at least 17,723 Syrians have died in prison until 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mozambique: back to previous post due to corruption convicted director</seg>
<seg id="1255">"" "" "" "Mozambique reacted with anger on a corruption case where a member of the government returned after half his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus where corruption was committed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1256">It is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years imprisonment in 2010, together with four other accused due to scattering 54 million Metikal (some 800 000 Euros).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds of the airports of Mozambique, the Council of which Cambaza ruled between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for his re-adjustment to the company, which happened on April 19 then.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which evaluated the motion, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to resume his old post as the company did not undertake any disciplinary proceedings after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not call this action good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">In an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, CIP) condemned the company's decision to re-establish the Director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a regression regarding the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company should have initiated a disciplinary action against the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company apparently remained silent and did not induce appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the social media, also rejects this behaviour and considers the case as "disguised":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent type, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had been shut down.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could give paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish up his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has consented to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza likes to be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Repulsive!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says, the director doesn't have any morals:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insults him and I can't believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that the state has already mistreated so massively.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is not wanting to return to the state and to serve the state * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but has instead served itself only by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself was tired of this man who was charged and ultimately sentenced to a long sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">To be honest, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, that a thief is in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison Samora Machel and will not only be remembered as the first independent president for the Muslims, but also as a sharp, one-edged and - by the way - prophetic speakers.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral accounts was when he confirmed vigorously that "an ambitious person is capable of everything, including the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest to sell."</seg>
<seg id="1279">"" "Samora also said:" "" "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that it is not that way. he changes tactics, but he doesn't turn away from his ambitions." ""</seg>
<seg id="1280">"" "an ambitious person is criminal at the same time." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter, the reactions were also negative:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison; he was 10 years away and released.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the network because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or are generally used as adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censors the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or" "" "(in Burma" "" ") as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma within the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalistic movements has given the word an extremely disparate connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even posts in which they have discussed the use of the word have been censored for their use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Furthermore, there are several Burmese words with fundamentally different meanings which have the same sequence of letters as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, stool is written in Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae', 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Faceboobutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A mail from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty way, whether they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The phrase ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question word (la) in Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were several reactions to Facebook's initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hands believes that it will reduce the hate language of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook ought to be more analytic before all the posts are suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you are writing on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the adjacent words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (donkeys).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists who spread hate language have received quite a good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action might send a strong signal to all that hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby users of social networks will simply start using a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">Author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to erase his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned by the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I drew attention to this new Facebook directive, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my mail was removed from Facebook and I was banned from posting, posting and sharing content 24 hours because the post "did not meet the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example, the Burmese Internet community asking for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intention to decrease racism in Burma from its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "in addition, it seems as if they have begun without a local context or technical support and have banned words like" "" "stool" "" "or" "" "pea curry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the fake posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they only have a little bit more respect for the 15 million benefits they give them a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">"" "" "" "Facebooks" "" "automatic censorship caused a lot of mockery among users." ""</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken off the web.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that didn't contain hate language but were still removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "the Burmese text is" "" "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian film." ""</seg>

<seg id="1336">Over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should also incite violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in the area of Rakhine, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">"" "" "" "Facebook has been criticised for its failure to take control of the impending hate speech on its Burmese pages." ""</seg>

<seg id="1343">The child marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the Parliament of the country unanimously approved a law that should forbid this practice, so that the age of marriage is now at 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Prior to this change of the law, some members of Hindu and Muslim religious communities held in practice, and in May 2016 there was a great public outcry. then, brother Harrypermalaja Maharaj, the leader of the various religious groups of the country, said that the state should not interfere, as that, age does not determine maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This happened regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago are a contracting partner of the UN Convention on Child Rights, which defines the minors as "every man under the age of 18."</seg>
<seg id="1347">The statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children, who had already been married to 15, was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tobago, and at 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the Federal Statistical Office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married in the year 1997-2007.</seg>

<seg id="1390">By clicking on websites, Turkish users can view Wikipedia's content again</seg>
<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia page was presented on January 18, 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright law in the United States, internationally darkened.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For more than a month Turkey has been blocking the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopaedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day, it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students as well as reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many technically experienced Internet users are used to using encryption tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the world's third-largest VPN prevalence), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia since 2008, as recently described in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blocking of the Internet has been taking place since 2007, after the Internet Law (No 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains blocked, several mirrors (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated) are now surfaced.</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform deposited all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its dedicated peer-to-peer network, which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">Despite the legal ban, the content is irrevocable.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the news (via the lock of Wikipedia), we put everything in place to take snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, there is the possibility to read the content in decentralized and distributed fashion.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansilic.org, a Mirrorseite of Wikipedia, as well WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar error pages, if Wikipedia is locked in the respective country.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member and staff at Mozilla with the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy-address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access a different URL that is not the original. that what you see then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server directs the request to the correct Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia, even if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">This is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo of Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with poorly positioned motives and well-balanced colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera with him and to try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Neptune fauna to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown, right next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to take photos that draw attention to Nepalese wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class situation helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live on the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that a leopard would be on the bank of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was in and I immediately started to kneel pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar seeks cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, for he was already faced with Tigers face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep while sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the King of the Bustan appeared. he immediately sat down, we see ourselves and he stares me through the scarf-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar places the logo "I click for conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepalese nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Ottern at the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version has been published here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women with greatest care avoid addressing the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "instead they use pronouns or say" "" "father of my child." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that they should respect the husband because of social pressure, as well as the fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm, keep this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian state of Odisha by a false court and infringed by her family and village community after she addressed a married family.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of naming their wives by name is also common among men. however, they have far fewer rights to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in Pune district, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel as well as housewives, joined a unique club and became the main conversation topic of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, it is part of the # KhelBadal campaign that is operated by the community of Video Volunteers and advocates the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pai has been working for seven years with her video camera to detect practices such as children's marriage up to the exile of HIV and AIDS infected, and leads these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It tells how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video showing Rohini in their discussion was about women who did not call their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem that women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to pronounce the names of their husbands out loud is a custom which they have all dutifully maintained and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is regarded as deceitful as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this round of discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name so far, wanted to try out at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband stayed long after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him by his name from now on.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started their first discussion club with this confidence in their luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection the women tried to get the discussion going with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to tell her husband's name with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then she asked everyone," "" "If we can't tell the names of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, does that mean they don't respect us?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equal?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"" "" "" "some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands on their lips," "" "said Rohini Pai from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the breaking of an age-old tradition in which married women can never pronounce the name of their husbands." ""</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she chained only in front of herself during the whole exercise; another decided to release the entire frustration caused by him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Even in the adrenaline rush about having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try at home to call their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the coming days Rohini received a number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said, "Rohini thought I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the hallmark red dot on the forehead that indicates the marriage status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only need to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"" "" "" "I said to my husband that I would carry the censor-red dot when he did it too." ""</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed and I stopped carrying him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely left off, but think they are now in a better position to choose for themselves not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make a trip with each discus club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear what," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">For the first time in their life they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang and talked about things that they had never thought of before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never been so honest about some things, such as our identities attached to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to the clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only borne saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most, this is okay, but some wanted to wear a Saline-Curta, a wide shirt over trousers, they didn't dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much debate and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code, the morality associated with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled their own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to go on a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will succeed.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether in the five months since its first discussion club has already changed, Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have done only small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped to say the name of their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, are still doing it, but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women are now wearing Zinnoberrot on their foreheads at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the haggling for more freedom of movement or their own dress code - lie at the end of a difficult-to-navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives everyone of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we're talking about and what we're doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping people for the organ trade, presumably for disbelief, concerns the police of Zambézia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometers from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was beheaded and some of the organs were taken.</seg>

<seg id="1589">According to local superstitions that the head of a bald man might contain gold or bring wealth, the police spokesman of Zambézia of the BBC stated.</seg>

<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized for liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for "Subversion" (state-endangering) after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto that calls for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China described Lius case as" "" "an internal matter" "" "and told a speaker that he considered it" "" "not required to discuss this matter with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China will continue to approve calls from the international community, the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or allow him to receive treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations, United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Liu to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway and Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brenden have refused to answer questions about the release of Lius.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway was staggering after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon voyage to China, as exports have been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope of unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to liberate Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for the release of Lius as she stated in a statement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to lift all the restrictions of Mr. Lius's wife and family members.</seg>

<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman for the US Embassy in China, Mary Bethpolley, announced on June 27 that the message told the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu but also to liberate his wife Liu Xia from house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "the US Embassy's request drew a furious response from China, with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that" "" "no country has the right to interfere and to make irresponsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Mr. Polley announced that China should offer to the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom, such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice, on which they are entitled according to the Chinese Constitution and the legal system and international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The US senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to push the Chinese government to unconditionally release Liu and his wife.</seg>

<seg id="1661">Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on July 7 and 8 at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources reported in Beijing of Reuters news agency that China had great concerns about whether the fuss about Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada and Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum asked China to provide Liu with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu's attorney told AFP previously that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to speak and contact with someone outside, including his lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues to tell:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"" "" "" "Canada urges China to uphold its international human rights commitments, including freedom of expression, and to release the rights to exercise these rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="1668">France and the United Kingdom</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Foreign Ministry urged China to release Liu on June 29 for humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs, irrespective of where. furthermore, his wife and his family are to have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the State Department announced that there is no further information on whether France will eventually receive it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan and Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of continental Affairs in Taiwan called on China on 27 June to release Liu and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislature Yu-Mei-nu from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual guide in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, expressed himself very apprehensive about Liu on 28 June and indicated that many asked him to pray for Liu well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt personally very moved and also encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens inspired by Liu Xiaobo, who signed Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Licence: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association, the Minister noted that many people were criticizing the dominance of Singapore's only political party, because Singapore compared Singapore to other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported that Singapore should be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "twist the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices, to create this precious country, one hears that we are ultimately not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of a flight from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you're not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other "normal countries," in view of this, he inevitably appeared undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core point of the subject, the good old lyre comes up from authoritarian rulers to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic, since it is better suited to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end the last week of Shanmugam gave answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He camouflaged the corresponding questions with non-answers of rational nature.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls Shanmugam to clarify his opinion since she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clarify this point as long as it was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By releasing his commentary on his blog, he points out to the critics that one should begin to read the full address of the conference so that the context of the statements of Shanmugam could be better understood, according to Singapore, a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore was more of a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the Singapore elections are so uneven, even if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said that Singapore was" "" "no country," "" "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who, as leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes that, properly associated and aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review decomposes the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "did Mr. Shanmugam" "" "commit a mistake" "" "or was it a Freudian speaker?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only considered as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, on which country are the sovereign rights of the city Singapore back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since it plays an important role within the government cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapur do their military service, they only defend their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who does our prime minister have to pay?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink staff card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">If the magazine Journey of a Decade belongs to Bejahung, Singapore is and has always been a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"" "" "" "I didn't say what I said..." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have angered many Singaporean...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"" "I can understand that we often hear statements such as" "" "the defence of the country above all" "", "etc., but that is not quite right." ""</seg>

<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know, there is little that Canadians differs from Americans.</seg>

<seg id="1768">First, being called "nice" means being diligent - like the good-natured, gentle but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from "The Simpsons" (which has its own Canadian double-gover).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada really is a nation full of people like Ned Flanders it would be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing you can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless means being unobtrusive and uninteresting and paying no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be a good thing if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, far away from the things that happen around you.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of the Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs.</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on April 19, 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org and is here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is run by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink glasses frame and gold coloured earrings in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">It is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2.50 per night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the antechamber there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - hundreds of African and Haitian migrants are coming here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, says Mrs. Ramírez, people come in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept outdoors on cardboard boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are ill, she buys them drugs that they can't afford, they massage them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mum Africa is an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>

<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister hoping to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move northwards.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that the Haitians and the Africans often travel together and that Africans already speak on Whatsapp from Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet had previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will contact Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave it again," "" "he answers, smiling." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells her guests often send their text messages when they are away to greet them or to tell her about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the propulsion of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"" "" "" "MS Ramírez is perhaps very well known, but it is not the only spark of hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula." ""</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city, a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have welcomed migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He started to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on ceilings on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking spot outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela declares that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I lived in the United States," "" "he says." "" "I have experienced what they experience." ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">"" "there are places where people help and others don't help. that's why I give them my support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants traveling through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova M. Meléndez told me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children, who wanted to extract money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for accommodation and an unknown, a single-parents, offered him their roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family is still living there and she tries to decide where to go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the tunnels, travellers should consult their phones quietly.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who went away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she performs in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair care, which she has made an art female, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>

<seg id="1958">"Ya ze fueron," she repeats every time. "you have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-in for personal communication devices in Xinjiang by Twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi received a cell phone notification in which they instruct the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the message it is said that the app will prevent" "" "preventing access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities have also used the app for more than combating terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because they had exchanged messages with a private WeChat group shortly after they had installed the app.</seg>
<seg id="1966">The police informed that the app was investigating and prosecuting the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "damaging information" including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangen's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a security service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is blocking pornographic web pages, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and to remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the minors for minors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While reports on digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, displaced ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and discontent in conflict areas, the authorities often associate extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The Twitter-based media outlet "Images from mainland China" (for example), published censored messages in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where policemen tested the inhabitants indiscriminately as to whether they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile message called for people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, you may be detained up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people to use devices intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the watchdog technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" are also published a Jingwang product description, indicating that the software can lift up the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal contents.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All governmental branches, authorities and institutions affiliated with the party, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office during the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report of Freedom House, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities issued a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi in order to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist" videos. however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis 3 million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a number of other possible offenses, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2063">Some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished, even though I had done nothing to earn this punishment.</seg>
<seg id="2064">In punishment in all their diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "he calls the affectionate" "" "confession" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2069">Give him the pleasure, you cannot measure yourself with him, and you cannot hold back your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My screams were not enough for him, which is why they exchanged the pipe with a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">During my first arrest, I asked myself if the investigator had previously worked as a waste collector or whether this was part of the normal work equipment.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had intertwined four cables to present us the great invention of a gigantic cable from their point of view.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within one hour three of them changed, while I was still on the line.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I stopped screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The executioner remarked the cooling and didn't take any pleasure in it, which is why he came next to an electrically charged rod.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Electricity flowed up my whole body, enough to supply my whole neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="2077">My half-naked body stretched out on the ground was the perfect conductor.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emballam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emballam Hdaib smoked a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emballam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he slumbers to his screen, sometimes to his computer, sometimes to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips moistened with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaibs family to flee from their village in Palestine where they lived as felahyeen (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years now, Hdaib has been a passionate activist opposing the conservative majority and questioning its tried-and-tested opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rape.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics such as orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the whole Arab world. all of these issues are not only relevant in his hometown of Amman relevance, but also in cities ranging from Damascus to Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited in his thinking and he can sympathise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not openly admit it, he has a special aversion against American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, have anything to do with his identity as "Palestinian refugees of the second generation."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think of my own circumstances," "" "said Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so, because I am a man," "" "while he poured in water-dissolved Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; at this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee in a sensing hot day has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically speaking the smog of lukewarm coffee and the wavds of the Kent-cigarette in the nose are primarily of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially when you look at the neighboring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan, to drink water - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, Jordan's Interior Ministry announced a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front-singer Hamed Sinno contradicts the country's cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concert statement.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the deputy and former spokeswoman in the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert had" "" "just" "" "cancelled because of the singer's sexual orientation." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which is questioning the well-tried legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">"" "in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila underestimated the Jordanian people as" "" "progressive supporters of human rights" "" "who continue to opt for an intellectual and cultural pluralism." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement might not be simply rhetoric but actually an increasingly clear emerging reality in Jordan which clearly appears in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib regained traditional gender standards by emitting his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In recent years the number of "honorary morals" has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch, according to Human Rights Watch, reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure to support the women victims of attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">"" "according to a law to fight crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of intra-family violence can" "" "be detained" "" "in jail for an indefinite period of time, and for their release it is often necessary for the family to do nothing." ""</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs Music enjoys great popularity and is known not to shy away from issues that have long been taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but acknowledges that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit allusions to sexuality, freedom and expression, not from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "politics failed me," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib attacks the question of Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and "Ghareeb," the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib released a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse repeats strikingly often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is it too." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get what you want "- be it faith or non-belief, heterogeneity or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, to note later that his comments were torn out of context, distorted and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but it was only a processed version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib openly advertises the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals is not contrary to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the 8th century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuvo, who was supposed to work on behalf of the caliph later, could openly write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, Hdaib, has nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the Hashemite Kingdom there is nothing new anymore that the government sanctifies attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service has arrested several former members of the government and members of the teacher association, with the grounds that they are critical to the problems related to corruption-rooted corruption in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, the Hdaibs concert is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">Jordan has denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that is Hdaib - consists of slow, thought-out and inner changes. it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also about" "" "experiencing them" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will come closer with music, art and literature from genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and democracies brought about by artificial methods. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time comes, Hdaib will continue to rap and consequently also resist.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman is a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warrior dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origins of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is thought that it is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in many areas of Tohokus in August. another theory states that the forts, drums and dancing were handed over over a thousand years and come from a period of time in which armies from west Japans marched into the Northeast to force the indigenous people of the region, the Emishi, to their knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab a few great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">You can hardly imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A joint centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been watching the Meguro Gajoen again for a long time: two fixed cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">But for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>

<seg id="2167">Outside appearance and care have rarely been as important as in this story, as they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from criminality and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima's capital - a region with a very high crime rate where street robbery and illegal drug trafficking are commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for esthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) have led to more and more normal citizens entering into the experienced hands of hairdressers that can recreate these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairdressers that go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity has even inspired an annual event, the Friseure competition "Batalla de Barberos," which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts are competing against each other to show who can create the most eccentric looks from them, as can be seen in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and instead of receiving a training in the hairdresser art, which enables them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a profession which is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops prior to the school year that began in March and reported some of its achievements:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995, we were the only school in the municipality and the district, which we are very proud of, because we have built up this educational community for the sake of love for the children.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the contribution" "" "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" "" "published by the international online magazine" "" "Tea After Twelve" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people whom we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important to meet people who feel burdened?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is precisely the question of the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the BogotArt Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Carta por la legliación (letters to reconciliation) that encouraged young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to this: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government closed a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary forces Colombia), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">Internationally, the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his services.</seg>
<seg id="2188">Before the Colombians, however, there is still a long way to speak of true reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrillas, who had lived in illegal camps for many years, were subjected to war rhetoric and carried their arms around the clock, must now integrate themselves into the lives of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society in turn, accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take it into its ranks and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians had to unite and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And they also did: until now, thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerilla fighters to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerilla fighter - to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the Campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letter to reconciliation emerged at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">He explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to tell us to share his love with people this year, who were most needed.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for ex-fighters of the FARC, who now have to find their place in society and build up a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace," she says.</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I never thought someone would be forgiven. '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation traveled to the camp to personally transfer the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC have set themselves up as they had done before, in order to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," said the political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the Province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I looked into one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down because next to him on the bed was a grenade launcher, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "yet I spoke to him and said," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he answered," "" "I answer a letter that someone has written to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "never before in my life someone has written something so beautiful, that's why I answer it." "" "suddenly tears ran across the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him and sat down beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of war, he was sorry to be all the years of the loyal companion of this combatant, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to protect him and his six brothers from starvation. "I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New Voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the beginning, students and some of the FARC leaders came together for a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as early as the war and the FARC was already in hiding.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state has affected the entire Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop into a political party, we can help shape society in this country more just.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a goal of this size, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," "" "one of them said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear those people who had never found any hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hate were only people with beautiful feelings turned around by their circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives is hurting me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - even those who have killed and caused so much harm, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the camp's commander in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">Colombianism was prophesied that peace would reign after disarming.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, famine and a lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to take up arms, stand up and protest for their rights. and that is also fully justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC are now putting on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call on all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and sacrifice, for we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will endure many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">There will be many obstacles along our path, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2245">But the threat that is related to a Damoklesschwert over the local LGBTQ community has not been created overnight.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a transsexual woman from Grozny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">The LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has captured international headlines several months ago, after reports have been published to address the deportation, torture and killing of queer men in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in the Novaya Gazeta, throwing a light on the methods of the Chechen authorities who arrested suspected queer men and put them into secret prisons in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a transwoman, was born in Grozny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">Since childhood she felt that she was actually a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When she grew up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, which is why she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of Chechens had learned about the gender equality of their landlady, the hunt for Sabrina was opened.</seg>
<seg id="2254">Out of fear of her life, she ultimately moved into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend from Dagestan, a woman who was in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took her without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While trying to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere on the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent her to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there are no males more in Chechnya who can eliminate this shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos of my documents took the lap through the whole WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015, I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was about to bring out a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying, "Here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I hurt.</seg>

<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and finally woke up in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had gotten everything together and started crying.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two stitches in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in what wings were you placed - in the men's or the women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, my male name is still on it, but the doctor understood and laid me for the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful to him for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I first read his name on his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for being respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">I got threats last February.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked to send me back to Chechnya to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They asked absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by walking up without the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official TV in Grozny and say that I had not changed my gender that everything was only bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have body size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people once spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "You have brought a monster to the world that has damaged not only your family, but the entire republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">It was too much for my mother and she laid a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time, I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later, under the window was a car with darkened windows and a license plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened the third time it became clear to me that something was lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends beat the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you escape?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons, I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help I left the country, but then something unbelievable happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registering, without notice, without notice.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"" "at the moment I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" "" "you don't believe you would be safe just because you left the country?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know in which hotel you are in. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it to you: it is number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">But we don't talk about gender equality, that's a taboo theme.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditionally Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I can't overcome this psychological barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with a camera, I actually do a lot of effort to look at the person they remember from their past - that is to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know anything about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who has imprisoned for one and a half months in arcane.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He said that during Ramadan, no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan was barely able to wait, and he did not lock out a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">With this I mean, they probably invite the relatives, they take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand a proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced through blood gratification.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there are just not many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, above all, those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to put themselves in the court of Kadyrow.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there, so that they can present them as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say," "" "Should they be killed, they will show their bodies on TV and claim they have attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply vanished, they were deliberately exposed to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is it just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was himself when these people were taken with him.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, but there have been no reports yet. however, we suspect that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already happened in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known in whole Grozny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when sharia was considered, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer at that time than it was now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia originally wanted to lead us to" "" "civilisation" "" "but finally dropped us back to the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had tinted eyelashes, wore tubes and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Health of Sharia has never just curbed a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew of it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"" "in the Chechen language there is a saying: Khardama Kharda. that is," "" "Don't talk about the misfortune of another." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to be children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never hunted and never defeated.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this time of grace hold?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to speak about morality in television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He spoke not about us per se, but primarily about the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless, one could feel how people began to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had laughed and laughed before looked at you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time, I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the republic worsened steadily.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what is your activity now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a sort of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teacreffs, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get food tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a cent for that.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I applauded breeding places.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidchab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is, it has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">That is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to know you with froth in front of the mouth, that there are no gays with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestan have those who have Kabardiner, the Russians also have; on the whole planet they exist - but not in Chechnya. "</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it's unpleasant for me to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think of transient to men who love men, and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that is a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different ways - two different ways of feeling to be exact, different attitudes of life.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me, it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I will be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all because I simply know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn of an increase of suicide within the impoverished Arab ancestor community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the indigenous Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Over the past few months, there has been a strong increase in suicide.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photograph of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-incineration of a man named Jassim Moramazi on 27 August remarked the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran that is shaped by poverty and unemployment, into the limelight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">He lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, inability to stand up for his family, so Ahwazi-human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had lighted himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take their lives.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family patriarchs who felt helpless and unable to feed their families and to pursue a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region in which a large part of the Arab ancestor community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to make a living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab ancestor was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and in 1925 took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran as well as some of the most profitable and most valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population receives little from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often the victim of untreated diseases, hunger and privations.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime has systematically refused the Ahwazi Arabs to work in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a large number of dams, the water from the Arab areas into the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are lying.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to exacerbating the devastation caused by drought and destroying local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab ahawks now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director of cooperatives, work and welfare, reported that 5% of the Ahwazis, who were looking for a job, completed primary school, completed 55% of a secondary school and completed 45% of a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"" "a" "" "systematic strategy" "" "aimed at crushing the spirit of national resistance" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist resident in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination," led to a "high rise" in the number of suicide among young Ahwazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">DoShimi said that unemployment has become worse recently. the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians emerging in Ahwaz and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since officials and institutions prefer not to recruit Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi will be deprived of access to employment opportunities across all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and compel them to earn their living outside their native land.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first and last name in order to hide their belonging to the Ahwazi and become so disguised, because even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi have to endure, human rights activists stir up the alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world awakens and takes notice thereof.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I don't identify myself with feminism, even with the intersectionals"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. released under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the website of Afroféminas. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - react with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well-thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all feminine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women nowadays still earn less money than men despite equal education.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms always make sure that women sooner or later come across a glass ceiling in various areas of life, and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and denominations.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I'm suffering double and triple.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, when I am talking about skin color, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or black women from the Diaspora; when I mention how we have always been misused in racial segregation and discrimination, both in and out of the feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists decide to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, they all agree that women - all women - should come together to "sing their voices and" Kumbaya, "to sing my Lord," in order to achieve equal rights (some) of the women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to say that in addition to sexualized violence there is an institutionalized form of racist-motivated violence, which we are exposed to black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background tend to be referred to school more often than white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all people of any skin color the same rights; on the other hand, as a black woman, I cannot join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands, who refuses to take into account inequalities in her mind, which relate to the sex as well as to the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "sojourner complained in her speech in 1851:" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I too refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical sense an alienated and marginalized being." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups who also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropriation in order to advance their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer seek to suggest white women the importance of overcutting skin color and gender. for some of them continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to teach them for the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different origins a home and distinguish themselves from white feminism, the word "feminism" is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to get rid of myself completely from feminism and join the movement of womanism that was called for my dark skin and status as a woman, rather than using myself for a white-feminist paradigm that is so obstinate that intersectionality is celebrated as a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before that we define black women to us according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clarka Hudson-Weems, author of the book Africana womanism: how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, mental, emotional, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can raise black women and women of other cultures, for in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my being.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment where my life is neither ignored nor ignored nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and edited version of the article "The Wave of Violence Against Women in Paraguay" by curtly. the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# weighteinefraubin), which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner said that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner, who had become violent towards her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship there was some time past and the police said their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman Balbuena showed up for mistreatment, the display of Ada Báez contributed nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman withdraws her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women reimburse adverts at all, they generally do not receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit being victims of violence should report to the prosecution authorities at all.</seg>
<seg id="2489">"" "" "" "contents 1" "" "strikes and statistic 2 invisible mistreatments and a legal system that lacks nothing substants3 Paraguays laws: good approach, inadequate implementation putts and statistics" ""</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is difficult to find out how many women are really mistreated, "says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social science research facility in Paraguay." there are various reports and reports that do not even show the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay, "she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">The available figures, however, are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, there were 9600 ads on domestic violence in the District Attorney Office. 70% of these were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the advertisements in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5,000 ads due to domestic violence in the peace courts. here too, 86% of women's ads arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the advertisements, 40% of women said they were abused physically, 55% of women spoke of mental mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan women's ministries Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually displayed. "9 women who do not do so in Paraguay due to psychological abuse are reported to each woman in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "two women who do not do this," "" "she explained at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's suicide in Paraguay is not a criminal offence, the prosecution authorities cannot adequately document how many women are killed each year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women's murder in the country.</seg>

<seg id="2506">In the beginning she didn't want to do that, but then she gave up.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana is 28 years old and is no longer associated with Carlos. but for two years she endured psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognisable:</seg>

<seg id="2509">Once I read about it, I always thought that only women who are too subservient because they are deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on maltreatment by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming names, she wrote articles on Facebook in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos Himself. he asked rhetorically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she didn't like it so long and left him not earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner abused them.</seg>

<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill was debated in the Paraguayan parliament, which was known under the hashtag # PorEllas (# fürst).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# NoneLess) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law stipulates that Femizid should explain to an autonomous crime continuance and to punish harder as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">So the bill was changed in some respects to win the Euro MPs who feared that the way for decriminalizing abortions would be banned, which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and sentenced to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill had intended to pay the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs that the victims of violence have to bear at present, if they just want to report an ad and would like to receive a secure accommodation to impose the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as part of inter-human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">A rethink must take place here, so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Whoever is silent in the face of these facts, complicates himself and contributes to the offending of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We must report such a long ad until mistreatment is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was adopted in the Paraguayan Senate. previously, parts of the law had been modified, including a passage called by partners in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="2540">Opinions on the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack his victim again.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research on site: on the one hand, there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have much more serious impact in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for researching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research carried out by African scientists is helping to build up its own research capacities in Africa. a major role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is the Director of the Centre for Infectious Diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">In the 1990s he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic had first serious implications for national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a Postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the Sámi healthcare system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GM): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: right now, the main focus of my work is on the application of research results. in doing so, I support the Serbian national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">I am also staring a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">In your opinion, what are the most important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always stay beneficiaries instead of being a creators ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not suitable for use in our environment, and sometimes it is impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GM: where does the funding and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, as funding and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GM: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What are the obstacles in your routine research work you didn't have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on, and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special academic training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, research into space, healthcare (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often it is the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that pose challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system means that magazines are only available for payment (the so-called "Paywall"), which also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how open source seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website of Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has bred a salad in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties such as OutredGorgeous, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by its own ingenuity and the question how many types of lettuce it can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he remarked that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it further for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only for individual grades, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or crimped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as crop or cartons. as a result of this trend plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton always breeds salad, but he needs now longer since his work is increasingly hampered by more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is as if a boulder is lying in a river that I have to pump up." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do it now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think that these patents go too far." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And when they stand trial, no one can breed a new type of salad because all the features are already patented. "</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and strives to use no material protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and anywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts from the ISS International Space Station have bred and eaten red skirts of the OutredGorgeous species in the "greenhouse" of the station, where it is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for open-source seed) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">In the context of the initiative, known as Ossi, US breeders can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seeds they bred.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they can't continue doing business with their seed and sell it. "open source" breeders only allow others who purchase their seeds to breed their own varieties, and do not immediately cut out - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Bleak prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control of seed and the opportunity to breed new plants is both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seed plays a role in larger groups such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg points out that the "open source" movement is not concerned with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented if vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed," he says and takes on the ever-increasing mergers in the global agribusiness, as it is offered on farmers markets, for example, that the way in which this vegetables is grown is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without a seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative agree to provide others with their seeds free of charge. in contrast, their approach is opposed to patent seed and plant traits.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supplies is compromised, as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always available.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all the antitrust features are protected as intellectual property, which makes it difficult for plant breeders to be used either at all or even more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2659">Such estimates are not yet available for other plants, but experts such as Luby suggest that mass-grown plants such as wheat are patented in an even bigger style than salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of perspective</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are grown in such a way that they exhibit specific desired traits - from such, through which their taste or colour improves through to those, due to which they thrive in certain environments and endure threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant traits indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing through more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary at present than ever since the changed conditions are far more difficult to predict due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-Speaker Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it does not contradict other breeders" "" "patents and protection of plant varieties" "". "" "" "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expires." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Thus, such protection does not hinder innovation, but promotes it by making more material and know-how available to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees it different: waiting for 20 years until a patent expires, certainly no innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to grow plants that have been adapted to the changed conditions of the environment, you would have already lost the battle.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">"" "" "" "we want farmers to make their work easier." ""</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us forward and it is impossible for us to continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">All in all, Morton interferes with the concept of patenting plant traits: "we do not really create the features ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Depp, plant breeder in the US state Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "if you breed a variety, you also breed its own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Anyone who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation is needed mass herbicides, is breeding in its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is contrary to the contrary." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such as are in international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) patents, most smaller seed companies are able to survive without patents - either they reject the experiment or they keep it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton also believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding herbal patents: "it looks like I'm working with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patent.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalogue, since I know that my opponents sell my varieties for a few years, "he says." with a patent, one is protected from competition for 20 years, with which one makes it very simple in my opinion. "worldwide feedback</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the US seems to be a leader in the "open source" breeding, the concept now spreads quickly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, implements an open-source seed program. to preserve the seed of traditional crops, the centre works with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">"" "it also supports them to come to" "" "Open Source" "" "seeds and sell their own." ""</seg>
<seg id="2686">"" "the German organization Agrecol is working on an" "" "open source" "" "license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of Ossi commitment to breeders in the European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="2687">(instructions for breeding differ from country to country, so the Ossi obligation cannot simply be adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is at the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia, where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organisations and seed companies from all over East Africa gathered to learn about the "open source" seed movement and the worldwide trend towards patents on seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for "Open Source" seed systems, explains that the organization is currently setting up a global alliance for open source seed systems for the planned next year of the official launch.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A consortium of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the Action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest censorship targets in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities are still blocking content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it hit the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of August 5th, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported the above.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the Network published a comment on Facebook in which it sharply criticized the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights information remains true to its goal to defend freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, to expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, so it has never been as important as it is now.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arabic-language issue of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network, based on alleged "support for terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1st Human Rights Organization of the wave of web sites to victims. @ anhri one of the main data sources for human rights in Arab language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took advantage of his blog for the spread of columns and articles that he writes for non-accessible websites and media for Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog he set up to circumvent the Egyptian government's censorship was the goal of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider for which Ziadas blog is located, on the other hand, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 while he reported about the student protests and recorded a video how police exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">Attempting to lock blogs is very old, but in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi priority; and although the blocking of the blog may not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) They have managed to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege; arrest, attempted murder, summons at the National Security Council, the blocking blogs as well as any other web site I worked for.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You proved that I did not write for nothing. in other words, my words have influence, even if only to a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post articles to avoid censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after they have locked it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave ones walk the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities closed up 133 pages from 24 May to 06 August 133. this resulted in technical testing in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Wafte also documented the blocking of providers, through the circumvention of internetensage and private surfing possible, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12th we noticed how the blocking of web pages that VPNs offer began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the government's intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users might have access to.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is additionally exacerbated by the fact that the decisions of censorship are being made behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian population does not have a legal basis to take action against these acts.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>

<seg id="2752">Photo by: Estado Maior (CML) via photos Públicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0</seg>
<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers in Brazil are reporting with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "" "" "14-year old in school" "", "" "" "In the second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered," "" "thieves predatory pharmacy with military weapons," "" "President Timer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and airwaves to Rio." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the violence threshold of 2017 in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "the newspaper" "" "This is not normal" "" "in which she announced to set up a new section called" "" "War in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The newspaper explains the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in any major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. everything, however, deviates from the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the heading "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: that is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we, as journalists, do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four minute video that was shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper stated that this decision was not an occasion for pride but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war reputation in a country that doesn't recognize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist writes that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper writes on:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to cover atrocities of the police who first shoot and then ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it does?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist Cecília Oliveira, on the other hand, argues that violence as a "war" is argued.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of the military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Remember: the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2776">Photo by: Fernando Frazão / Agência Brasil. publication courtesy of Fernando Frazão / Agência Brasil.</seg>
<seg id="2777">According to Cecília, "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil lie in the north and north-east of the country according to the statistics of 2015. these are the most up-to-date data available.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "if we look at the murders per state, Rio is in number 16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">Extra belongs to Globo, the largest media enterprise in South America, which, as Cecília stresses, has been repeating the state's security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">The establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit imposed by the state of Rio in 2003, was also part of these security policy measures.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning this led to a decline of violent deaths. for several years, however, the UPP has been increasingly under fire after several reports of harassment and repression against the poor communities that should protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux quoted from one of his articles in 2010, explaining why the violence in Rio is not consistent with the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention on the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also involves serious consequences for people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This requires the state to use resources and paths that are typical of a war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," in which a civilian is an unsharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "lost balls."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War going back or forth, the fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas in Rio are still suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2788">It is a week ago that the police cleared the mountain with the Favela Jacarzinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence this incident also made headlines: a salesman died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the Peace Organisation PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and surrounding countries, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Eastern Ghouta region is particularly affected, where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 required the lives of hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition are assuming that the Assad regime's massacre was perpetrated on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas have been under siege by rebel forces, leading to the fact that inhabitants are dependent on locally produced or through tunnels and control points of smuggled foods.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">"" "as a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas how they can plant their own mushrooms as" "" "life-saving food source" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and run the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to the traditional food-based foods and are only rarely part of the Syrian kitchen. however, their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The right of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and waiters." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">"" "Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices that has been struggling for three years to make this project known and expressed its relief that it is now becoming more and more" "" "more familiar" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2814">To earn money for the initiative, you can use the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alfonda.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to give 125 families knowledge to grow mushrooms, says Dr. Leila to Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of around €12,700, but will continue to collect donations to CanDo by Monday, 04 September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative relies on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Due to the shortages of fuel, locally produced plastic fuels are used to supply generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">"" "Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they started the" "" "production of fungal seeds originating in the regions" "" "before verifying their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption." ""</seg>
<seg id="2820">Then they planted a small mushroom graveyard in a tub. when this succeeded, they used a bigger tub. and so on.</seg>
<seg id="2821">"" "now they have designed a" "" "educational farm for the region." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed mushrooms throughout East Ghouta for free.</seg>

<seg id="2832">Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the 2017 fires</seg>
<seg id="2833">On the 21st of October several hundred people protested in many district capital cities in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of the fires that were rampant in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the fact that the government proclaimed a state shower last week from solidarity with the victims for three days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Brandies were also registered in the Galician region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fire bursts spreading in the northern and central regions of the country and reaching about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy occured in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest monitoring system, which monitors forest areas by satellite imagery alone, about 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the Lisbon area.</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can get a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire in 4 districts.</seg>

<seg id="2851">In addition, building permits for locations with a high fire risk are questioned.</seg>
<seg id="2852">A wide-reaching reform proposal introduced by the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 was objected by the local authorities, who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment.</seg>

""</seg>
<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of slightly flammable wood, are spreading, as in a vicious circle, after fires of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2855">On these issues, the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15 and 16, as inhabitants searched for information or tried to contact members, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: they used their own civil protection data using the application fove.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina in order to simplify the work of the fire brigade and, at this fateful weekend in October, was so crucial that the servers were not able to withstand the onslaught of 400,000 users who followed the fires: the site counted more than half a million hits.</seg>

<seg id="2874">Two years before, a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin groups who had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. thus, Afghanistan has become a country of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">At that time, Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, sat in the province of Ghazni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even though his mother didn't say it so at that time, she knew she would no longer see her son anymore - maybe even more.</seg>

<seg id="2896">Some time Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to help needy twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that due to relatively high twin quotas, Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers. however, it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers find in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The Human Rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000" "" "special reception centres" "". "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unqualified personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian law asylum seekers can only be allocated to a recording center if they have officially filed an application for asylum - which can be withdrawn for months after the registration of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation are either dependent on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his irrepressible lifestyles helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">Having done various work in the construction industry for several years, Asharaf hid his entire savings in the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">It was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food snack.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis's success story is now the subject of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film won the Venice City Award 2017, which has been awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">A lot of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to inofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the road to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, a number of Afghans have arisen, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of its journey to Italy by the different Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the restaurant peace & amp; Spice and also behind pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome also represent Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">But Asharafs goals go far beyond the Italian restaurant industry and retail, and aim back to the country that forced him to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "where there is a risk, there are also possibilities," "" "says Asharaf with a smile." "" "I want to invest in Afghanistan." ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as everyone else." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">"" "Asharaf also formulates plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques." "" "so they can sell their crop surpluses on the market and improve their financial situation," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end there is stability and prosperity.</seg>

<seg id="2929">He reported about the clearance of the camp Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo, protesting against the removal of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>

<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen's Report is an international snapshot showing challenges, victories and emerging trends in global internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament reviews a bill that foresees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users would have to register in order to use social networks within six months following the submission of the law on the authority's website stating their full name and their ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who miss this step could be sentenced to up to six months imprisonment or penalties of a penal payment.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was applied by sixty members of parliament, is currently awaiting the legislative and the constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "another MP filed a legislative proposal in May to introduce tougher penalties for the insult of the president or a high civil servant." ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the legislation, such an act would be punished with prison and fines, as legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is passed, this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the convicted.</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) on 13 August 2013 when he captured Egyptian police officers, demonstrating violence against protesters who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the impeachment of elected president Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan waited, like more than 700 protest participants arrested at the same incident, four years in jail for a trial date.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed on 20 May, because the prison leadership failed to bring the accused from prison to the courtroom, according to human rights groups.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan threatens the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, apparent contamination of e.g. arms, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a Criminal Court in Giza denied the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were accused of reporting on the pro-Morsi sitting block on Raba'a Al-Adaviya Square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The court also reduced the punishments of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested at the previous incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Interrogating Tunisian activists on verified documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours hearing the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, who is co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was mainly interrogated by the President of the Republic who, according to the plan, explicitly backed a controversial draft bill that would ensure business people and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption accusing Official Amnesty, provided they return all illegally preserved funds.</seg>
<seg id="2949">This document, published on the website of Nawaat on 21 April, sheds light on how the Presidential plans are to support the legal situation.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia rejected the naming of his sources by stating articles 11 of the Tunisian press code, which journalists have the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In spite of this, he appeared in the County Court in Tunis on May 9 as a witness.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force the users of social media to show their identity?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to new rules by the State Council of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China need a permit before they write or share messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">In the provisions, it is also stated that registration with the full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts assume that this will allow the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks. it is up to now unclear how the authorities will apply these provisions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">"" "" "" "Chinese network citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only selectively in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence." ""</seg>
<seg id="2957">Then do we see ourselves in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">May the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese Messaging App WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "according to Roskomnadzor, WeChat failed to register with the state government as the" "" "organizer of information distribution" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">This term is part of a 2014 law, thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that provide the "publication of information." the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing contents and forcing them on request to suspend user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These websites currently include web sites such as Vkontakte and Odnoisseniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the image board 2.ch.hk, email service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court has locking Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court had the Wikipedias in Turkey, after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English-language articles, the data that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">The Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communication announced that the site was blocked because it was "an information source that collaborates with groups to support a political defamation campaign against Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website. it is thus, among other things, China, one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Britain may not stop snorting</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week sighted documents, the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor real-time communications and install malware programs that decrypt data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunications companies and intelligence services on the proposal, but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation continues until the 19th of May. reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
