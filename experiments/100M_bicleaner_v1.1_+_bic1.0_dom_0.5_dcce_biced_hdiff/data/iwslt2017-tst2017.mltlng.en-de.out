that is James Ris@@ en .
they probably know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
long before one heard Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that the N@@ SA had illeg@@ ally ab@@ used tel@@ eph@@ ones of Americans .
but there is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , in which the CIA literally gave Iran blu@@ epr@@ ints for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter did not like at all ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years , the government has identified Ris@@ en and urged him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol for the pattern of the government to condemn whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and spy on journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media has the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous ones they reveal .
so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many brave re@@ porters were already doing before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to prison .
so from 2007 to 2015 Ris@@ en was ris@@ king the risk of going to jail .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although they said for years that it would be essential to their case , the demands of the government of ris@@ ons were dropped .
the reason : in the time of electronic surveillance , the re@@ porters and sources can hide less and less .
instead of sh@@ utting down and bringing Ris@@ en to the testimony , that could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , secretly bought his telephone links ,
just like his email data , financial and banking information , his credit , and even travel tips with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s supposed source .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary condemned him more than all U.S. governments before him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article about national security has been the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower to a journalist .
so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitution , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on everyone .
but as technology allows the government to circum@@ vent the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and they can do that from the moment they contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand .
today there is communication software that has not yet been written when Ris@@ en wrote his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such a technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet most famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and today has been further developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation .
instead of sending an email , go to a news site , like the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send information , as with any ordinary contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server where only the relevant news agency has access .
so the government cannot proc@@ ure information secretly , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the beginning .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is but a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that end@@ anger all of us .
it is important to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snow@@ den have the opportunity to take offen@@ se . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower ,
or the next environmental officer who al@@ erts the alarm to the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a wall street insi@@ der warns us of the next financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 , the largest data leak in history has been published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; reveal that rich and powerful &#93; have hidden &#91; enormous sums of money &#93; in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to make an explanation . &#93;
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers come to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up that ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s Prime Minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has mail box companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is alleged that a track of US $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ lists .
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release , and on the next uncovered documents .
now it sounds like the plot of an agency ri@@ ller or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems crying out from you , me , ordinary people .
why should this happen to us ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not to pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and this concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
across the globe , media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by a few to hide and obsc@@ ure their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people all around the world seem very conf@@ using , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for prosec@@ ut@@ ors and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what is going on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I also find it interesting that there are less reports on this matter in the USA .
presumably because there have so far been no prominent Americans who came up in these revelations , this sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it &apos;s not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but due to the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens operate , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US .
in fact , in some US states you need less information , you need to provide less information to form a company than to get a library card .
this type of in@@ transparency in the US allows employees of school districts to rip school children .
it has allowed frau@@ d@@ sters to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really shocked us that all the up to one lawyer made suggestions on how to transfer his money .
none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was given money . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as individual cases .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian , wrapped up in a sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this type of behavior difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it may sound very dull , as if nothing could be done to it ; as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I see quite well that things have begun to change .
over the past few years we have seen proposals for greater transparency regarding the owners of companies .
the theme was given political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the EU has recorded in central government at national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the United States la@@ gs behind .
representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliament &apos;s chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama disclosure , this vast insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the United States and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment of change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need ordinary people who get angry when they see other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy who get up and say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparency isn &apos;t good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end this type of in@@ transparency by laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally end the in@@ transparency which now allows this kind of tax avoid@@ ance , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story of how I was kidn@@ apped and landed in the boot of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after finishing my design studies , I made a sale of the farm .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my things .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip through the whole country . then he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake ask him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Where are you sleeping tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans . I don &apos;t want to be kidn@@ apped in the boot of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small boot !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard me say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was lying in bed , gaz@@ ing at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what have I ro@@ cked there ?
a stranger sleeping in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what if he &apos;s crazy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed , sw@@ inging to@@ e tips to the door , and locked my bedroom door .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the work of art he bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my perspective .
maybe the people who were sold to me when foreigners were foreigners , actually friends who were waiting to be discovered ?
to house people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress with me .
let &apos;s take a time leap , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate pul@@ ls out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something . our apartment is converted into a designer bed and breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ B and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor .
they found it great , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham om@@ el@@ ets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I began star@@ ing .
had we just discovered that we were at the same time finding new friends and paying for our rent ?
things were rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out whether this could be a business concept .
so we presented to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people can publicly post images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors are closed when visiting .
over the internet , they can invite wild people to stay with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were waiting for the missi@@ le to be fired .
but they do not .
no one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children we all have learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you focus on the things that you can do well . we could design .
at the Academy of Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who never met before .
can design achieve something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what confidence we were striving for .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left seat neighbour .
this quiet flight of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can read not only your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
this is how most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just so , who actually has Al G@@ ores mobile phone now ?
could you announce on Twitter that he is candidates for office of the President ?
you can now return the cell phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you of some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbor first presented himself with his name ; when he tells you where he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you should have 150 jud@@ gements , all of which say : &quot; he really can hold very well un@@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well thought out feedback system strengthens confidence .
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for people to give negative jud@@ gements .
finally , we decided to wait until both host and guest had handed over their assessments before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is for people to trust one another , depending on how similar they are regarding age and place of residence .
little surprising , we trust people most , who are the most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting to add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by jud@@ gements .
if you have less than three ratings , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation stands out for common ground .
so the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted love .
in addition , we learned that trust depends on how much you are priced .
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one can tell too much , as for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- -- the request is also not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimum degree of openness , such as &quot; great works of art in your apartment ! I make holiday with my family . &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we did not expect was the great deal of people who were more than willing to disp@@ el these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people are entitled to our offer .
you can see three things .
first : incredible good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a need that had not been met before .
for us the business is running very well .
of course there are times when everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who did not celebrate parties or have rav@@ aged apartments .
hosts have let guests stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood on the front line when trust was broken .
there &apos;s nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think about it .
the disappointment that one hears in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
fortunately , a fraction of the total number of overnight stays was only a fraction of the problem .
for men are familiar with one another .
when trust works , wonderful things can arise .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his judgment :
&quot; perfect home for travelers who tend to be prone to heart attacks due to se@@ d@@ entary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Ja@@ vier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives even though they don &apos;t know it properly .
you go to hospital in your own car if you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring you books .
they leave one even longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
this is not the case for every stay .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the thought of sharing come together with money transactions ?
this is a commercial trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but to call it simply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not just the case . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people open a part of themselves , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , you can compare it with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what if at any place visited , a group of residents would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one at a local pub , from which one has never heard before ;
or if you could learn to cook from a five @-@ star chef ?
today , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would arrange apartments from the ground up to sharing one another ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the thought of sharing one &apos;s share ?
I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many car parks that belonged to the government ,
were now offered residents . students who were looking for a place to stay ,
were taught to people whose children had gone out . incub@@ ator programs were started ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host .
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we didn &apos;t re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
there was hospitality even before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why did it just work ?
apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find this ast@@ ounding ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da passes by me .
we know of course that design cannot solve every problem .
but if it could help us if it had this big impact , I wonder what we can use design soon .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or are you supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay at the airport security check .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t blame you for your negative impressions .
this is how the media represent people that look like me .
a study found that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a w@@ anna @-@ fitness fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born that way .
I have decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old , I made the decision to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as a homos@@ exual man , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear my hi@@ j@@ ab , my head covering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : back then it was a feminist declaration of independence , compared to the pressure I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt me to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted pas@@ sively the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Quran .
I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted , and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devotion that deep@@ ened with each reading of the Qur &apos;an .
sometimes the beauty of rhyth@@ m@@ ics sometimes brings me tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
have you ever felt that someone you perc@@ ei@@ ves you fully understands and yet loves you somehow ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I got married and started like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast , had breakfast , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breaking news &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flying in buildings , people jumped out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical mal@@ function ?
my shock quickly turned into indignation .
why should such a thing be done ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I changed the television channel and heard : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Mec@@ ca destro@@ ys ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh my God .
it has not only been attacked by my country , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others transformed me from a citizen into a susp@@ ects .
on the same day we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start with post@@ graduate studies .
I remember -- when we drove silent -- as deep as it went into my seat , and I was the first time I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim .
we moved into our apartment this night in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ke@@ ep in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t be afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed in@@ doors whole week .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather to pray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings came : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims , or by people that were held for Muslims , dra@@ gged and struck down .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have gotten the rage of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain yourself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays we can actually hear people say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it means Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as from a tumor in the body of the USA .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumor in the body of the United States , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympic champi@@ ons .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America more secure ?
there may be some parking spaces , but not stopping terror .
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to a more tolerant approach to people of other fai@@ ths and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington DC area , DC recently told me : people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
in the process of ra@@ dic@@ alization , one has found that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from her church , even from her family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts may make a bra@@ in@@ washing , which causes the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or belief .
if we want to prevent ra@@ dic@@ alization , we must stop the people go to the mos@@ que .
some still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS bases its brut@@ ality on the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human being , I believe that we need to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imagination when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam such as the K@@ u @-@ K@@ lux Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology based on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; holy book &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if you look at them , they do not drive what they &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; read &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that makes them read these things into the scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she pre@@ tended to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was just the opposite . every cl@@ ergy who spoke to them brought them to silence and told her that their anger , their sense of injustice in the world , would only bring them into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would have made sense of their anger , it was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised a solution .
this ima@@ m restored the connection to God and its church .
instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways of real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que forbi@@ d her to join the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ logical studies -- shows that if we fear , at least three things happen .
we accept rather an author@@ itarian government system , conformity and prejudi@@ ce .
a study shows that when people present news reports that were reported neg@@ atively about Muslims , they were more likely to have military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you see when the mood against Muslims fell upward -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in the context of terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two bal@@ lot periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public in order to hollow out the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all .
when assign@@ ing collective guilt it is not just about having to explain oneself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .
De@@ ah was an athlete .
he was talented in the dental medicine , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person I knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when has this young man gone out of my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who was visiting in the afternoon .
he fired on De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or were we safe at home ?
we discussed it and it was not an easy decision for us , as it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us by fear , or one in which we can freely practise our religion .
we decided for the mos@@ que .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we drove sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took him out , drew my shoes , went to the hall of prayer , and what I saw made me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the meeting were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at this moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had had courage and sympathy with panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on the phone number ?
or will you join those who think that we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who might say that you hold a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a think maker with drau@@ ght , work in a pos@@ h think tank , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I &apos;d say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
when one looks at Muslims all over the world , and I did this with the largest study carried out by Muslims all over the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
when people appear as an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about becoming a million@@ aire business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions around the world .
before air pack@@ et delivery has penet@@ rated our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of air machines at the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six @-@ meter high tower consisting of 1 500 bricks . some years ago , they started flying with ropes .
connecting flight machines achieve high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test of space .
they can also build independently drau@@ ght structures .
they have learned to carry burdens , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally respond to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to exceed the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it is necessary to know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available at the highest level e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; landing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear @-@ starter ,
a plane that tries to beat two flies with a flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations .
unlike most star@@ ters , it can float , and thus has great advantages in starting and landing , and is very versatile .
however there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of stern star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ences such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight device doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimal position can be reg@@ ained and the performance can be improved by practi@@ sing .
okay . that &apos;s okay .
during our research , we often ask fundamental abstract questions which advance to the core of the matter .
one such question would be , for example : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts together to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remotely @-@ controlled aircraft , which had only two mov@@ able parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying is working with just one .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ ect , the most mechan@@ ically simple remote @-@ controlled flying machine . it was invented recently .
it has only one moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ dder , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , the inner life happens very much so that it can fly stable and can move everywhere in the room .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern @-@ star@@ ters . to get it to fly , I have to throw it exactly right .
the odds of throwing it right when everyone is watching is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the monster is an exercise in indul@@ gence , this machine is here , the Omni@@ cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is very symmet@@ rical .
this is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
thus he receives the extraordinary ability ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is turned or even rot@@ ates .
of course it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some can be model@@ ed in models , the rest is learned directly while flying .
let us look at this .
when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate two prop@@ ellers .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other counter @-@ clock@@ wise .
when you build them together they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but if something goes wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller falls out , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further , though limited .
we will demonstrate this by making half of it fli@@ ght@@ less .
the last demonstration evalu@@ ates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we accepted commercial micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ters -- each of them weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where it is in the room and is self @-@ governed . therefore , there is no limit .
hopefully these demonstrations motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the specially safe machine as it would like to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology .
for types like us , wages are in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it allows creative , intelligent creatures to form them in so spectacular ways .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed each other in a far distant gal@@ axy , they transformed the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second into pure energy .
this short moment they lit up bri@@ ghtly than all stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not use their energy in the form of light --
we finally talk about black holes .
the whole energy was released into space @-@ time @-@ fabric itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us classi@@ fy the events at first .
some 1.3 billion years ago , there was just a few cell lives on Earth .
since then the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God stand at us -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly brave -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector in order to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ wave @-@ observ@@ atory .
in the following years , the precision of Lig@@ o was significantly increased , which greatly improved the recognition performance .
that is why it is now called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to solve some minor , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the operation of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ di@@ ating black holes penet@@ rated through the earth .
you went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of my Dau@@ ghter
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the farewell to my death @-@ sick father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fruits of my life were basically the fruits of my life .
AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes for 23 years and their through observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a force of force in the structure of space and time .
when the wave is over , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and pushed into the other .
for illustr@@ ative purposes , lec@@ turers often lead to a real dance in the theory of rel@@ ativity .
&quot; stretching and st@@ ow@@ age , stretching and st@@ ow@@ age . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and stretched during the arrival of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a followed by a 1 . this was the reason why the Lig@@ o staff was declared crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometre @-@ long laser detector , and that is already absurd , this length should be measured in less than a thous@@ and@@ th of a nucle@@ us of an atomic nucle@@ us . that is grot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public will certainly overcome all obstacles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne released this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to claim that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength which is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile phone .
this is quite practical , because so you can make a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you .
when it comes to sounds , this is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
this is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you :
your child &apos;s face , for example .
instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume , in order to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now Alice is talking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob breaks them up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid Bob &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe speak .
to listen to the gravity , we can tell us a lot about the collision between two black holes , with which my colleague Scott occupies a very long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , chir@@ p simple : w@@ up@@ p !
turn the two bodies very fast , you hear the same p@@ ant with an additional key change . that sounds like : wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of motion vocabulary , ind@@ ented into the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- I heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render sound &#93; somebody who knows what he needs to hear knows this as a noise of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold sun mass that rotate approximately as fast as the rods of your sha@@ ker .
AA : let &apos;s consider what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , cir@@ cling a hundred times per second before col@@ li@@ ding .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know because we heard it .
this is the permanent meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o is pav@@ ing a completely new way for the exploration of the universe , as it has never been possible before .
on this way we can listen to the universe and hear the un@@ seen .
much in space we can &apos;t see -- practical or fundamentally -- not .
a super @-@ nov@@ a , for example . I &apos;d like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super@@ nov@@ a .
they are very useful . from them we have learned a lot about the universe .
but the exciting physical processes happen in the nucle@@ us , which lies hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never go through because they are opa@@ que .
the Big B@@ ang : I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them as the Big B@@ ang is covered by his own gle@@ am .
using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves it should be possible to look back at the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen , we will never see and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , in the first attempt , Lig@@ o found things that we had not expected .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , as Lig@@ o observed them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies of prehistoric times . the black holes are , so to speak , the sau@@ erk@@ no@@ ches for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different perspective on the happ@@ enings in space , the gen@@ esis of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and cir@@ cus of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
do you dream with us ?
thank you .
some time ago , I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of which I was afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did I want to talk to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start playing ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a mad thing happened : to do exactly what I feared , my fear eliminated .
my fear to keep talking , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , gone .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply to an unexpected way . it started with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , men@@ tions all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; little k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my be@@ ak cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
from then on I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play with my children saved my career . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think things out , stir up my life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I produce television .
I make television , in great style .
in this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program in the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each program offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode every nine days at four shows , ie all nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three programmes that are simultaneously in production , times four , 16 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America , my TV series are running succ@@ essively on Thursday evening .
throughout the world , my series are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I created myself , and not only produced , so also above . I must find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires burning around the world .
do you know who else is doing this ?
nobody , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you that all of you who work so hard , whether you are managing a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a household , take me seriously when I speak of work , so that you understand that I &apos;m not just hanging around on the computer and imagin@@ ative , and it &apos;s true when I say that it &apos;s not about dreams in a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m deep@@ ening into work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
it is like I set up troops as I painted on a canvas .
thus , if you make a high sound , you should run a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love working .
it is creative , mechanical , ar@@ du@@ ous and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clinical and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable . and the best of it is the bu@@ zz .
there is such a change in me when the work goes well .
a hum@@ ming begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy street , I could go for it forever .
many people accept when I explain to them the sums that I write about writing that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t get me wrong , that &apos;s what it does .
but the h@@ um -- when I began to work and work with TV production when I began to work and work , build , create and collaborate , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz , this energy .
the sum is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the h@@ um is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the h@@ um is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz@@ ing , you can &apos;t asp@@ ire any other way to size .
the feeling of not being able to be different than striving for size , no matter what price .
this is called bu@@ zz .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
perhaps it is genius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I &apos;m not for failure , and I only know that I love the bu@@ zz .
I just want to tell you I &apos;m a Titan and I know that I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make it clear : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more episodes , the more work there are , the more things I write , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
I like this h@@ um . I love the h@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I need the h@@ um . I am the h@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
am I just this hum@@ ming ?
and then the bu@@ zz stopped .
revised , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burned out .
the h@@ um stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mom@@ my is a single work institute .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mo@@ m won &apos;t be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; little k@@ itt@@ ens , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are Baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the Sum@@ ma stopped .
the bu@@ zz of the engine was silent .
I didn &apos;t like my job any more . the engine was off .
the sum did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours days , weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ate , a Titan does not sleep , do not give up , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no bu@@ zz .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show@@ piece titanium ,
everything was gray , I just had no more fun .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the h@@ um and the h@@ um was me .
so what do you do if what you do is suddenly leaving the work you love ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some people may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hypo@@ cr@@ ite you , stupid Author Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do it , you do it you do , you love what you are doing , being a teacher , a ban@@ ker , being a mother , a painter , Bill Gates to be , one loves another and that gives one the bu@@ zz when you know the bu@@ zz once you know the bu@@ zz , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Southern States wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no when I am aware of two things :
first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she calls no more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did this happen ?
I miss it when I &apos;m titanium and my bu@@ zz@@ ing grow@@ ls , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of bu@@ zz , I cannot do anything except watch out .
I am focused .
I &apos;m quiet .
the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and moist kis@@ ses , tender voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl is letting go of &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
peace and simplicity everywhere .
the air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in .
and not immediately , but it happens , it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz is slowly coming back .
no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the tot@@ als , but a bu@@ zz@@ ing .
and now I feel like I know a magic secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sums , the sums of work , the titan@@ ic um@@ ming , that is only the substitute .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself with the help of shows and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sums are .
h@@ um is not a force and it is not labor @-@ specific .
it depends on the pleasure .
the real sums depend on love .
the sum is the current that comes from the lust of life .
real sums are self @-@ confidence and peace .
real sums ignore the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , expectation and pressure .
the real sums are simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , because what god told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I usually do this so that I can free myself from any debt as a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not lying to me as much as work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to work at work than at home .
this admission is painful , because what a person prefers working rather than being home ?
well , I am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of these .
we hur@@ ried around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst so@@ aps of soap .
I feel mostly stiff , absent and confused .
I always take my mobile phone .
but it is OK .
my children show me how to live , and the bu@@ zz of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also say yes if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you consider me na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you &apos;re right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they &apos;re not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show character .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else .
it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or bis@@ cuit replaces me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and when my teen@@ age daughter speaks with me for 15 minutes , I am mother of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just 15 minutes , more don &apos;t need it anymore .
everyone can take 15 minutes to play , even in a bad mood !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner prepared by children .
but 15 minutes are possible !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is important to feel the tot@@ als , to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about pleasure ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself for the 15 minutes !
find out what you &apos;re doing well .
find out and keep it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I &apos;m victorious . meeting friends , reading books , enjoying the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training , when I wanted to out@@ do myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes a piece , why not treat yourself for 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz@@ ing came back in my spare time . the h@@ um then seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working does not work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months , a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . it leads me to new ideas .
I like the h@@ um , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not the h@@ um , the h@@ um is not me ... no more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my sum .
the bu@@ zz of life .
the h@@ um of love .
the sum of the work is part of me , but only one part . and for that I am so grateful .
I know that I am a Titan . I have never seen a titanium , the trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my bon@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the more happy I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clearer my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the h@@ um . the country I created , the marathon I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high sound , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the h@@ um , the other , the right bu@@ zz : the bu@@ zz of life .
the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more this unusual , lasting , naked and new feeling of living within me is wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more I know who I am .
I am a writer . I think things out , I am raising you to life .
that is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to another after a heavy stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical measures .
for sure , they have heard of one of the best known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; in doing so , an electro@@ de is im@@ planted in the brain in order to influence the circuits of the neur@@ ons in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function is improved .
it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson &apos;s disease who suffered from severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ cure .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is to restore the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help , the brain can help itself .
history began 15 years ago .
at that time , I was Senior Consul@@ tant and worked night and night in the emergency room .
often I provided patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
they must imagine that in skull @-@ brain trauma the brain sw@@ ells and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
in order to save life , it is necessary to reduce cran@@ ial pressure .
to do this , you sometimes have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the environment to make it prosp@@ er .
that is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François was able to do so .
he saw that under his microscope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can turn into any cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they split slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our brain @-@ brain cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the fet@@ us stage , they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they keep us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations .
but this is not so sure .
but one thing is clear -- we got our stem cells from these cells .
we stand before a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to extract a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and then color them in color to be able to follow them in the brain .
in the last step , we re @-@ introduced them to the est@@ ran@@ gement of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we re @-@ implant these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re @-@ implant the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler , we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario we re @-@ planted the cells into a healthy brain and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken back home . the room is already occupied , they are not used there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we inserted an injury and reim@@ plant@@ ated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained intact -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that have been reim@@ ported .
the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells we dy@@ e in vitro , in culture .
of course we couldn &apos;t stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity problem .
they had to take food pellets from one tablet .
they made it very good .
when they reached a stable skill level , we injured the motor @-@ motor area in the motor cor@@ tex .
ther@@ eu@@ pon the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand any more .
just as it would happen in humans , they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ sed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just like the monkeys .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left you see the monkey , who recovered spontaneously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance prior to injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now see when we re @-@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the expl@@ ant@@ ation .
I can tell you that these were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze it and use it later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to implant them in humans .
I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain has the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Giussani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need it . &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials on humans .
Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , you have to fill approximately two kilograms of papers and forms to pass through this kind of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , and so on .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will it allow us the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment .
after that , it is necessary to apply this to a multic@@ enter study .
first you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for your visit to TED and that you have told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as imm@@ utable fact .
we believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have proven without doubt that it is possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
democracy is in fact d@@ wind@@ ling with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was unmistak@@ ably clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not influence the austerity programmes implemented in Greece .
at this moment I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sincere friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for a real democracy .
I ask you , along with me to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group are mistaken , we could save us democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess democracy .
for without democracy our societies are mi@@ gh@@ tier , our future ble@@ ak and our great new technologies are wasted .
on the subject of waste , I would like to point out to you an interesting contradiction which currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the twin summit parad@@ ox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt that th@@ rows his long shadow over the United States , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the mountain of debt ,
but few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unused cash that belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations , but it is too timi@@ d to invest in where it would be productive and bring income , with which one could burden the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past three months , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars have been invested in the United States , England and the euro@@ zone , in all the wealth producing goods such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
3.@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US Dollar sounds like a lot of money , until one compar@@ es it with the $ 5.1 billion that at the same time circul@@ ated in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did absolutely nothing but to infl@@ ate stock markets and to raise real estate prices .
thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks , which are not equ@@ alled by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and consequently a low macro@@ economic demand which , as in an endless loop , supports the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which , fear@@ ing , the prophecy of the O@@ missi@@ le could be true that his son would kill him if he is grown up ,
invol@@ un@@ tarily , the circumstances cause the body to kill him .
that is my shar@@ k with capitalism --
its most extravag@@ ant form . all un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , further develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth .
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government .
the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy naturally ended too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy on the basis of these exclu@@ sions .
the decisive thing about the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it involved the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more importantly and decisi@@ vely , which they gave them the right to political co@@ determination with equal wei@@ ghting in questions of state concerns .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long --
like a candle that shines bri@@ ghtly , it is burned out quickly .
however , our present @-@ day liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies have not roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Palestinian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers .
for the liberal democracy did not emerge until a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone .
in our demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time that this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two is taking place , while the economy gradually under@@ mines policy and dis@@ em@@ powers them .
wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not due to a degeneration of their DNA .
it is because you can be in the government today , and yet not in power , because the power is mig@@ rated from politics into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my shar@@ k with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that so sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals they feed on , that they end up star@@ ving at the end .
similarly , it is with the economy that has driven politics so far that it har@@ ms itself through the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of the corporations is growing , political goods are de@@ valued , ine@@ quality is rising , the overall economic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism exp@@ els the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the wa@@ sting of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity .
if this is true , it is obvious that we must bring together politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; keep control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist Left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain their position as in ancient Athens without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and wast@@ efulness .
but there is a solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers by automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste of sub@@ du@@ ed , and social conflicts lower , as it is -- already very soon , as I think -- in countries like China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to re@@ structure the economy and re@@ unite the areas of business and politics , and make sure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re @-@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy which makes the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a documentary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question therefore is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; or something similar to the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long talks about the meaning of life .
I think we can be optimistic .
so what would it be like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; utop@@ ia instead of &quot; matrix &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation I would like to give you some examples .
in the area of companies : please imagine a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter where you are working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company .
then all revenues from capital and revenues come from revenues and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction between those who belong to the company , but who do not work in it , and employees who work there , which the company does not belong to . no more exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no to@@ wering twin peaks .
in the area of global political economy : please briefly imagine that our national currencies would have a vac@@ ill@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 major emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; Kosmos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund .
imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , particularly in parts of the world where investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes suggested in the 1944 Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference .
the problem was that at that time one did not have the technical means to implement it .
today we have them , especially against the backdrop of a re@@ unified policy and economy .
the world I describe to you is at the same time liberal in which it prefers privileged people , and Marxist , because it will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global Key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all , it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
will we aw@@ aken in such a world ?
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better .
thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liberal Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I have just said is relevant then Marx is relevant .
the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do that , technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers describes as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next as we currently experience it , it will dest@@ abil@@ ise not only our demo@@ cra@@ cies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant ,
like Ha@@ ye@@ k , I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am completely confused .
BG : actually , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you think from the West &apos;s point of view on China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great amount of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of a democracy .
as I said in my speech , we limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it takes place -- the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone .
in some ways , if I can say so pro@@ voc@@ atively , China today resembles the Great Britain of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- that &apos;s a mistake , historically regarded .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , as John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical about democratic development .
what one can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
to submit to China now to do what the West did in the 19th century itself sm@@ elled tremend@@ ously to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I sen@@ sed that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later in the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing , because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely to say goodbye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency and the continuous denial that a massive fault line passed through the euro@@ zone , and continues , which massi@@ vely threat@@ ens the development of the whole of the European Union .
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which , by the way , was the first proposal that revealed this denial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to do it . unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , have continued to choose denial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what is coming .
that is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one tries to maintain an economic system that is not viable to live through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , it may perhaps delay a while , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes are you looking forward to ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : have you made any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone looking back -- Seri@@ ously ...
if there is a finance minister or any minister who claims after 6 months in office , especially in such a stra@@ ined situation , he claims he has made no mistake , then that is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extending the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the len@@ ders of the don@@ ors to find a common solution .
but that didn &apos;t exist .
they merely wanted to bring down our government , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions imposed by the euro@@ zone .
they did not want to admit that they had been carrying out a disa@@ strous programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika that imposed this policy on us said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of talks , you seem to be still pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my greatest fear is that the euro@@ zone doesn &apos;t survive .
for if they do not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not be disa@@ strous for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to adopt the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it appears to me it will be equally detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope you &apos;re wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for having been with TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
of Roy Price most have never heard , although he is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19th , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel hair@@ do and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV shows that Roy doesn &apos;t have any choice .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right corner of this curve .
this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows you get this review .
if your show is evaluated with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive , where after you have watched a relay , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what &apos;s going on at this end of the turn .
Roy Price does not care about the left side of the corner because I think one needs special intelligence to prohi@@ bit &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the average pron@@ unci@@ ation , average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t exc@@ ite .
so he must make sure he is really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s also the first time that Amazon makes such a thing , that &apos;s why Roy price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes lots of ideas for TV shows and selected eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online , where they can watch everyone free of charge .
and if Amazon get things out of it for free , do you get too , right ?
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
but they do not know that they are watched while watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you record when you start the show when you pause , which parts you ski@@ pping or looking at again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce with these data .
in fact , they collect the data , process it and get the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked on .
about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design by Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find them a super @-@ show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a little different .
instead of organising a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the reviews they give the shows their course , which shows they like etc .
then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , what producers , what actors .
when they had all the pieces together they took a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course , the question is : what happened here ?
one has two very competitive , data vers@@ ed companies .
they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this about ?
because logic somehow means that it should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data for a decision you make , then you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
you optimize it with very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis doesn &apos;t work , then this is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anyone know the Multi @-@ Health Systems company ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software . come in touch , you are in prison .
if someone is in prison here in the United States and asks for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ miss@@ al is carried out or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate TV , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . it is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data of the most experienced companies is also wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that they can anticipate out@@ breaks of flu , the worst kind , by data analysis of Google research .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ minated in a publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it worked fine , year by year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data streams into decisions of life -- at work , in legal enforcement , in medicine .
so we should make sure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ based genetics -- an area where some very smart people can use many data uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably to make serious decisions , such as making the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you mostly do two things :
first , dis@@ assemble this problem into his individual parts so that you can analyze the items ; as a second , you put the items together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help dis@@ assemble a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then to come to a decision .
for this there is another tool and we all possess it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to put parts and pieces together again even if the information is incomplete , in order to get a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert .
therefore , I believe Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful , because they used data and understanding , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what else they wouldn &apos;t have been capable of . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like House of Cards does not stand in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first as they comp@@ eted for TV ideas , then they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget this , this device is quite useful .
many of you will be ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no @-@ Ques@@ tion , you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; highly prob@@ able &quot; -- exactly here at this moment .
I will challenge it later with a technique demonstration .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , and I should have listened to the ball in retro@@ sp@@ ect .
but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you want to replace them with something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so maybe the ball will be smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter . ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right corner .
and I feel this very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays to make decisions , an expert in what you do , and take risks .
in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
