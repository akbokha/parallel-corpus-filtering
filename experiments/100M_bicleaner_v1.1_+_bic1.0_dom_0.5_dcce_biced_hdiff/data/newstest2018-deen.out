Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren institution , where young people are to meet today .
a cryp@@ t chapel , where now it is dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
farmers are cultiv@@ ating the former bottom of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich supports exciting stories about days .
it &apos;s annoying if maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows this , who had to get upset because the car na@@ v showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bavaria of the State Government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but especially so very insi@@ ghtful .
especially when comparing them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread @-@ area of Munich &apos;s Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria at@@ las is a pat@@ ch@@ work that one does not recognize as such .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the large overview map , more detailed maps , so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; original sheets &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; were incorporated for cities and municipalities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these were created according to the Bay@@ erische Ver@@ mess@@ ungs@@ verwaltung between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
since the spring of 1800 , the French military leader occupied Bavaria during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographical survey of Bavaria on behalf - of course for military purposes .
even though the French troops mar@@ ched with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville of February 9 , 18@@ 01 , it was today &apos;s neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian sur@@ veying management . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the composition sheet for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and can be found on the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek ( Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek ) .
the comparison of early / present is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the map was created , in 18@@ 77 , as the Munich subur@@ b .
today , Lower Saxony is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : at the zo@@ oming , a smaller @-@ scale map appears with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbered plots of the so @-@ called &quot; judgment , &quot; from which the land tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small par@@ c@@ els are no more farmers there today - but farmers in the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the scene of the October festival in 18@@ 10 , was actually still a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the reference sheet , in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; on the Gast@@ eig &quot; or the &quot; Auf der Lü@@ ften &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich circle Ir@@ ren@@ berg was created &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden managed the establishment - that psychiat@@ rist , who is brought to death by King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and , for example , finished the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also prohibited the personnel to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who worked for an exhibition with the institution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for 280 patients there was first place , later it was extended to 500 places .
at some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in Haar &#91; 1905 &#93; .
the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , has been there since 2006 .
young people in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um will meet at the site of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth hostel with educational establishments .
West is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was built in an architectural all@@ usion to the original construction of the Ir@@ ren@@ berg , which had been destroyed during World War II by bombing ra@@ ids . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was marked as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 18@@ 56 . the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also made a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the inner city in December 1944 .
a large one remained until today - at Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business buildings and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days the prepar@@ atory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn track .
with the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil rights group publishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for Col@@ ors has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discri@@ min@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which will enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , demands special attention to af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans , as a series of question@@ able , race @-@ based incidents occur throughout the country and can be noted here , &quot; says the Group &apos;s opinion .
a recent law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to win discrimination , as well as the state &apos;s prosecution authorities that are dispro@@ portion@@ ately aimed at minorities , led the group to publish the travel warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the US .
the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist events against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died in question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the trip through the state and was taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of crime .
the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i At@@ tor@@ ney General in which it is shown that black drivers in the state will stop 75 percent more often than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be ready to bring a deposit or let the relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI &apos;s hate crime report that classi@@ fies the state with regard to the number of injuries on the 16th place of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the states had adopted immigration laws that ob@@ lige local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for violations of immigration , which in the view of the AC@@ L@@ U will contribute to further racial profil@@ ing .
travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but lately interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US .
the electric fence project is elementary
the Fisch@@ bacher Wei@@ de@@ fence @-@ Project is a project of success and will continue next year .
the CD@@ U Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have obtained a picture on the spot .
representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U local association together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties met at the court of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially gave insights into his farm , in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and just as many k@@ itt@@ ens and houses in five apartments holiday palaces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the alternative @-@ less marketing path for the milk of its cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only region@@ ales come to the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as he is also B@@ L@@ H@@ V @-@ Chairman of Fis@@ her@@ man &apos;s bach he described the electric fence project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot profit@@ ably manage such steep surfaces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the grass@@ land area provides a lot of work , a lot must be handled with the br@@ ush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental farm and engaged it without chemical plant protection and ferti@@ liz@@ ers , even if he does not lead a bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader &apos;s support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported .
I hope that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the surfaces could be dra@@ gged out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and making thoughts about how they carry on their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often critic@@ ised for funding
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced about the electric fence in 2013 .
the preservation area is thus 40 hectares , which must not be aff@@ i@@ xed to at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total cost of € 71 500 , half was promoted by leader , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fis@@ her@@ men .
thus the farmers remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of pasture fence .
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and rural women it &apos;s not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Peter Weiss also stood firm : &quot; best food is produced here . &quot;
the landscape conservation directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state promotion of pasture f@@ ences .
the goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest .
the pre@@ condition is the presence of a conveying system designated by the L@@ PR .
moreover , the area to be fenced should not be tu@@ pper@@ y ( slope above 35 per cent ) and must be threatened by aff@@ or@@ estation .
the proposal for eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence , is currently running for the Fis@@ her@@ man &apos;s electric fence project 2018 .
the accounting area is equivalent to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are worth more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N about the President &apos;s suggestions for dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ators would have liked him if he had done it .
but he gra@@ bbed the meaning , and in particular the meaning it was attributed to , as the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to his base .
when Miller compla@@ ined , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem you refer to is later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is properly correct , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary resonance of Laz@@ arus &apos;s stirring words , the only ones in which a state does not only invite old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , your oppressed masses , who y@@ earn to breathe freely , / the miserable waste of your rich shores . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; el@@ event@@ h garbage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better to be seen on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller was not involved in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people were not welcome in the United States .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is in fact a conflict of the importance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who chose to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they performed a highly political act .
the sculpture was to show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by representing the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical depic@@ tion .
Laz@@ arus has changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the Ex@@ il@@ antes .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Laz@@ arus changed the meaning of the statue , the people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone but rather an early neo @-@ conservative , who brings the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty moves forward .
it is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not light the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh stum@@ bled upon something quite unusual .
the meaning of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception .
Laz@@ arus &apos;s great imagin@@ ative act was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted , miserable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships .
it is all about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever want to recognize .
their torch should not light the way , but ign@@ ite the hatred that is their only source of power .
world Cup 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the team of Great Britain
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots were part of the team of Great Britain
&quot; &quot; &quot; the power director of the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ strong Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland something special &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will carry on until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the guy on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ flip - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected by the team as a team captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , regardless of whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feel that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought in was great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver medal winner , who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m barrier , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the mid @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir leads on this road and last year brought five British and two European records .
it will take part in 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1500 m , is another Scot@@ sman , which one should observe after a great season , which included the victory in the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members their first world championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell .
the team captain says that they are &quot; enormously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots do not only belong to the team , but in some cases also be accompanied by med@@ als and fin@@ als .
&quot; the special thing about being a team captain is that it was voted by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honor anyway , but to know that my te@@ amm@@ ate voted for me and chose me , it makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I &apos;m very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb on po@@ di@@ ums .
what is my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to focus on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out and compete there and it &apos;s just going to be a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
block Cri@@ tics over Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of elec@@ tors
the father of our country knew something of a bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers hit him for anything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he bl@@ amed in the criticism , sure .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in the year 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union was therefore su@@ ing him at the beginning of this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na , and ? &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s only Facebook , &quot; many people said .
but it is important .
and it is particularly important when it is a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is a repub@@ li@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state , which is amaz@@ ingly popular .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has the second highest consent of the nation &apos;s 50 govern@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary hot head .
he has shown a firm hand in guiding his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very clever to use Facebook as primary means to connect with his voters and play his hair @-@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side is a public forum that is officially called and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , the spokes@@ woman A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse defended the Gover@@ nor &apos;s actions and argued that the blocking of comments is nothing more than moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p .
the post talked to some of the real people blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are only real people who speak to their elected leaders : a teacher , a business@@ man and a priest , no troll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful , and not profound .
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I pol@@ itely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary section of the news program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I also don &apos;t like this idea when a number of people take a position on the same issue , then they are ignored by some rather than a so @-@ called collective bet and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the Gover@@ nor referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam @-@ attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times when you have done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest demonstr@@ ators and to silence them .
but this is exactly what is happening digit@@ ally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critici@@ ze Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County hurt the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when she ban@@ ished a vot@@ er from her Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit to the AC@@ L@@ U for his use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of an affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers was multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters struck him .
and even then Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions that critic@@ ised his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain were overwhel@@ med by his post , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project .
but he did not silence them .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comfort at the Renaissance Club
the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year led to the final round in Arch@@ er@@ field , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; I &apos;ve seen how the Renaissance club was built and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he fixed this place .
he is an ard@@ ent advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although during his 32 @-@ year career he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that really feels very special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I won &apos;t be able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura against because it was taken out of the program in the year after I had won it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we will always value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday this year , returns to the action on home ground .
this event will be its first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a bit more when you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel that extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad how it went so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer due to passive smoking
fewer and fewer people have died in lung cancer over the past two decades .
scientists from the Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf University Hospital ( U@@ KE ) came to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer deaths are attributable to passive smoking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject in 1994 .
at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new investigation is published in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; International Journal of Public Health &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; the construction works in the Vill@@ etta Street are in full swing and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lie reasonably lately , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the architect Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the area of house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is a lot of hiding in the underground , which is not noted in the plans .
the traffic , which continually obstruc@@ ts construction work , poses a major problem for the Bau@@ tru@@ pp company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of the mot@@ orists from red lights and shut @-@ off grids is already enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road was closed and only the regular buses were allowed to drive through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but luckily we were provided with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty and death in the Indones@@ ian gold country
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she does not use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ship in the uns@@ ett@@ led Indones@@ ian province of Papua , the house@@ wife normally puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace .
after half an hour , the sal@@ ted tu@@ ber is removed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. washing clothes with mur@@ ky water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , no fields were assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , late to work can be dangerous : most villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to walk around the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders should vote in front of the occup@@ ying troops .
an existing movement which stir@@ red up for independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua with the independent part of Papua New Guinea that included the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as secluded as it is desolate . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire , and then a morning 5 hour drive with the rental car .
there is no public transport .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and from corrugated iron roofs , which have been transformed by rust into various yellow @-@ brown tones .
very few Indones@@ ians have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans honored a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her lively , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright coat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst childhood mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land provincial in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has mined gold and copper worth 3.1 billion US dollars .
in addition , Papua has a valued $ 78 billion worth of wood resources .
these riches are , however , a source of misery for the Papua that ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military maintains a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid almost $ 20 million between 1998 and 2004 , among them up to $ 150@@ ,000 in a single officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pap@@ u@@ tian demands for greater autonomy are threatening these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Papua people have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tor@@ tured and imprisoned by the Indones@@ ian military since 1969 .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as tribal high@@ land in the 1970 &quot; s were considered genocide according to the Asia Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indones@@ ian police arrested over 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we value everything &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is said in a report from the year 2016 arch dioc@@ ese in which reports about atro@@ cities of the previous year are , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric hits are especially popular - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as incidents occur every week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bolts have intensified because Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but the demographic development changes as Muslim economic migrants come from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ts cant@@ e@@ ens sell roasted chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served .
local people fight to keep up here .
&quot; migrants began to sell chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than local ones , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai native , who went to work in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura province capital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cost the native Papua @-@ Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Papua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indones@@ ian President , Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jok@@ ho@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Papua during his campaign in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter assured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua , little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ho@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that it will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point only two months after Jok@@ ho@@ is &apos;s inauguration in October .
on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a bon@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali when two Indones@@ ian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers responded to their tone and later returned with four soldiers , according to the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their guns , told victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
one child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so badly beaten that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered at a football field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice .
they wore cerem@@ onial hunting bu@@ cks and performed the Wa@@ ita dance , running around in circles and im@@ itating a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started tow@@ ing stones to police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , a command was sent to the soldiers through an internal radio : &quot; if the masses were resist@@ ing more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says TI@@ ME , which was not released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the director of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
nobody was in the mood to listen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his multic@@ ol@@ ored wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ ame still does not know who fired , but says that the bul@@ let came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he adds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ ane , who , like many Indones@@ ian , bears only one name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I knew him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told re@@ porters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people threaten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings came to Jak@@ arta the following day .
three weeks later , Jok@@ ho@@ i in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura gave a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Minister of Defence , Wi@@ ran@@ to , said in October 2016 that he would establish a judicial mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations .
but the exc@@ uses almost immediately began .
&quot; most of the injuries have occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ ies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations , but there are processes that must be passed through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to with@@ drew when he spoke with TI@@ ME on June 5 in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wi@@ ran@@ to , whom the UN accused of &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; which demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody anti @-@ independence referendum in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses have already been included in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such alle@@ gations with fi@@ erc@@ ely un@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I buried the bodies , the military sought me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings did not stop .
on Tuesday , the Indones@@ ian police shot on villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a unconscious man to hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s site .
the police said the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing a warning signal .
but locals say that the mobile Bri@@ gade ( Indones@@ ian param@@ il@@ itary police ) started shooting at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so pan@@ i@@ cked , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered , such as the TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself in my house for two days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called upon the officers to be held accoun@@ table and to withdraw the police bri@@ gade out of the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a trouble for the Indones@@ ian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al who live in the green High@@ lands of Papua .
many joined the Free Papua Movement ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of Papua by insti@@ g@@ ating spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indones@@ ian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have been arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as a &quot; tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty is strengthening dis@@ content .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
the people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can work on four or five fields of sweet potato .
they keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
over the years , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Papua and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nab@@ ire airport .
the few jobs there are in the region usually go to the better educated and weal@@ thier migrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Papua , we rarely have capital or the necessary skills to make their own businesses competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Board of Directors of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although they were given the rare permission for filming .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow &apos;s campaign to lift the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s most troubled provinces of Papua and West Pap@@ ua : visa Den@@ ial and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indones@@ ian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six Pacific countries - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Papua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai sho@@ ot@@ ings .
the same countries have historically seen the O@@ PM supported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indones@@ ian Foreign Ministry , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , re@@ port@@ edly rejected the accus@@ ations from the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so that it is difficult to cover the evidence for human rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the human right ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , the locals broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but in Papua New Zealand they probably won &apos;t vote for j@@ ok@@ ow@@ i again .
&quot; Jok@@ ho@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but it is surrounded by people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal stock .
he wants that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in poor educational and health services .
Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ho@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; which he has to pay back .
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite threats and in@@ timi@@ dation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ gun@@ men carried out a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the cor@@ pse of an victim was buried in an area just opposite the police and the military station .
they know they will never give justice to them , but at least they don &apos;t forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what else can we do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fire to capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per Dubai for the second time
a fire occurred on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to escape from the 3@@ 37 meter high , 79 @-@ story building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise in only two years , which is accidentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the cry of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; a resident told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said the fire fighting units were extingu@@ ished at 4 : 00 a.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) and cooled the building .
the government said they work on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of sky@@ scra@@ pers all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 found that most of the damage from facing , exterior cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation , came .
in Britain the police said they believe that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding at the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in June about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup Reform : more Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through with his big Davis Cup coup during the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal for this sport revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup sing@@ ular only on two levels of profit was not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
the five @-@ sentence classics which are often very long , but also highly valued five @-@ sentence classics , remain preserved .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 % of member countries voted for the reform , the aim of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but we are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and the F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change in order to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the applications .
not until the vote , after many contradictions , the proposal had already come to fill the finale in a neutral place .
only comparatively small details are new from 2018 : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and the F@@ ed Cup will be the host right in the next round in the next round .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements in training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to do less official media appointments in front of the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers take prohibited items on the plane , find out a pol@@ l
a survey among passengers sur@@ faced that more than 20 percent deliber@@ ate or un@@ consciously banned objects were smu@@ g@@ gled along the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent of the aircraft , while inad@@ vert@@ ently prohibited knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed that they had subsequently discovered that they had gone ast@@ ray with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey of more than 1,000 people , which was conducted by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also stated that younger travellers were more likely to dis@@ regard the rules .
of the respon@@ dents admitted that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent of mill@@ enni@@ als were , compared with less than 15 percent , members of the Generation X .
the most common items that were deliberately passed on to T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent said , know@@ ingly carrying items with blades through security control , while 2.2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs into the aircraft .
the company said it asked travelers across the country to find out how many inad@@ vert@@ ently smu@@ g@@ gled goods to airport security and how many would have done it intentionally .
it is no surprise that the people who are most often smu@@ g@@ gled - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through security , those who were most often flying .
the company points out , however , that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which liquids they may take with you or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids confis@@ cated by the T@@ SA are banned liquids .
for a while people thought T@@ SA could look at books as smu@@ g@@ gled goods .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t care : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
&quot; &quot; &quot; electro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to deal with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in addition to the ever tri@@ ump@@ tuous figures for sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k announced another , less gl@@ amor@@ ous figure at the announcement of the recent quarterly balance sheet : the recent changes in the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k often had more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery just starts .
now Mus@@ k ad@@ mits : 6@@ 3.000 pre @-@ orders have already been withdrawn from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders .
critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is merely non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la will pay the 1000 Euro ( in the United States 1000 US dollars and in Great Britain 1000 pounds ) &quot; Reser@@ vation balance . &quot;
at present 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations envis@@ age , Mus@@ k admitted in a telephone conference with analysts .
Tes@@ la CEO , however , does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders would be a problem .
his argument : the challenge for the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 , all models will be taken together - 500@@ ,000 by 2020 , a million by 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k there are 1800 reservations per day .
anyone who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new production lines that have never been tested in practice without any major interrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if it comes to greater delays , the non @-@ binding of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
after all , the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in dro@@ ves .
EPA boss P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw@@ s due to the reluct@@ ance of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
one day after he was su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , Chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the law@@ suit which had been raised against his previous site in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
the deadline is 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for o@@ zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he will delay the observ@@ ance of a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interfere with local decisions or im@@ pe@@ de economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump State At@@ tor@@ ney of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly committed to blocking or dela@@ ying regulations that resist the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ denti@@ al regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ als in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , which committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in an opinion published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards simply ampli@@ fies the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under earlier administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to comply with the deadlines for execution and then to be tried by activists and others in an agreement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA for more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation through court proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and the authority we give to us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the EPA statement said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; power to delay and all other legally available authority &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the regulations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on sound policies and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive new version of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure has not yet been set up in the Senate .
the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of states that had su@@ ed the EPA this week , said the group intends to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York included in this case California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oreg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ian , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone is created when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight .
the smo@@ g arising can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year .
representatives of public health and environ@@ ment@@ alists were che@@ ering about P@@ ru@@ mah &apos;s surprising course changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is wor@@ rying how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to engage in environmental contam@@ in@@ ants and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ bling celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church
750 years St. Hil@@ arius church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ our will be invited to a seren@@ ade on Sunday , 16th July , at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius complex is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z seren@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and supporters of Tum@@ arc a concern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer Ur@@ ton@@ buch : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church on it to Tum@@ bling along with the Abbey of Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the wor@@ ding of the deed , in addition to the former parish church , in addition to the former parish church , there was also a beautiful courtyard , to which the church or the patron was right and not the other way round .
there were also people living there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ amt Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , it was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the village image of Tum@@ bling , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the noble sett@@ ler nucle@@ us of the village .
old maps from the period around the year 1600 confirm these historical circumstances .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age originated in the early medieval church law .
a gentle@@ man who built a church , furnished and occupied with a priest , remained owner of this church and could also bequ@@ e@@ ath this church .
this was accompanied by the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Gre@@ at@@ est of the two bar@@ red on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly acquired bell was first heard in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over later during World War II in 1942 .
during the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the windows were sm@@ ashed and the bells were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aking .
in 17@@ 96 French troops were station@@ ed near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and the church &apos;s chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from audi@@ ob@@ ooks .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ary church was demol@@ ished .
only the church tower was left standing .
in the New Year &apos;s Eve in 18@@ 34 , a storm split the bell tower and half collap@@ sed .
to prevent mis@@ fortun@@ es , the tower was demol@@ ished .
only the still existing tower was preserved as a witness to the 750 year old church history .
today Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em maintain the Hil@@ arius facility by Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn as successor to Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
the organisers invite the friends and supporters of Tum@@ arc on Sunday , July 16th , to the sixth seren@@ ade on the old cemetery on St. Hil@@ ary &apos;s Chapel .
this is arranged by the com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler gym@@ nasi@@ um of Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
Vor@@ steh@@ er Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 3 : 30 p.m .
to end the seren@@ ade , a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organizers challenge the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organisers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility , which is important for tum@@ ors and audi@@ ob@@ ooks .
the friends and supporters of Tum@@ arc feel particularly committed to home care as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini affir@@ ms .
association wants to be insp@@ ected by wind turbines
&quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim re@@ jects &quot; is not a legal prerequisite for construction and has therefore turned to the coun@@ cill@@ or .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Association has called on Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is un@@ lawful .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of the authorization on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen there was only a wind power concentration zone at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal .
in this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines are princip@@ ally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones should prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spar@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the city of Vier@@ sen had passed a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette a few days earlier - but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved the district government of Düsseldorf , because of a fault .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning permission , the granted approval decision is still un@@ lawful and therefore to be withdrawn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
state of the art : the City Council once again approved the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette before the summer break ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , the granting of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been entered in the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them on occasion to check the matter again .
however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not intend to comment on the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot;
the NEW , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette construction of four 200 @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines .
already last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen is indirectly involved , had closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hect@@ are site .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be met - equivalent to about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ sen@@ iors .
the NEW $ wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer Vier@@ sen &apos;s Town Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park near Aachen and a participation in a wind power plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg , Kreis Hein@@ sberg .

city and merchants plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
in September , Bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ a@@ er and people from the region will re@@ discover the shopping facilities in the city center .
the commercial association and the municipal administration want to take advantage of the weekend on September 8 and 9 in order to enti@@ ce residents to shopping in the city centre .
as the chairman of the trade association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend should sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers to what offers their own city offers apart from the usual supermarket goods .
according to this , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , domestic firms should present themselves with their training places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the city &apos;s shops invite to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mid@@ night Shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action is not only aimed at inhabitants of the city and the surrounding region .
in preparation are commerci@@ als on the radio , an Internet video and printed bags , which point to the action weekend , says Christian König .
city administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with this , the commercial association and the city go to another stage of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive city centre &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes new offers such as the first &quot; Active @-@ Tag &quot; to the well @-@ gro@@ unded Sunday , talks with all businesses and hosts , in order to move them to active participation .
there are also attractive offers on Saturdays and the wai@@ ving of parking fees this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potential should be re @-@ developed or re @-@ developed .
this includes tourists and tourists .
but many locals also lost the city center while shopping .
in the end all would have to contribute to en@@ li@@ ven the inner city - right up to land@@ lords , the businesses of the whole city and associations .
it was necessary to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that had spread to some extent , King had said in the spring .
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that five Thür@@ inger cities will be participating in the nation &apos;s third &quot; home shopping &quot; day .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and strengthen its importance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action led by the I@@ HK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct surroundings with his buying behaviour .

pump deployed after si@@ ghted tran@@ scripts of phone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scripts of phone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and Le@@ aders from Mexico and Australia were released by the Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tr@@ ump called on a telephone call with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned bor@@ der@@ line .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US President re@@ vil@@ ed him because he denoun@@ ced the wall publicly . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to have Mexico charged for the project .
tran@@ scripts of his first call with Australian prime minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and disclosed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the USA refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia was &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade which was medi@@ ated by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after propos@@ ing a ban on the reloc@@ ation of refugees to the US .
Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mo@@ ore Ford &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; massacre : activists re@@ unite rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice &quot; &quot; &quot;
a 1948 @-@ year @-@ old Ford Mer@@ cury was driving through a group of spectators in Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men stood out with guns to block its way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous strip - took a long turn on his ci@@ gar and looked through the wind@@ shield .
inside , the occup@@ ants were floating in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get it out of your car ! &quot;
cries broke the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged by the passenger seat .
fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , is just a reflection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost all of the audience shou@@ ted very real si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 he returns to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night , in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - have been ly@@ n@@ ched by K@@ u K@@ lux Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one ever was accused of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really incredible that in all these years , no single person was arrested - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in organising the job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman of the state Georgia and a life @-@ long civil rights activ@@ ist .
for him , the post @-@ employment serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want the end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must obtain justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we obtain justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court physician places a sheet on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI agents obtained from the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the ly@@ n@@ ching process .
but no one was ever accused .
although the susp@@ ects have remained on the open for decades , citizens &apos; rights activists say that the tw@@ o@@ fold motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the election campaign in the summer .
about the same time as the election st@@ ach , according to the FBI , the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com had a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s &apos;s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore was not of her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white country owner , paid $ 600 to free Mal@@ com from prison , said the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they removed from the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison , who prepared and arranged the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removing evidence and interro@@ gated the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks puts it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a right @-@ to @-@ vote massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you let yourself be registered and if you vote , this will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual production of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their depic@@ tion is vivid , po@@ ign@@ ant and is rooted in a kind of deep racism , from which many would like to believe that it does not exist in America any more .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and still harder to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that &apos;s the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ching because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or want to hear what I &apos;ve done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest Black - went into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a gre@@ edy co @-@ director .
he has played the role of head member member for years , but he said the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not that way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , the actors Dar@@ et@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ con@@ a , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester cries out and har@@ dens him , fur@@ i@@ ously that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; --- he , disappear from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ con@@ a reci@@ proc@@ ates the fire .
there is a pause .
and then everybody ( at least all black actors ) breaks out into laughter .
Gre@@ ene is laughing at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; Ras@@ con@@ a asked .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still gi@@ vin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I simply don &apos;t think white people at that time &apos; n --- he &apos; said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s exactly where the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ i@@ onship replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy doing this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene begins again .
this time , when Ras@@ con@@ a says the N word , he says it sharp and with im@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition is violent and fast .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman clothed with mour@@ ning is above the bodies of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays gri@@ eving lob@@ b@@ ying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen people caught sweat and tears from their eyes .
the audience is divided between black and white .
a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many just come down the street .
they have all experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive humidity for nearly eight hours , when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you stand in the same country , where the Lyn@@ ch mur@@ ders took place , the air feels gh@@ ost@@ ly .
when the last notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the cor@@ pse .
children ho@@ d in their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ um@@ bles a little boy as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thank@@ ed the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the ropes and wipe off their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Mar@@ gh@@ gh , the man in the suit that has played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ con@@ a embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then collap@@ ses in her arms weeping , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done this for one reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience coinci@@ des with the actors for dinner .
a white pair from Atlanta is chat@@ ting at a table about the job with a black pair they just got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words which sense the performance had left behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people that look like you and do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ching is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today this is only called police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks &apos;s court sitting at his table , he eats and re@@ members the civil rights .
he said he already started to plan the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post @-@ employment is inspir@@ ational in a certain way , as it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; reconc@@ iled the Wagner worshi@@ pers in Bay@@ reuth
also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf relies on a colourful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous production in front of a gigantic , six @-@ story backdrop .
the stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) can be used to show a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with wall rest and don@@ er bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car park , in which the Rhine mur@@ ders pos@@ ing as rock@@ ers , or alternatively a Is@@ etta .
stack@@ ed oil barrels are reminiscent of Cast@@ or@@ fs &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power , and greed - which goes through his &quot; ring &quot; production .
the three Rhein@@ gold daughters - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize beautifully as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ESS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will temp@@ t them Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ce ) , cr@@ ush a cor@@ pse in the boot of the Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ker and release the ri@@ ot cli@@ que . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing sings the glori@@ ously fi@@ esen Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ ers .
brutal the scene when he sm@@ iles Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) has to believe in it .
the audience would like to thank the ensemble with a strong applause .
a stor@@ my celebration will be Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ce and conductor Jan@@ owski , who hum@@ bly bowed their heads and bowed their hands to Merkel &apos;s r@@ ô@@ le .
there is great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual casual wear .
the show was eag@@ erly awaited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team .
in 2013 he had to leave a bell concert at the end of the festival , five years later , there was great rejo@@ icing , in which the isolated &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls went down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have rejo@@ iced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only create a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of its view .
I draw a positive summary .
max quantity works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : normally in st@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture market , once a week I help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I also worked at school in an open day @-@ to @-@ day business .
what are your experiences with this ?
quantity : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late professional volunteer .
how does that come about ?
lot : I made S@@ LC .
and then a civil engineer course , we say , successfully cancelled .
I realized for myself that it &apos;s the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else to work with people .
and then I asked myself what to do .
make a social year , there &apos;s an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focus perhaps also , really is .
and was it like that ?
lot : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester .
I am going to study dual , probably doing a social worker training in the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and studying at Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hochschule .
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
lot : yes , it is very variable .
it probably depends where you are going to be FS@@ J .
you can do it from the old people &apos;s home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in afternoon care .
for me it was exactly the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works .
what is different from a civil engineer ?
quantity : well , here it is not about calcul@@ ating St@@ ati@@ ken .
you always have other people in front of you who have a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee , whether a young man , who has been fet@@ ched out of the family - one must always go to it individually .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
lot : I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , great kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is just that .
Pear@@ son cuts 3,000 jobs and cuts divi@@ den@@ ds to revi@@ ve business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that she will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut their divi@@ den@@ ds by 72 percent , as another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure the company faces .
job reductions attributable to Director General John Fall@@ on primarily for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 are in addition to its previous restructuring , where 4,000 jobs have already been lost .
in May Pear@@ son announced plans to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in May in order to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by a quick step towards digital learning .
the company , which had sold its participation in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to Partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann last month , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged , after an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kon@@ vo@@ i attack of Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed on suicide bom@@ b@@ ings
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in Kab@@ ul , an Afgh@@ an capital , killed a soldier of NATO and injured several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter have been viol@@ ated , told Nato &apos;s declaration .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died in the Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h neighborhood .
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a NATO opinion , the explosion on Thursday evening is said to have taken place as a common pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explosive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; carried by people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement says that all injured are in a stable state and are treated at the B@@ agra@@ m air@@ field in the U.S. military hospital .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agra@@ m .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide bom@@ ber killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban claimed they had launched this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the most deadly milit@@ ant attack in the country , since the US forces pushed the Taliban off power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ scores the prec@@ arious level of security in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering raising the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks , the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul also have caused a crisis of public trust in the government , their policies , and especially in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA revers@@ es decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to law@@ suits
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has decided to delay a regulation of the Obama administration , repe@@ aled that the states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place one day after 15 states su@@ aded the agency because of the step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced the decision late on Wednesday to push ahead with the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ zone regulations 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said they show the agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and by responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced in June the EPA &apos;s intention to determine the o@@ zone regulations in which pollut@@ ant emissions are to be measured in a part of the country to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to drive back a wide range of environmental issues imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda , which according to Tr@@ ump should boost economic growth .
however , efforts have spark@@ ed the set@@ backs of the Democrats and nature conservation groups , wor@@ rying about the impact of larger emissions on public health .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA website says that breathing air , which contains o@@ zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduces lung function and can enhance respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
community wants to be communal space
in the end , the decision was clear : in two opposing voices , the council of Bus@@ orn @-@ Win@@ tz@@ els decided to set up a joint space in the future retirement home .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the missing piece of land was signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , it will take a while for the area belonging to the church community to date , but there is now no plans for planning a project to be stem@@ ming from a private investor .
there is a discussion about a shared space .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with 70 square meters of space for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the com@@ mon@@ wealth flo@@ ats in front of seeing such a common room not as a meeting point only for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ ent @-@ just living , but openly inside the community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision to be made by the provision of funds for the current budget is by means of funding opportunities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is in the rehabilitation area .
the establishment of a shared space would be , as reported T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible .
the decision proposal looks to signal the investor that in this respect you don &apos;t want to throw a brid@@ le between the legs , the statement that both artic@@ ulated - which is le@@ aning against the surrounding construction - as well as pul@@ ley roof - which reduces tr@@ ump height and makes construction more economical - it is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; need@@ less to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wil@@ fried sole means this addition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it helps : unanim@@ ously , he passes the board .
it &apos;s not that easy in the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call points to the many own buildings that you don &apos;t get so much forward , but now you rest in the common room out of the window , she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m very hard with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger insi@@ sts on the common room - but absolutely against communal ownership .
she sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to anyway wealthy investors or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , as with the acquisition of the surface there is no surplus , but I receive a real counter@@ value in the case of doubt , the opposite is the opposite .
the proposal to split the decision accordingly finds three pro@@ pon@@ ents .
so it remains with two oppos@@ ites in the original programme that sums up Stefan H@@ aller : &quot; if we put the decision in such a way , we make a giant leap to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
collision with car : cyclists are thrown onto the road
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was caught in Gar@@ ath on Wednesday by a car and was seriously injured .
as the police informed , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the way from Hil@@ den on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg .
the senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver in the same direction gave priority to him .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder drove onto the road , however , he apparently did not pay attention to the on@@ coming traffic .
he met with a car that controlled a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ ch trol@@ ley .
FC Bayern Munich doesn &apos;t have to miss the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba must su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
with personnel care , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first time in the new season .
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) the number of personnel at the German football record master Bayern Munich is getting bigger and bigger at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger @-@ Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti doesn &apos;t have to ab@@ dic@@ ate with the B@@ V@@ B on David Al@@ aba .
this was confirmed by the Italian on Friday .
in addition , the Mun@@ ch@@ ausen Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six trials , An@@ cel@@ otti has been responsible for the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , adding : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last but not least , this was not good . &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is expecting a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday .
in the resin from star to star
&quot; &quot; &quot; the country &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to emerge in the resin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the observ@@ atory is planned by the observ@@ atory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes to meet the need for information of many visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to place tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase by 2018 the association plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
question : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber .
the information on the boards should be expanded by internet .
this is why a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later the Ticket to Ride is to be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star path , the viewers experience a lot of worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association declared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , they learned why stars have different colors or why a star is more lumin@@ ous than another , although it is essentially further away .
you can also medi@@ ate in which con@@ stellation a selected star is found and when it is best to see .
the association has been operating the highest @-@ lying Northern Germany Observ@@ atory since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
the site in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation .
frequently from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with its naked eye can be seen clearly .
since 2003 , there is something similar to the Plan@@ etary Trail on the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Göttingen .
starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet path leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory as well as an &quot; off @-@ planet &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( community of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf @-@ planet at the end point - are positioned exactly at a distance and a scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun &apos;s exact 75 meters distance measuring just 70 centimet@@ res .
the entire distance of the planet is about four kilometres .
while the light from sun to the Plu@@ to takes about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
so pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in space .
but the march to the next fixed star would last half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council lightweight Champion , went down to Lom@@ ach@@ enko to welcome the World Bo@@ xing Organisation Super Spring weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it to you , champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you a lot of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noted that a possible show@@ down would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I grew up for bronze &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to come down to light weight .
and he must move to light weights &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that demands the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko was right .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
climate mates asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 pound debut this year to schedule a date next summer ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) which also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell following their light weight title fight in the Forum on September 23 .
&quot; this fight could take place in Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode , because all fans asked him , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and later expressed his willingness to fight for the network that offers the best finance package .
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he appreciated Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday combat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko said with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said he thinks the tri@@ athlon champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very slowly , I &apos;m sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the Ko @-@ Off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact strength then boxes .
they both said they could feel the momentum that built up for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four injured after tire bur@@ sting
on Thursday afternoon , four people were seriously injured in an accident on the A@@ 7 .
after first information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control over his vehicle shortly before the end of the market .
the passenger hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ came and then stood on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
during the first care of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service , the A@@ 7 was closed to the north for about one hour , then the traffic on the left side of the road was passed by the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; triple chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes after the 2 : 2 season kick @-@ off against Braunschweig , that the optimisation of the defence formation in Au@@ e scored points .
with the first season of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the result as well , because not the two ad@@ versaries would have been against Braunschweig at 2 : 2 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to be better in au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defense player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the triple chain is to be further optimised .
and a gate after a kick @-@ off , the For@@ tun@@ as don &apos;t want to catch up anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , it will be that no one else besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) will be on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his crew is better able to cope with the triple chain after the experience in preparation , than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; yet I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we have just in the triple chain on the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ aan and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann , who can build up well , &quot; Hoffmann said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we harmon@@ ize even better and we do not make so many back@@ lash errors in the setup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann returns to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can talk about a failed start , you don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we can stand with four points on Sunday and can focus on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a decent season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his coach didn &apos;t want to know about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I judge the start of the season only after six to eight days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be stopped pre@@ mat@@ urely because of a storm . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her because they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete play like Fort@@ una against a promotion favorite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they do not know exactly where they are at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Defence Secretary of the Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the visitors from the Rhin@@ eland are going to be a little favourite on Sunday in the meeting in the finally ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we sweep them away only because we are entitled to come under the first six is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games is quite positive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga which you have to beat from the start , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as Chief Executive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meeting such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Funk@@ el doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum application review published
the recent findings of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , who have undergone a new method for assessing their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested individuals are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authorities for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( Medic@@ inal Pharmac@@ ies ) have started the tests last year .
during the asylum process , they should make the assessment of age more precise after the Swedish Migration Bureau ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) was critici@@ zed for errors in judging the correct age of some refugees that were minor .
until today , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were evaluated as 18 or older while in 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion that the person is &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are only performed in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Go@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the figures are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases where the person was judged for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases suggest@@ ing that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot;
when the paper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det examined the results published in 5@@ 81 , she found out that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical retirement , in which X @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was also critici@@ zed in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of humans to see whether they used to go through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to judge the biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we can &apos;t say it for sure , we shouldn &apos;t do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generally , you can say that the risk of a child as an adult is in@@ accurate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the plan
the works on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are proceeding well .
on Wednesday , a seven @-@ ton concrete section was installed on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it runs fine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Construction Manager at the Traffic and Transport department at the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April the works started at the same time on all three bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the end of the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule will be met .
the first bridge coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a concrete arch bridge made of concrete , which is cla@@ d with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to guarantee the stability and the stability of the road , the three buildings are now thoroughly re@@ developed .
the two other bridges lead over Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , or 10.@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach was now on Wednesday mor@@ nings on the north side a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bridge cap .
this is a marginal fixing that is also used as operating distance .
on Friday , a 2.@@ 20 @-@ meter wide bridge can be used on the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is supposed to be gone .
the special thing about this is that it concerns finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented brid@@ ging caps .
special t@@ act feeling has necess@@ itated laying cables through the structure in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable where many companies are connected .
local residents were informed in advance of the work by hand@@ outs on the project .
in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish first had to be f@@ ished off .
for the bridges between the building yard and the collecting pond in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg the traffic is lane @-@ lane by a traffic light .
for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully closed .
the cost of the three bridges amounts to 700 000 euros .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : under protest with German potato salad
it is not so common that parties pull together , but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to reconci@@ le .
the parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , lef@@ ti@@ sts ) are part of a broad alliance that shows a peaceful flag on this day because the Af@@ D invites R@@ ond@@ ell to the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle in R@@ ond@@ ell for the &quot; great electoral campaign &quot; according to poster .
and well @-@ known names start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land is the leading duo for the German Bundestag election on September 24 , and the deputy chair@@ woman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ lern but demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colourful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally the town picnic under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; was planned on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now takes place on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful picture that offers itself .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chairman of the Forum A World and one of the leading organizers , is really pleased : &quot; great , how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ur@@ inary potato salad , which also the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence especially at the station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ D vul@@ can@@ ic Ei@@ fel reports that he was trying to make such an event and received the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already asc@@ ended Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kirchen , there were not enough parking spaces available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; well the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing is that it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also a band for entertainment at about 8@@ pm , in the Stad@@ thalle there are several speakers , including the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe Jung .
in the hall there are about 200 people waiting for the election of the top candidates for the parliamentary election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy chief of the Federal President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
the police presence remains unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
the Af@@ D @-@ event takes a little more than an hour , the guests at the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but there is also a short time after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can back up - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ concer@@ tos tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the monastery church .
together with the Bulgarian trumpet player Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or also &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ folklore &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in top European orchest@@ ras .
this is Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is solo trumpet player of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both combine the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments , but also to blend the boundaries of the different genres .
Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new garment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; world music &quot; combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; by jazz musician N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free play blend into a fascinating overall art work .
this piece of the program was first performed this spring with a huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster Church with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart openly about their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s coming next ? &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most famous relationship of Hollywood stars was that of her &quot; twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately bitter@@ ly dealt with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in spite of all this , the brun@@ ette act@@ ress ass@@ ures the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was in love with everyone I searched for . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I would have played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after their separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that it was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed in du@@ alism .
so it has never interfer@@ ed or hin@@ dered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I never liked to be taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially among them I suffered as &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z , &quot; but in the school time , when they preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
that really hurt me very much .
when I was eleven the children told me , I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , sc@@ ared and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girls , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the public do not like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you to relate in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ung@@ rat@@ eful &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
governor of West Virginia announced that he changes the party
the Democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of reflections ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demonstration broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; as a coach , I would say that it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a big announcement at the West Virginia R@@ ally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he owns coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime , on Thursday evening , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party which would rather prevent us than working to make our country back great . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 provinces and the least legislative bodies in history , Gover@@ nor Justice &apos;s announcement is only the last rejection of a party that is without leadership from top to bottom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the R@@ NC president Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia on a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in the sport .
Russian Ath@@ le@@ tics Chef D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the World Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships , that his country &apos;s exile from sports was correct and that he was determined to fight against dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who have been cut away gold and silver med@@ als at competitions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF congress agreed to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found evidence on state @-@ supported dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the re@@ porter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized within itself that it has experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think that progress has been made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re @-@ use Russia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the cor@@ rupted system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships on Friday in London following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet some of the criteria for rein@@ statement .
drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still active , he told re@@ porters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
funeral p@@ act for soldiers cut off in Mali
during a funeral service in the North Hes@@ sian Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two soldiers were killed in a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
the Minister of Defence , Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) , said nothing to the un@@ clari@@ fied fall of the fall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they described the two opposite drivers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts of their specialist &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow to this highest sacrifice they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from northern H@@ esse had died on Wednesday a week ago in Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a vi@@ gil of the Bundes@@ wehr into the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Sankt Peter .
at mid@@ day only the relatives of the church took leave .
after that , the funeral service started in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the German army and politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the In@@ spec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mour@@ ns laid down roses , the relatives were arm in arm at the coff@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Defence of the Le@@ yen called the soldiers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sub@@ merged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief captain transpor@@ ters Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volker Bau@@ er@@ sa@@ ch , commander of the regi@@ ment to which the soldiers were , declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this crew could not turn away the crash then nobody would have liked it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doubt on the UN mission in Mali , Minister of the Le@@ yen did not show : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use is dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they were buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave near his wife
the husband of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife .
this was what the Royal House shared on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is added to Ros@@ kil@@ de &apos;s cathedral church .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision , and she stated that she was informed .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried remains unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he wasn &apos;t happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have liked to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he retired in 2016 and also puts the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prince Su@@ pper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equal to his wife - even after his death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the spokes@@ woman of the Danish King &apos;s House , declared .
where the last resting @-@ place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , remains unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years .
born 1965 in London , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ ble@@ man , lived in London .
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French embassy .
during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people were always f@@ lown , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his 50 @-@ year reign with the Dan@@ es .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik spoke about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk str@@ uts instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ l@@ ises I smoked in place of Virginia tobacco and which had the reputation of being the brand of critical intellectual intellectuals , I could not hope for len@@ i@@ ency .
I was different .
I seemed to be content with this position and not to be ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were just two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants quick re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before the possible majority in Lower Saxony
according to the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a swift re @-@ election of the Land@@ tag , Nieder@@ sach@@ sen &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) refuses to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s because on Friday for the resolution of the parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
prior to that , the surprising res@@ ignation of a Green Party de@@ pu@@ ties in Lower Saxony has pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the Land@@ tag election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its close one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the former Gre@@ ens Euro MP El@@ ke T@@ westen explained their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained on Friday in Hannover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
s &amp; D spokesperson on CD@@ U , Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler , wants his group to record her .
thus CD@@ U and F@@ DP together with 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , SPD and Gre@@ ens 68 seats .
so far , the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be elected regular on January 14th next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether it could continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , however , considers it essential that the Parliament will quickly resolve its self @-@ resolution as quickly as possible .
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the parliament withdraw@@ s the trust of the Prime Minister and chooses a successor .
&quot; our constitution offers several options .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these possibilities must be checked legally clean@@ ly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will discuss all questions in peace if they are legally reasonable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ western &apos;s step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something strange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she described herself as a follow@@ er of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called on the res@@ ett@@ led parliam@@ ent@@ arians to return their country &apos;s mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we assume that they have returned to their country parliament , which has received them over the green national list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the country Met@@ a Jans@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group president of the Green Party , Anja P@@ iel , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she has deliberately decided not to take a pron@@ unci@@ ation in the Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the light of the fact that there were no contex@@ tual differences , we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transition of the Dutch Green Party de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behavior of former Gre@@ ens in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chief of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly elect the parliament .
the exit of T@@ west@@ ens costs Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her last vanity and in her fru@@ stration their personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised the SPD Secretary of Hu@@ ber@@ tus Sal@@ vation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is sc@@ andal@@ ous that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony brings this dirty intri@@ gue and tries to strike political capital out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

agriculture Minister in an interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ si@@ es , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany discusses inf@@ ested eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
agricultural Minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr. Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers to check the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp pressure .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ Lebensmittel@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states submit the latest information about the affected eggs bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if , according to all we currently know , health haz@@ ards are practically excluded .
is Al@@ di now taking over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs from the offer - because the central role of the educ@@ ator is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , my house has opened up immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany &apos;s sad@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all information and risk assessments are available to consumers .
the trade has the same responsibility as the makers to ensure that the products sold are market@@ able and harmless to health .
if the residual hardness level of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , they are not transfer@@ able .
un@@ loaded eggs can , however , be sold and consumed .
this time the factories are not to blame .
are production plants and consumers in the same boat ?
as far as knowledge is concerned , the production plants do not have immediate fault .
rather , they have to expect economic damages due to presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies .
as always , there is too little control in the serious case .
is it only lacking in staff or in conclu@@ sive competence ?
it was just the official controls that revealed the process .
the truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent ruled out .
precisely because of this , a consequ@@ ent clari@@ fication of such events and the transfer to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in cases where criminal off@@ ences can be present are of decisive importance .
I have already made it clear several times that I expect a complete explanation from the responsible authorities .
is regular al@@ arms really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers have the right to get only safe and market@@ able foods .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an un@@ authorised insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly disgu@@ sted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the pan@@ elled means manufacturers , dealers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ to @-@ food animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately .
this has to be done consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
I expect the competent authorities to clear the facts quickly and comprehen@@ sively .
how the financial rules of football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered expenditure of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will still come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UEF@@ A , as the executive organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to prohi@@ bit teams from gaining access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G has to prove that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without significant losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million US dollars ) to purchase the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
PS@@ G can certainly make the money loose so that N@@ ey@@ mar under@@ takes and brings him to a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the wealthy master family of Qatar .
clubs are not allowed to spend a lot of money for the purchase of players , but must be subject to legitimate revenue sources that allow them to break the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success were effectively dec@@ ei@@ ving and ris@@ king to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentrating on the debts of clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model that Roman Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a harder affair .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P publishing period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen out of favour by the Pres@@ i@@ dency in 2015 , his successor , Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , continues to be deter@@ red by excessive spending .
&quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for the accounting period over the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract so that the debt recovery will be reported for the next five years amoun@@ ting to 4@@ 4,@@ 4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 brought the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of EUR 60 million ( at that time $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs who could try to out@@ wit their financial view by infl@@ ating their income by companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a Catalan company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not allow this to be regarded as legitimate in@@ comes .
this is exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the P@@ SA sponsor@@ ship was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come to Qatar via payments from the World Cup 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 insi@@ sted that N@@ ey@@ mar won the World Cup ambassador and could easily find out such a maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to observe any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , announ@@ cing on Thursday the people who were familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not competent to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million with a turnover of EUR 54@@ 2.4 million .
accounts for the last fiscal year need to be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dising and jer@@ sey sales .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signing of the contract .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players and tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s move by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president of La Liga , Ja@@ vier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American sport @-@ ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state financed by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it becomes very difficult to respect the financial fair Fair@@ play because you can have different paths or have different interests if a country has such a major player to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new automotive supplier
in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has made board chocolate for Swiss .
now there is a close cooperation in front of a possible end : the airline is re@@ writing the order .
Swiss spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; Northern Switzerland &quot; of Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to a quality control .
&quot; we are very happy with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokes@@ woman .
around 17 million small red @-@ and @-@ white chocolate chips to 14 grams distribute the flight atten@@ d@@ ants to the passengers before landing .
Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; North West Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros @-@ subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but important is the advertising effect once and for all : it is a prestigious order for a chocolate manufacturer .
Swiss will not want to reveal how many applicants are involved in the new tender .
but only Swiss manufacturers come into question .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the contract beyond the spring of 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not achiev@@ able for a comment .
Swiss Life has been distributing chocolate panels on board its flights since 2006 .
before the Swiss signed a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has delivered the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hu@@ g .
Swiss two and a half years ago , Swiss led the company to start the cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline is co@@ operating with various Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ haul flights customers of the First Class will be treated with goo@@ dies by the Spr@@ ün@@ gli Con@@ fis@@ erie , in Business Class passengers Sho@@ gg@@ i from Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
even on the short circuit Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i distri@@ butes by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and economy class .

nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic for the glorious days of the 80s characters , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge era ( when the think@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ etch comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as a fran@@ chise it feels like time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd humour ( it contained an original story for a talking tin vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by star@@ ing at the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play great children who are grown up - still creating the im@@ possibility to regain the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes beyond the watering principle , among them a riff on the Stal@@ ker movies of the 90 @-@ year @-@ olds such as &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le . &quot;
at one point , a character goes through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the lovely C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now the novel@@ ist , has never forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Mar@@ ino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy evil plot that Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) is involved , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , ex@@ ams are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
it &apos;s especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s side@@ burns of &quot; Sing@@ les &quot; whose former Big Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy .
it is the moments of random ma@@ dness that could fuel this fran@@ chise like a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches that which I suppose as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose final scene will show the band how they will attend the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and even to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its east versus west w@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comedy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka is to be a found TV show : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ vo@@ v Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ eph - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alo@@ gues by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt are du@@ bbed in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to look at ( the police spend the time watching chess on TV , as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent play &apos; Find the voice out &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ ag@@ an mask is involved - that it often plays like a single . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are six long episodes , and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was edited on a shorter length , could better deliver its ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , because Gregor and I@@ os@@ eph always visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary communist public is that Western culture can do everything to feed for a money .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian authors were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
strike against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police have succeeded in a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday mor@@ nings in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects were searched .
at the same time , 15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
in addition , the officials ensured large quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundreds of thousands of Euros .
in the case of time @-@ like ra@@ ids in Italy two persons were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Italian , there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two are therefore presumably extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investigations were involved in the action .
a total of more than 300 polic@@ emen were deployed .
the members of the Ma@@ fia have accused of organised drug crime , serious violence , attempted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating the drug traffi@@ cking in southern Germany .
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo , there was a lively exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
this was the reason why the big deployment on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
the aim of the investigations was to identify Italian citizens with close relation to the Italian ma@@ fia .
also a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the band &apos;s account .
Weise lam@@ bs large gaps in the for@@ eigner @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data of citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the for@@ eigner &apos;s register shows considerable short@@ com@@ ings in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has drawn attention to large gaps in the ali@@ ens polic@@ ing register .
short@@ com@@ ings in the registered data could lead to &quot; partly serious mis@@ decisions &quot; in case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , warned in an analysis of the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung ) .
according to data , ten million people with foreign citizenship are reported in the register , including around 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore administered by approximately 600 immigration authorities in Germany .
because the data had not been properly maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good so far .
in some cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; of people who are no longer alive , or by citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faulty data inputs can slow down processes considerably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , in statistics on sufficient people there are EU citizens who do not have to travel abroad at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such false attri@@ butions , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; led to a distorted debate on dealing with sufficient tax@@ pa@@ yers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year old children if they have arrived from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this paper , it says that &quot; BA@@ MF is carrying out such procedures &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper referred to the difficult situation on the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement , it is responsible for refugees from the EU state to reach it first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a migrant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the country of travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Office now writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased substantially . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has given guarantees for housing and housing of families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .
other EU countries would also send refugees back there as part of the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the domestic political spokes@@ woman of the Left Fra@@ ction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children threaten un@@ lawful reception conditions and a danger to child welfare because of the defici@@ encies in the Italian asylum system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach had already provided the blood donation service for other people .
at least by the twelve citizens who were honoured on Friday .
one of them is Jürgen Gre@@ ul , who with his 100 donations in the meantime shared 50 litres of blood .
traditionally , in the council &apos;s meeting , the congregation acknow@@ le@@ dges the multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is awesome how our body is designed for it and we pay tribute to the don@@ ors who make their blood available to strangers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the coordinator of the German Red Cross ( DRC ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the preserved foods are de@@ composed into their constitu@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three people could already benefit from a blood donation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mais@@ enb@@ acher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported on the actions carried out in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach in the spring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K district administrator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the change to the theatre house has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago .
previously , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ beer counted among the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 donated blood donations each .
half as many book Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Lock@@ eh , Stef@@ an@@ ie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter average ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of their juice .
the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged , after weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened the spec@@ ulations of an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it kept interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with less members expected to increase in this month as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase .
in its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % and by 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on budget@@ ary income would continue , with inflation likely to rise to almost 3 % in the autumn .
but it sign@@ aled that in the next few years interest rates would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation that was heated by the Bre@@ x@@ it and it said that the cost of bor@@ rowing might need to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw part of the mamm@@ oth business cycle , which was issued a year ago after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks in February , although it has been said that it will now be expected to make 15 billion pounds more available within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forec@@ asting of the M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the interest rates , it repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be necessary for cooling down inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat greater &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magnitude than the markets expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts for this year and next year are expected to be 1.9 % and 1.7 % in May .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound was compared with the dollar and the euro .
the pound was down 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision on no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations on a rise in interest rates and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months has increased to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will easily recover after the Bank at the end of the year .
the latest inflation forecast showed little enthusiasm for households who are affected by rising inflation and minor increases in wages , as the tigh@@ tening is first even worse before it gets better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy in the coming years cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but added that wages are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significantly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also boo@@ sted by the rising demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak Po@@ und , which will offset a portion of lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes a year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in August following the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the fall of the fund .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s final judgment on interest rates , the call for interest rates rose because inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three policy makers in July demanding an increase to 0.5 % .
inflation fell from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said this was expected and will be re @-@ tigh@@ tening in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said the excess in proportion to its target of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , director of Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the recent decline in Swa@@ p rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , as the len@@ ders look lou@@ dly for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market is particularly good for those in which the existing deals are exp@@ iring and the new mort@@ g@@ ages are fin@@ alised , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is to prescri@@ be a controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment after a fight in front of the High Court against the financing of the drug in the N@@ HS .
N@@ HS England announced that a pre@@ text pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic ( pre@@ p ) taken prior to sexual intercourse ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now supplied by health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the process after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed last year &apos;s ruling that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p in spite of the claim that local authorities should finance it .
the chess suit announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England CEO Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as the &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to permit the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ text pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV medications taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission to infectious diseases .
pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough medication in the body of a person is present to prevent an HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
among those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been treated successfully .
in hospitals , suitable participants will be identified who agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people living in England and registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following international competitive sourcing .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This major new intervention should complement and over@@ haul the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in cop@@ ing with one of mankind &apos;s greatest health challenges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pre@@ p , if targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people , it is possible to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV @-@ risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded experiment in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , President of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now be to ensure that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine was procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Minister of Health , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delays and hes@@ it@@ ancy by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug may be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected and that they will contribute to the termination of the dis@@ sem@@ ination of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , decreased in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger space , &quot; Jo@@ anne says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I looked for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that was my requirement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively in order to solve the issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend over . &quot; &quot; &quot;
not only was it possible to build a simple platform , but to place the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with lots of additional drama .
a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area for the mezzanine .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ tain lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends a short corridor is mirr@@ ored in order to make it work for a longer time .
in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all the cutlery and j@@ ars of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
folding kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering went inside , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s very important , so if you push the door very easily . &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on soil size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to increase the floor space while using high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxury advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that touch you and therefore help create emotional ties in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not love the electrical outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself by a good design and an increased square meter of some standard into something quite amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them .
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a dispute because of one of the biggest real estate empire of Victori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the Carl@@ ton Football Club and developer Col@@ in De LU@@ TI@@ S lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul .
Paul wanted to reti@@ re from family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the Brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars since the 1973 family bought a shop at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there , the West@@ co family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
this money was invested in real estate and the De LU@@ TI@@ S portfolio now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in - by Paul described as the &quot; principal operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De LU@@ TI@@ S family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a court file says that this means that Col@@ in has assets worth $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul worth $ 17@@ 6 million .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the divisions suggested by Col@@ in have left him with what I considered the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed plac@@ ements , the Supreme Court hearing took place .
the brothers now also struggle for control over the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but appeals to Paul to manage some possessions in@@ competent .
in an early aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian inheritance tells us that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs rise in the case with hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both sides held law firms .
Mrs. De LU@@ TI@@ S and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy and delic@@ at@@ essen shops from the late 1950 &apos;s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early 1970 &apos;s .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property where Col@@ in opened the first je@@ an shop of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in says he started when he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anna De LU@@ TI@@ S says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to give her property back to her sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land on trial , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De LU@@ TI@@ S group , whereas Col@@ in claims that Mark has been paid 10 million dollars while leaving the company and Luke 26 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Luke and Mark are , thus Paul says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has become bitter about the conditions of their financial division . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in with@@ held back very much , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from 2015 Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the television star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De LU@@ TI@@ S and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in replied by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case was before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; he wrote .
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end in our current fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , adding that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our matter will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the pres@@ idents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; media abst@@ in@@ ence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House aims to limit the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including reports of the news media - in the hope of keeping the head on a more consistent course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with senior officers on his first day of work , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump White House : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad information coming into the hands of the President . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kell@@ ys &apos;s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by monitoring his media diet .
President Tr@@ ump Rel@@ ation@@ ship to TV extends back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when candidate Tr@@ ump was anno@@ yed because of unfair exposure , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs that were to be persu@@ aded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election campaign advis@@ er Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February of Poli@@ tico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Politi@@ co Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keeping s@@ ling@@ ing s@@ lows under control , according to six former election campaig@@ ners , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay . that &apos;s okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that s@@ ling@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe these campaign officers know something we don &apos;t know - that , without their interventions , tr@@ umps would have included even more fuel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that has not sent the dump .
if his employees managed to keep him away from him for a while , their efforts paid off .
but no one has consistently prevented Tr@@ ump controversy .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , consisting of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting the material that possibly promotes their views from the world .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the consultant to provide the President for strategic reasons doub@@ t@@ ful information .
this was an example described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can react like a volcano to negative press releases , especially those with damaging le@@ aks , and that he can find out where they originate from .
this was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone mali@@ ci@@ ously issued a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for har@@ ass@@ ment or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has sold false accus@@ ations in the past and has rev@@ oked them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and began asking people about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gold@@ smith added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the General Secretary of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work , which will get the dump . &quot;
how did this work ?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his consultants are still striving for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most sought @-@ after criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped for .
the police all over Europe sent postcards to dangerous criminals in this summer ( virtual ) postcards .
as the addresses of the most sought @-@ after gravity criminals are not known in nature , references from the population will be hoped and requested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday of the promotion following the winter &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences would have shown that many fle@@ eting of holiday destinations are hiding , called it by Euro@@ pol .
21 Post@@ cards for the sought @-@ after criminals from 21 EU countries have been compiled .
since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times .
36 of the online gestures could be arrested so far , at least eleven of them on the basis of evidence after publication on the website .
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire Series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some resol@@ ute travelers on the feet of war who have negotiated a dit@@ ch pulled by the municipality to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside of a wealthy street of Soli@@ hull , called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Million@@ aire Series &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have brought horses , babies and an army of v@@ ans after they were thrown out in May , without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council to prevent their attacks .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull to say that it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they moved there on Monday evening after they were sent on by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones onto the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Council must , by means of shame , be forced into action as it was useless when dealing with the problem .
the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are back now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more came yesterday evening , probably even more today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long sub@@ missions to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my local charge if the Council cannot even stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an locals who didn &apos;t want to be named said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last round of these travellers just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the Soli@@ hull Council said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and cooperate with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to move them forward as soon as possible .
to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must review when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof , Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise will be from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re @-@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closing of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof through the then Ambiente company company l@@ t@@ d. on April 13 , 2014 some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also recei@@ pts by the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the district , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers from setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the municipal council .
but above all Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and even then spoke of serious interested parties at the house .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els with managing director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three @-@ star @-@ plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you will find Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof , building sch@@ utt@@ les have been standing in front of the entrance for some time , and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are carried out .
the floors were pulled out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs are removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it &apos;s actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should later become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pretty bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer push@@ es out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and conference room belong to the facilities .
one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale downtown level , Sch@@ erer emphasizes .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms , wants to spread wide , explains Sch@@ erer .
individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he has already held talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause , the Sch@@ erer .
the ideas of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
when the investment is high , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to specify exactly .
he reck@@ ons just under one million euros .
the external systems are also brought forward , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , there is a large terrace , which will be accessible from the restaurant , which is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : U.S. special investig@@ ator sets out Grand Jury
in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special gene@@ alog@@ ist Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent weeks , the committee has recorded the work , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with respect to the people entrusted to them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the newspaper pointed out the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller extended and intensified his investigation .
the channel CN@@ N reported that there were already the first invitations of the committee in connection with a meeting between the s@@ cour@@ ge of oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time , pur@@ pos@@ efully interven@@ ing in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were agreements between the election campaign team and Moscow .
in the focus of the investigations , several men are to stand , who acted as advis@@ ors to the re@@ public@@ ans in the election campaign .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also examined more and more tr@@ umps in a private and business environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Agent has personally put Tr@@ ump into the centre and susp@@ ects whether the President may have obstruc@@ ted the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jury is to examine present evidence in possible cases of crime and to decide whether it should be charged .
Grand Jur@@ gies are therefore also called to be indic@@ ted .
mostly they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor to invite people to interro@@ g@@ ating under oath .
according to the CN@@ N , invitations were issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were called upon to testify , called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , also the s@@ ling@@ ers consultant and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his former election campaign manager Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were involved in the conversation .
legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the exposure showed that Mu@@ eller would not be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that if necessary , he wanted to act quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the elevation of an indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of new revelations , on Thursday evening , the president used a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the theme gives the Democrats a way to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor , T@@ y Cob@@ b , stated in a statement that he did not know about the establishment of a Grand Jury .
but this usually works in secret , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advoc@@ ates any action that acceler@@ ates the work of the special promot@@ er in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ways . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that not be determined against the president .
I have no reason to assume that something has changed , it says further in the statement .
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this rule , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump had been lou@@ dly lou@@ dly , he would obstruc@@ t the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Com@@ ey said in June of a sen@@ ate committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to stop the investigation against the national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
after the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special issu@@ er and his employees .
this triggered speculation as to whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to release .
unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later retired President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the ur@@ ging of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators issued bills on Thursday , after which the Special Issu@@ er could no longer be released as easily as possible .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : giant ic@@ e@@ berg prop@@ els in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the western Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg has been solved by the narrow@@ ly seven @-@ fold size of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
this was confirmed by the Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the Kol@@ oss , which weighs more than one tri@@ l@@ lion tonnes and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , now travel north@@ wards and will probably need two or three years until it is melted .
with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered in the last three decades .
there is no danger for people .
according to research information , the extent to which climate change has played a role in the demo@@ lition of the ice age is unclear .
but overall there have been a series of unusual break@@ downs in the region for around 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a factor background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus was a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by big glaci@@ ers .
it is growing ever further into the sea and breaks regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this ice shelf the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ rupt was dis@@ rupted a few years ago .
a complete hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e is broken there , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e file is in danger , because the front edge has never been as far removed as it is now .
in addition , the iron plate is under tension and can fall apart , if a piece breaks down on a key site .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase the sea level because they float on the water and ice as much water as it results after the melting .
however , the loss of the ice shelf causes the glaci@@ ers to flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase sea level , but only in a small degree , the British research project writes to the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antar@@ c@@ tica with nearly 50,000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the wi@@ dest withdrawal since the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists , whether Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s will grow back or fall back in the long term and possibly fall together , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even if these researchers did not return the abor@@ tion of this giant ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , many king@@ f@@ ishers of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have collap@@ sed in recent decades .
this long tip of the Antar@@ ctic stretches towards South America .
according to the British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the Antar@@ ctic Survey &apos;s ice surface has decreased by 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the rise in temperature contributed to the decline .
over the past 50 years , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees and thus t@@ ames into the areas where the temperature is fastest steep .
CD@@ U wants a ho@@ ur@@ ly rate at the staff
because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U demands to stand out of the Emplo@@ yers &apos; Association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous Day has established 41 new positions in the administration .
more than 1,@@ 100 employees and officials work for the administrative district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have left their first day of work .
the teaching positions in the circle are obviously much sought after .
there were around 6@@ 20 applications for the places to be awarded this year .
however , the group still lacks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
at present there are 50 vac@@ ancies at the M@@ ett@@ mann district .
among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as the powers of general administration .
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and to counter the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the administration should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is not only to cover short @-@ term demand for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application shortage .
the overall concept should orient@@ ate itself internally and extern@@ ally , show concrete measures for cross @-@ entry and include a training initiative , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems that one did not know before .
other cities recru@@ it good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , there is a high number of employees who retired due to illness or age related reasons .
so it is time to act so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Roth , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common motion with his party .
he had long since made a la@@ zy surprise in the county , when he publicly challenged personnel expenses and stun@@ ned the other parties .
people want all possibilities to be reviewed which enable ex@@ iting from the communal employers &apos; association .
&quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term , the administration of the county with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - should aim at a ho@@ ur@@ ly rate , &quot; says peoples .
in doing so , the CD@@ U , the employees and officials , is trying to pay better than it actually envis@@ ages the tari@@ ff bill for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money only exist when switching to a higher level , which is oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle grew more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up , in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Protection Act .
not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Coun@@ cill@@ or Thomas Hend@@ ele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too few staff .
Italy exac@@ erb@@ ates the tone of NGOs &apos; rescue boats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use ba@@ il@@ out boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they must not continue this unless they comply with new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new Code of Con@@ duct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ne@@ tis &apos;s warning came a day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat from the German aid organization &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their squ@@ ad had worked effectively with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to express its views on the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Carto@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , saving human life remains our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue area at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only assess any accus@@ ations currently raised after collecting all the information and assessing the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; who supervised I@@ u@@ vent@@ a since October .
it is thought that its crew takes din@@ gh@@ y migrants aboard , which are supplied to them directly by human traffi@@ ckers , and that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can go off so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s file whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of over@@ throwing the authority of the Italian Co@@ ast@@ guard , the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ v@@ entr@@ a must have an Italian police officer on board , who supervis@@ es their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable as they would not bring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Prize @-@ winning organisation is Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minn@@ iti has meanwhile said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures had declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who left these countries hope to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; &quot; &quot; nine wil@@ low bi@@ kers , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and two guest drivers met at Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North Pal@@ at@@ inate , to enjoy Tri@@ als and sights for four days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were three friendly guides available .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est from Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ chapel above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
observation points followed , partly on towers , from which one could look far above the P@@ fäl@@ zer@@ wald forest and the up@@ stream layers .
in between there were always longer climbs , for which long tri@@ als were rewarded .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and to the Wur@@ st@@ markt folk festival .
again , there was a look@@ out spot at the look@@ out , connected by &quot; flew &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
during the last two days a lot of al@@ timet@@ ers were announced .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and shel@@ ters brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed healing br@@ ine in the open air inhal@@ atorium .
new town was also controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 meters of altitude , the group had met the P@@ fäl@@ zer@@ wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally .
console instead of grass - Bundes@@ liga is equi@@ pping itself for E @-@ Sport
are the sports stars sitting in front of computer consoles in the future , instead of being weather@@ ed by wind and weather over the stadium lawn ?
fact is : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious industry , a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high ga@@ its included .
these have also recognized the first federal li@@ ga@@ des who are increasingly involved in this field .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 followed and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire completely new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several clubs are climbing on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Cup organis@@ es the first &quot; Interactive club World Cup , &quot; in which the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other .
besides Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen currently advises an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds in particular , that young people still go to the stadium in the future , &quot; said the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the clubs were trying to conquer all sorts of markets , especially the Asian ones .
with prominent e @-@ athletes under the contract they could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the Bundes@@ lig@@ am@@ nes@@ ian to Asia .
what is it all about ?
at E @-@ Sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike , &quot; or the FIFA World Cup will be fought at a competitive level .
as in normal sport , le@@ agues have long since become established , in which the pros compete against each other .
and for the Asian Games in 2022 , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official programme .
but is it really a real sport ?
for many , the performance is certainly getting used to the ordinary .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ous has also dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the German Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , e @-@ sports is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions , which can also be found in classical sports - for example , increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
it also requires cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding and a rapid re@@ activity .
professional gam@@ ers should train not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to the nutrition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the itte player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ rob@@ ous also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more an issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls should be difficult to perform in online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing .
the scientist emphas@@ ises the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport in a positive way .
the players are internationally on the road , that &apos;s like a big global family , there are no intercultural barriers .
a study by the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been put into practice in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ship and major tournaments .
in three years , turnover is expected to be 130 million .
this is little against the 2.4 billion euro of the Bundes@@ liga .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ Sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Del@@ o@@ itte &apos;s consultants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
internationally , many countries are already on the move .
great markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and basketball star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez join the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport @-@ bet@@ ting provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is a lot happening in Europe as well .
in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sport has been introduced as a class of instruction , says F@@ rob@@ ous .
according to D@@ utt , the Netherlands and France are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; Germany la@@ gs behind in the European comparison , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B executive vice @-@ president R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann .
to decay only in nostal@@ gia and to clear the old times is no longer enough today .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company with the modern market at the same time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ zed world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no proof that only football remains as it always was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Car@@ ter convic@@ ted of the texts that Con@@ rad Roy forcing to commit suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide .
Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months in prison and five years have been exposed to prob@@ ation .
Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted in June for negligence of Con@@ rad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his appointment .
she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy did suffer from mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter was standing with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and downward pointing eyes when she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life in order to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she showed no repentance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters attorney said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that she depl@@ ores . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Ju@@ dge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find out that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity level &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , saying that there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no day in which I am not mour@@ ning the loss of my beloved son . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I change with everything . I try to be there for his sisters in spite of all my pain that we will carry with us for eternity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roy &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , stated that she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the realization that she would never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or would be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer have this single person , with whom I was together every day since my birth , is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent since there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a car in 2014 .
the case drew national attention , after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang on , spring from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments of his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said Car@@ ter looked for attention by the death of Roy and ordered that it should benefit from any press from the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few who defended Car@@ ter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted in 2007 for murder of her British co @-@ worker in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ ens : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ ti of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ i was allowed to run on the Audi Cup as captain is not a coincidence .
the FC Bayern will take a big season of the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner - extra motivation does not harm .
something was different on his place in the cabin , that Joshua Kim@@ i saw immediately , even though the additional piece of clothing was very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er were to be seen , he made the rush to his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner after his first deployment as a Bavarian captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good , the entry could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but Kim@@ i could interpret the sign from the coach .
not the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen as a game leader in the C @-@ el@@ f who had come from youth , de@@ but@@ ants and just from vacation .
sugar is best distributed to those who want to get a lot of ingredients that you want to keep in a good mood .
those who have been chosen to compete for the heritage of Lah@@ ti can only use a little extra motivation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kim@@ i confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old ran a mini @-@ lam@@ m across the field .
at the right rear , that is his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did the rest .
and in general Kim@@ i worked in this formation as the one who can take the helm in his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ rehear@@ sed trou@@ pe .
he had the sight for the whole while many others were occupied with themselves .
V@@ idal &apos;s inability to over@@ play his missing fitness ( did not fold ) ; Ren@@ ato is trying to get out of the performance of the Asia trip ( folded up too ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Su@@ le don &apos;t have to neg@@ atively impact on their first appearance in the Bav@@ arians Trio .
after all , it worked out quite well .
in addition to Kim@@ i , Ru@@ dy was running in front of the defense , both acted sovereign .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and in addition , the sw@@ amp tried a few times in the game structure .
his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result was &quot; not as we have hoped for . &quot;
but he also showed good performance at the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game shift , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style , I was also fet@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as unusual this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the newcom@@ ers , one saw in the connection to the game .
Ru@@ dy , for example , did not give one or two interviews in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but certainly six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ i said good bye in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard from the South an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s going on here , I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bavaria , you just have to win every game . &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new .
Al@@ aba motiv@@ ates Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our Ö@@ F@@ B ladies

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ sing Tempo
it was often unfor@@ giving , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this shows itself after more than a year in which the new economic minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region refer to T V demand from a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Enterprises ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the desires of the economy , the Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nat@@ us sees the biggest down@@ turn in infrastructure policy : the gap between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
this year , the ministry hopes for a planning approval process , until 2021 is expected to be due to construction law .
a role in the plans of the country is also played by the West@@ um@@ geh@@ ammer Trier , which stands in the urgent need of the federal transport plan .
the goal is to put the track into operation in December 2020 , says Minist@@ eri@@ ums@@ erin Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
nat@@ us sees it as a sign@@ post to support regional but internationally competing companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier , as suggested by Wis@@ sing , aims at the wine of a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ Label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German exports which have been sack@@ ed for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company , the Chamber of Commerce pra@@ ises .
in the new Master Bonus the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1,000 euros is planned for the passed master test and 2500 Euros if graduates are self @-@ employed within ten years of the Master &apos;s degree .
the home@@ work list for the country remains however long .
with the planned road construction , facts can be quickly created , but at the same time the country lacks the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) .
so far , only 29 jobs have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to hire bis@@ sing in the field of mobility .
the Chamber of Industry calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
the CD@@ U Group vice @-@ president Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf points out calculations of the host , the country will invest more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of regional roads in 2017 and 2018 .
in addition , Frank nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
the current broad@@ band expansion in the country is also sober@@ ing .
in 2016 , regional companies had only evaluated the supply of power in an I@@ HK survey with a score of 3.4 .
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant internet connections and break@@ downs .
ex @-@ Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and sits on the Supervisory Board of the Wind@@ kraft@@ liner Pro Wind .
the Green faction left Lem@@ ke in April to become the president of a private university in Karlsruhe , where after four months of dis@@ agreement , the field already cleared up the field .
Audi should change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face an opposite reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
the BMW president said that &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - prohi@@ bit or limit diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described enterprises as recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the cost of autom@@ akers to install exhaust f@@ umes from diesel vehicles is also increasing , making it difficult to keep the cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of mi@@ tig@@ ating the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
companies are trying to avoid the failures of Volkswagen , using so @-@ called sealing tools that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but driving back in normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were indic@@ ted and others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former Head of Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in Audi &apos;s engine development in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circum@@ vent emissions legislation in Europe , and a request that was focused on the United States has been expanded .
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributed dispro@@ portion@@ ately to Volkswagen &apos;s win .
this message has the raft on Saturday at Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft ride through Munich on Saturday , which has a special message .
if you go to the Is@@ ar again on Saturday , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ b@@ ach@@ brücke .
and that is not a usual raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the building department wants to clear up .
on the raft you can see a large amount of information .
it shows a mil@@ ler mountain .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to a publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... the understanding of the Is@@ ar is to shar@@ pen as a sensitive wild river . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer the raft sailed over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior .
Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ asen and the laughter against the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo has been one of the most widely publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ ons of carto@@ ons , and the n@@ oses of his characters are his trademarks .
also 85 shows the Argent@@ ine@@ an and works on a film .
his message : laughter , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first few years as an artist he proposed himself as a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for greetings cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said once . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after stations in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came in at the end of the 60 &apos;s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then also in the &quot; Stern , &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo characters rom@@ p in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own specifications , he still sits at the drawing table , working daily nearly ten hours .
on cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches , his dro@@ ll figures continue to find a lot of dis@@ sem@@ ination worldwide .
for six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his figures .
the main character in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los &apos;s most popular animal in his drawings , which has a jack of thousands as oppos@@ ers .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie that is supposed to come on the screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they &apos;re saying , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
this is why he rather focuses on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without wor@@ rying .
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence at risk of climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is shr@@ inking because of the conditions that are reminiscent of d@@ rought and due to diseases transmitted diseases , causing scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , great headaches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , an expert of the CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M agricultural research institute in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change that has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the fall .
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is also a small ci@@ ca@@ des , a micro@@ bacterial which transm@@ its d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ des , and in very dry weather there are very many of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there is a lot on the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil attracts not only tourists , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened .
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered are better water distribution and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to d@@ rought .
the town of Gei@@ sa in R@@ hö@@ n is celebrating its 1@@ 200@@ th anniversary this year .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists are discussing what feels more secure : they are supposed to take their children to the office , who were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them home .
security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies .
they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary to submit percep@@ tions and gut feelings .
there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists suspected of standing on the government &apos;s pay@@ roll or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the mess of Mexico dangerous .
there is no resp@@ ite from violence , and while the bodies are pil@@ ing up throughout the country , more and more journalists are in attendance : at least 25 since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to res@@ igned in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are under federal protection after attacks and threats , and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven countries this year .
among the latter is her editor and her inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder of Ja@@ vier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Val@@ dez in one of his many books about violence in connection with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep although his presence is everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two re@@ porters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , trauma , night@@ mares , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a Son@@ der @-@ At@@ tor@@ ney @-@ Office was set up in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , only two criminal proceedings were initiated , according to the Committee on the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders associated with drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime every year , journalists are rarely confronted by journalists .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ comfor@@ ting , even though the terrain is even more tra@@ itor .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why , we all str@@ ust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and was shot 12 times on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ fth River . &quot;
the sho@@ oter ran away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but there is nothing but silence on the topic of Val@@ dez .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in January and the surrender to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields in the country , as rival fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a one or more people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug king@@ doms that are larger than many homes for the living .
&quot; &quot; &quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tranquility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drug trade routes in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken by the fault that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
first there was the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el fac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , gu@@ erri@@ ll@@ as bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was not to force Val@@ dez to leave the country for his own security after the confis@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there .
he served as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined up with five colleagues for the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars in shares .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with time , the newspaper thick@@ ened a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
re@@ porters loved to be able to publish hard @-@ fitting examinations with no fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to deal with .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her reporting in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee on the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in pursuit of Mexican drug history , wherever she was leading .
he gave up voluntarily that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ e@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take over the task you are listening to as a journalist - either that or you &apos;re playing the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What did you do in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who could cur@@ b like a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Was his love for routine destruction ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their work best and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret starting and landing ways &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
to trust his own instinc@@ ts .
if it smells wrong , stay away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sm@@ ell a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing happened with Ja@@ vier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the space where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , no cell@@ phones suddenly were allowed . days earlier it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is exclusively sold to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a middle class neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen , who the Gover@@ nor himself described as un@@ trust@@ worthy .
it is months since the re@@ porters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are actually under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has spent three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of former well @-@ known Ju@@ lio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ poses on state expendi@@ tures focusing on the home town of the Gover@@ nor .
and there was a group going through one of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an &apos;s most expensive restaurants , a block away from the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a re@@ porter found out of public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian governed by the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) which ruled almost the whole century all political levels .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ bre cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this place , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military raid .
only a few months earlier , the readers would have viewed the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source of the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we used to have known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slender body . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers to protest against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ apped a few signs and went to a demonstration on the next morning for another journalist on the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is thei@@ rs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; journalists have become lou@@ der throughout the country by writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in organized protests and buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the Val@@ dez case .
during a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day following the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying on journalists and letting them kill because they told the truth .
she has since then asked her to be re@@ arranged by the government because she is worried that her anger viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez said repeatedly that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime , government officials involved and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ different company &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with the organised crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the media group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists and police officers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the kill@@ ings have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by Z@@ et@@ as Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and head@@ phone lay beside her detached head .
some branches have chosen to include the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua , after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava B@@ reach in March .
others continue as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the murder of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ el with an editorial on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home country or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as it seems to the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , ad@@ mits that drug traffi@@ cking scar@@ es him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and that &apos;s why I became a re@@ porter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer as suddenly all their phones began to bu@@ zz .
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with ri@@ vals and security forces near the spa Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate as promised by a number of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the edge of the bro@@ ker@@ age they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone .
the cover page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens how@@ l nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez had a look at the police officers who kept guard to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid at all , they didn &apos;t show it .
under the mighty portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible to the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his footsteps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just remember , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the same day when Ja@@ vier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , albeit a frigh@@ tening .
now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os of a Canadian min@@ er were so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was so well received that they could even find that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said they would have had something of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rest@@ less past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report published in the journal &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; described him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best preserved ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r specimens in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his unbeliev@@ ably well preserved condition has start@@ led researchers that describe it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es are the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he was buried in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 .
he met something that seemed to be out of the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2.500 Po@@ und ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth cl@@ ump@@ y .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you b@@ link only a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r specimens - the Mon@@ a Lisa of Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although it is covered with a arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as a counter @-@ coating , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed us to get better in its surroundings and to avoid its enemies say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million @-@ year @-@ old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta Mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours discovering it carefully .
the astonishing conservation of the print allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its under@@ side .
although the counter @-@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds the animals living today .
it points out that the din@@ osau@@ r was driven by enough pressure by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution fav@@ oured the conce@@ al@@ ment of the confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or sh@@ ing@@ les - are much smaller and vulnerable than loo@@ t , which sign@@ alizes that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong predat@@ or behaviour on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period must have been , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to examine the animal for clu@@ es about his life , including his preserved intestinal content to find out what he has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the se@@ abed .
at that time Alber@@ ta was as warm as South fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably widespread far inland than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin , but remains preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal , &quot; Brown said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just squ@@ int a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is sleeping . &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period was a time when huge ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his frigh@@ tening ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons wei@@ ght@@ less monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta has sun@@ k after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he was buried on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
according to the museum , it is the best preserved din@@ osau@@ r in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that prot@@ ru@@ ded from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were washed ash@@ ore by western Canada , until a flooded river flooded into the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r preserved his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the Hau@@ st@@ alli@@ ons still cover b@@ ump@@ y tank plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as &apos; rare as a win in the lot@@ tery .
the more I look at it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y tank plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right foref@@ oot is on his side , his five fingers are spread upwards .
I can count the scales at his sole . &quot;
in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are wrapped up in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , long legs and G@@ aff@@ er .
about 20 people were injured on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) on Thursday afternoon at a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
according to the first information of the police , between the outlets of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) there were nearly 30 vehicles during a thunder@@ storm , including trucks .
at first , no information is available about the exact number of injured persons .
a police spokes@@ man said it was light to moderate injuries .
a large number of rescue vehicles had been charged at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of Munich , a ten @-@ kilometre @-@ long back@@ stage was formed .
as an A@@ Z re@@ porter reports , it also occurred on the counter @-@ road to massive disabilities - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ gade noted the characteristics of the vehicle hand@@ le@@ bars , which now have to be reck@@ oned with sensitive pun@@ ishments .
shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident took place on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : nothing similar is sitting in the train and sleeping .
or you are deep@@ ening into his work and has just a brilliant idea .
and then : buff@@ f .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes an uns@@ us@@ p@@ ecting or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket inspection .
you simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your seat and use it to vali@@ date your ticket .
currently , a test operation operates on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the offer arrives , we will expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be expected to be available in many other long @-@ distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the train ticket de@@ valuation without conductor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to be able to use it , however , some requirements must be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to have an online ticket - what already most passengers do .
it also has to be purchased via the train , the DB Navig@@ ator app , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway .
last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like this : you get into the train , calling his ticket to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a button for electronic de@@ valuation appears with the test customers .
the train companions receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
if the train companion comes to place at the ticket check in place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with an already paid online ticket .
one can therefore continue to sleep , continue working , keep silent .
&quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to travel relaxed without ticket inspection by our train crew staff , please check the DB navig@@ ator yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , member of the Marketing Bureau of DB long @-@ distance traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often run by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , the ticket controls are among the biggest anno@@ y@@ ances .
because of@@ ten@@ times you have , in any case , one of the fellow travellers not all the documents you need to de@@ valuation online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card is missing or otherwise a document that must be presented .
the result is endless discussions between the train atten@@ dant and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the part or greater room and delays in the control of one &apos;s own tickets and takes the conductor over time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and also only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
additional numbers on the same route have not yet been activated .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; the Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was shaken to its core .
only one day after arriving in New York City , she was sitting in St. Louis Gi@@ or@@ ene on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled across a mail from someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed an 18 year old child , and it &apos;s still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused as nobody else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the hand@@ le @ the@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly being ret@@ we@@ aving on her tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was about to twe@@ eten the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new to them and their community .
she put her cell phone off to return to tweet via people on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive in the evening .
there were photos of police band and people shou@@ ting , and of a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father who bore a shield with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed at which a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another polic@@ eman assured his ri@@ fle saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll kill you ... animals all &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not usual , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remembered her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the type of murder we have used to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this moment I felt ch@@ ills .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and cried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 11@@ pm she picked up her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the subject of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from 11 .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resili@@ ence that exists from the perspective of people living in community and filled the streets to demand answers .
as Fer@@ rel@@ l , with her daughter , who wore a flower @-@ dress and a matching crown , drove to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she was saying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take them away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know and see it and be drawn up in it .
it must be well developed not only activ@@ ism and organisation , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves .
even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience bl@@ at@@ ant racism , she is no different from the next black women &apos;s child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would be doing a bad job to keep them away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived at F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non @-@ accus@@ ation by Offic@@ ers Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined together with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my activ@@ ism completely changed after 9 August , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything has come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later , during an evening demonstration , Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an , she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came into mind : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an has already collabor@@ ated with the co @-@ director , Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt Ins@@ assen .
his engagement took Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years following Brown &apos;s shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me as these people are represented , for so I shall be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ ara &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not a Messiah &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but a community that comes together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; show unexpected personal aspects of Ferr@@ ara &apos;s life as she falls in love with her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ ization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ ara &apos;s story repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 marked the film &quot; Black@@ more Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women have to bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is genu@@ inely maintained by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook that energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no coincidence although it was at the forefront because in a life on these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the rac@@ ist connections between the community and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area it calls home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels committed to this memory , since she went on the road three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we have to love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss bit gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though it hasn &apos;t been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping mall at the southern end of the pedestrian prec@@ inct has been spl@@ itting the population into pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
the topic hardly leaves one cold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the one to the bit gallery says : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be real great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; no human being &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) .
while supporters believe that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , as well as the other businesses benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will ble@@ ed out .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the plot where the farmers market hall stands , where 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
with the start of construction work will be finished .
the Gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - in Bed@@ a @-@ Platz , with the possibility to sit outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sim@@ one Room : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many years we have been shopping almost every week in the farmers market hall . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the rural women always very happy .
we also discovered the but@@ cher shop for us .
we would wish that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
there are also other cities .
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; if direct marketing is located in a market hall in the gallery , the amount of rent is paid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the new project probably won &apos;t be low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what is a shopping basket in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I think that is superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is enough of it in our city .
you can see how many stores here are empty - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a fair weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive .
as you can see , store shops are rented in a shopping mall only by larger companies , as the rentals there are often un@@ sustainable for a retailer .
too bad , special business is almost no longer available and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; wolf F@@ andel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall does not fit together for me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where is the farmers market hall supposed to be during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run , if the bit @-@ gallery actually actually comes .
or does the gh@@ ost@@ ly bit Galerie manage to sell all the shops from Bit@@ burg before ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; George Mar@@ quet : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just not going to work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there is no need for a shopping centre that is empty .
in my view it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery .
but thanks to the ins@@ an@@ ely many - as I find - there is no place for sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the farmers market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a fitting simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing &apos;s DNA
in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from che@@ eks and hair@@ cuts sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year custo@@ dial sentence after revealing official diplomatic reports about Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( A matching simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg whose discipline combined her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and pioneering dissi@@ dent whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg originated from the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA extracted by Mann@@ ing and made out of the 30 portraits , as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data could look , a sharp , albeit a somewhat intellectual commentary not only about the formation of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convic@@ ted of 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the es@@ pi@@ onage law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison , her picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing obviously sits on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was just about the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette but@@ ts and chew@@ ing gum , extrac@@ ting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look .
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while they were in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed , so contact Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her imprisoned m@@ use became un@@ equal British eff@@ ec@@ aries who exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
they even created a comic &quot; supp@@ ressed images , &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o , who predicted a future where the President of Chelsea would translate judgment and it would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as would demand was a welcome kind of happy meeting .
there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender forces to find new twe@@ et@@ able ways to further infl@@ ame the rigid spl@@ its he should actually fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing demanded an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis is gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ fold of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was hoping to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , how amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological aspects , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully take with it is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care who we are and how open genetic data are for interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned comic @-@ novel .
it shows Mann@@ ing how she emerges with a hands @-@ free hands on the hands of the United States Dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ inary L@@ earn as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they make your speech cold , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it came straight from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the show personally , just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it , she will be greeted by the masks in the middle of the room , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ eres , which assemble like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , in which their genetic Hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with a pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea like the movement that was also behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University for murder
a country@@ wide ch@@ ase is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University who are looking for susp@@ ects after a man has been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .
on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the heads of the Cook County Court of Appe@@ al show .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches .
a public warning system published by the Chicago police authority indicates that the body was discovered on July 27th .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead in the scene , and det@@ ectives investigate the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively searching for the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
La@@ him has been a professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan C. Cub@@ bage , Vice President of University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ him was now in a state of absence and excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal investigation being investigated by the competent authorities , and the Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an email statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are willing to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in any way possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement said that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to be .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he was demanding the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them reinforce themselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities are helping to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip , saying that something happened in apartment 100@@ 8 .
the police described the scene very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred also on July 27th .
it was confirmed by security cameras that they were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said .
the management team of Grand Plaza has issued an explanation to the inhabitants : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko
the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM added the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the code , which describes the criteria for re@@ integration of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko he does not include anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list indicates that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the approved state funded dop@@ ing in Russian sports by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in reference to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programmes , and we will not give anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ ko &apos;s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission .
in conversation with the Russian outlet for r@@ sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ nov gave problems to the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nobody has to accept this report condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the WA@@ DA by the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia in November 2015 .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA Director General Olivier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moves &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .

the start @-@ ups that will help your business not become the next user
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure your luck with your e @-@ commerce startup , but the poll@@ s didn &apos;t work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - worse - dec@@ ei@@ ving .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; there was never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed .
she has called people from the outside for help .
a new Human Resources Start @-@ up race is growing in order to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it allows companies to conduct surveys , provide special groups and demographic groups , provide employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to b@@ ypass the C @-@ suite executives and to turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking their health , but where &apos;s the Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said they had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T .
in addition to snap surveys and surveys from certain teams , it provides a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low grant outcomes - so that you can drill down why .
companies are coming to see that they have to stay at the forefront of workplace culture so that you don &apos;t become the next user who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als , since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of nu@@ is@@ ance where those who have spoken were punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ LIN@@ T this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior , saw a growing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber case in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
u@@ ber has recently signed up as a client .
like G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ cent creates tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , gather confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , with which employees can report bad behavior .
and if the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the public opinion court has gr@@ asp@@ ed the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and CEO of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company finds its employees badly treated or beha@@ ved un@@ ethical , it may experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has appointed Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
in the past , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or e @-@ mail for the company headquarters , submit formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees .
now that the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that were previously concealed by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states have been identified and addressed faster , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair placement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the Risk Management Group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment li@@ tigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies started taking Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ es Com@@ mit@@ ment in 2002 more seriously after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
in February , Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million for financing in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising given the inter@@ connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees are more expecting from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only bets .
the employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that is worth their votes and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T .
investors reach retirement when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data about employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the data are useless if the administrators of a company do not take action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
indeed , when a company asks staff after your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change is not fast enough or not at all , it can grow dis@@ appointments and dem@@ oti@@ v@@ ise employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you &apos;ll have to be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies who have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow associates ask themselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about this ?
and if you don &apos;t care about why , why should I ? &quot;
Ma@@ dison Rep@@ ed , who is now carrying out monthly poll@@ s , was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ LIN@@ T , thus saving .
and after gaining feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems .
with Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always gets new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to better binding of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover .
&quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose the people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose your customers , then you will lose business .
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it starts at 23 : 00 , when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers are talking on one side of the new practice areas of the team on the campus .
some have pulled out their jer@@ sey top parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these idle minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three @-@ hour exercise before returning to the Water@@ man Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real pedal for the guys for the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer , Jim Mor@@ a , just before Monday was Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three courses of the U@@ C@@ LA should begin at 19 : 15 o &apos;clock in order to meet the already packed schedules of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day at which the Bru@@ ins postpon@@ ed the start of the camp almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six seasons in West@@ wood have carried out practical exercises .
in the course of August 18 , 18 exercises are to be held . 20 before the start of formal play preparations for their kick @-@ off against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supported the change of rules of the N@@ CA@@ A even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they plac@@ ate on , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which in view of the clean lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class , which has already been covered with foot@@ balls , which will be a safety net behind a door post , will not be an easy task .
brother players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem and it &apos;s not far fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then set out to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts review in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false noti@@ fications to third parties and display their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible false reports and send them to fact inspec@@ tors that may display results of the fact test from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential elections .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters being flooded with false stories in May , and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eradic@@ ate hat@@ eful post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook announced in a separate statement in German that in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts review will be launched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to finding out what stories are disputed by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they are reading and sharing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook continues to test his feature on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and working on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Hand@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expectedly emotional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only responded to a letter of thumb on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters smell like smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were also present .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome greeting , &quot; ) seems to be all too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hydro heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ch .
he walked through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape patches , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he drank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whis@@ key and started to write &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust received full access until 2006 when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des hit a decade later , the employees just started to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years ago when aristo@@ cr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; di@@ aries , letters from the period of English Empire , cards that represent what possessed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch fighting the two families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guys , let everything go his way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point for diving on a wider base in English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of an u@@ pro@@ ar that appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book titled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , Rho@@ des says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the uprising began in this area and I thought a revol@@ t was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; maybe the two are connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ter , which the family Dar@@ rel@@ l hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the smu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l from the 18th century is depicted , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery which was made years later when his coff@@ in was dug ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gentlemen seemed to be gay , always making debts and spending money on things that they could not afford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ men rede@@ emed their school crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good @-@ looking guys , with a talent to adverti@@ se Er@@ asmus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the end of his use in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique write experiences
he spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ mä@@ ki , the grounds of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with the dam@@ n life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf covered
with the v@@ eiling of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep Nelson Ar@@ tz the logo and the slogan .
at the end of August it is said to be the highlight of the campaign on Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th Island .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too nice for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ acher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they write on their website released yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that many things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in essence , we are firmly convinced that we as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f citizens are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , so it goes on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ in @-@ one promise , one that gives the city a unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , they stand in competition with other municipalities .
the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f is a central five @-@ figure sum that will cost you a new umbrella brand and campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises on pension schemes and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first glance , a normal operation .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the headquarters of the general staff , as in the past , but in the presi@@ dency of the Prime Minister .
the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the proceedings under the chair@@ manship of the He@@ ads of Government .
in this way , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the head@@ count .
the government dra@@ ins the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remained in office , but the commander of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were dismissed .
since the coup d &quot; é@@ tat , President Erdo@@ gan has fired 16@@ 9 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged ties to the movement of the Ex@@ iled Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who sees the Erdo@@ gan as the wi@@ re@@ pul@@ ler of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 persons who have been directly involved in the coup attempt , Ankara has been negotiating in Ankara for this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the coup attempt as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gift of God &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clean@@ se &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of February , the newspaper Hür@@ ri@@ yet published an article entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dis@@ comfort in the Military Head@@ quarters &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the General Staff , there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the ann@@ ul@@ ment of the ban for comb@@ ating soldiers , wrote the paper .
the great deal in the army and the security forces continues at any rate .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan made a decree by decree of further 73@@ 95 state servants , including 230@@ 3 police officers and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as though Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier than the actual lords of the country .
three times they put@@ ted on their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
following his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan th@@ ron@@ ged the military &apos;s power step by step , not least by calling on the reform requirements of the European Union .
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan is actively pushing forward an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a particularly un@@ named officer who sought asylum in foreign countries after the coup attempt , the Turkish army would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a few years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this happens , such a development could not let NATO get cold .
in any case , according to the pur@@ ges , there is no doubt about the readiness of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management structures and operational abilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media .
it envis@@ ages lowering the legal Immig@@ rants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules on obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions for families @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by changing the way US citizens from other countries will be spending Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate track for race car shuttle
over and over again over the past few months the future of the race track sh@@ utt@@ les has been cont@@ ested - now it should go quite fast .
even before the end of the year , on the di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated route , on which the tourist train runs , is to be built .
in order to secure the future of the race @-@ platform shuttle in the long term , construction work on the route will begin again this year according to the Ministry of Transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country ad@@ mits to this particularly important link for tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared State Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the repair of the route were estimated at around 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country takes 75 percent .
the Treaty , on which the shuttle shall also be appointed by the country in the future , is currently in agreement , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the Southern Thurin@@ gia train as operators are already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are tra@@ ded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this means that the race @-@ share Shuttle should be ordered regularly in December 2017 .
the race @-@ track shuttle is a popular rail link between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g especially for tourists .
over the past few months , a pilot plant has been testing whether the route should be used by a sufficient number of people to re@@ order them in the future .
in addition , the track is extremely b@@ ump@@ y in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
just as you thought it won &apos;t be even crazy in 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots will come .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( Foundation for responsible robot@@ ics ) has published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start taking her ascen@@ sion seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of finger@@ nails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people are making fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey at the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex d@@ olls have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adapt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or the color of his finger@@ nails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is even more disturbing since many robots have the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would make a step@@ per woman look progres@@ sively . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex d@@ olls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin .
for example , the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot enables its users to adapt their robot to the properties that they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex @-@ Ro@@ bot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , who con@@ veys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as much as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enth@@ uses the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she likes what you like and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , be fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent female characteristics , the all@@ u@@ sions to rape , when one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( called here : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah , trouble one the most .
on his site , True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy is compared with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it says on the website .
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy .
their origin and increasing refin@@ ement point to something darker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional en@@ core .
most men will certainly not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R noted their increasing popularity , they nevertheless remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture .
but what sick@@ ens out of the marginal zones can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not odd or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission to do so .
there is however a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time where women &apos;s rights are threatened by the world in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have women sexually attacked .
the most deter@@ rent aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the ent@@ win@@ ed body and the sophisticated eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as realistic as possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human , im@@ itating the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no intermedi@@ ation or background story , nothing that hin@@ ders independence or anything that could distur@@ b the fantasy of total submission .
in other words , they are fake slaves .
or to put it in the nar@@ ration of 2017 : ma@@ ids
do umps affect great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney an ep@@ it@@ ome of the healthy sense of man
it has become a tr@@ ump @-@ wisdom of the Tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized the US elec@@ torate have split families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers in the USA with advice about how to deal with the horror of the confused relatives .
we all re@@ port@@ edly ex@@ ert ourselves to burst our filter bubbles .
less noted is the power of dump@@ s to bring families together .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lef@@ tist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
it reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House everyone whom she knows , including Republi@@ can kin@@ ship , with whom she fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite peculi@@ arly on the same side .
around the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it is in a further context that this also involves considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the dis@@ figur@@ ing effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and &quot; tr@@ ump , &quot; we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that his bi@@ bs no longer have to be rep@@ elled .
however , there is an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump re@@ public@@ ans &quot; norm@@ alize &quot; the right wing , suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison with its standards .
today I find myself surrounded by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of crazy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked like ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact occur as very mild criminal off@@ ences .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must only be mentally healthy to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the biggest of the car@@ ou@@ sels in New York &apos;s Park department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city when you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are kn@@ ur@@ led and the animals twist to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ per@@ ishing music con@@ veys this in a strange way .
as many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city doesn &apos;t do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite across the day when I found that Swiss Cot@@ tage is not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the Them@@ e Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage does not count - but a big round@@ about in the north of London .
but Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magic experience , because here two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ year @-@ old can go to it and all have a great time .
if I could have assessed the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked afterwards .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass my credit card .
in the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what a neutral exchange should be , but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is needed .
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ tically gr@@ in while I tired the experience of submitting my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pains transferred from prison to hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us , for the second time , left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year , he was hospit@@ alized due to the treatment of cuts to his w@@ ri@@ sts , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence due to murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp during the early morning of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by sho@@ ving her through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed he had his girlfriend for a ni@@ ghtly intru@@ der hiding in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal this time to the six @-@ year custo@@ dial sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they said they were too indul@@ gent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Prosec@@ ution Authority said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is at risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ grade pupils from F@@ utzen and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were fired into the vac@@ ations and the secondary schools .
three of the relief students will go to the secondary school , four at the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening school director An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
the 29 students of the four classes , led by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , elected a young eagle rising up in the chickens , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the lower band brought a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the chickens &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and caused it to hat@@ ch from his chickens .
instead of a chicken ü@@ k@@ ens a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of him sm@@ ashed , the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain and escaped .
after that , three and four classes showed a chicken dance in Y@@ von@@ ne Frank &apos;s studio .
the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln , the cylinders carried to the bet .
the Eagle stands for integration , said school manager An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te .
the young@@ ster is indeed different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
she wanted every four @-@ year @-@ boy to feel accepted in his new school .
thanks to the colleagues , Michael Müller , former head of school , who always jumps in with teaching bott@@ len@@ ecks , and the parents &quot; representatives followed .
the cu@@ cum@@ ber period is now over , class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher declared .
after two years of teaching , she only reli@@ ed her students very reluct@@ antly because it was a really great time .
finally , she was able to rely on the four @-@ gra@@ ders .
finally , all students left a song of summer time and holiday time .
in doing so , great joy broke with the children .
eight first @-@ grade pupils have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were det@@ ained in Greece because of illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted on television .
on the morning of August 1 , a group of illegal tents were arrested by the police in Si@@ th@@ onia , among them the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released , while an investigation is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported on B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control over the free camping and place serious fin@@ es to anyone found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls will continue throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court could impose a fine of money .
software update for diesel vehicles : what suffer@@ ers need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group offered software updates for a total of about 5.3 million cars .
they are supposed to improve exhaust emissions from emissions categories euros 5 and Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from this .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new promotion mandatory ?
no , the software updates negotiated are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have che@@ ating software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Aviation Office ( KBA ) has arranged their retro@@ fitting .
how and when are customers informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the coming months , but not yet called an exact date .
Daimler advised to write to each person affected .
if an inspection is due anyway , this will be done within the scope of the inspection .
how long will the retro@@ fit take place ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from the political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , the autom@@ akers do not act voluntarily on the subject of the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming could be to get an appointment .
what are drivers driving cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ?
the ACE recommends waiting .
foreign manufacturers would probably re@@ tract , such as S@@ met@@ anin .
is there now a massive drop in the price of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE feared that .
but in the regions where driving b@@ ans threaten .
up to now , there has been no loss of value for older diesel in the rural area .

Kennedy &apos;s Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to be political .
one of the winners does not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to get one of the cov@@ eted awards from the prestigious Kennedy Center .
as announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) also belong to the scholars .
prizes will be presented at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will host a reception and together with his wife Mel@@ ania will take part in the award ceremony .
the Le@@ ar pri@@ z@@ ew@@ inner announced with progressive TV series already announced that it would not be possible to participate in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presi@@ dency has decided to neg@@ lect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ve them of the means - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed that she will use the talk with Tr@@ ump to make clear their point of view .
the Kennedy Center , named after the former president John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
former winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city liv@@ able
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ lach City Buil@@ der , will reti@@ re next year .
the job is already written out - but suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been a city builder for the past 31 years .
and the work is still great fun for him , as he con@@ veys in the press conference .
he reports on varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his followers .
at the same time it is surprising that no application has yet to fulfil the requirements profile .
the city is looking for an architect or a civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
in keeping with the regular periods of dis@@ miss@@ al , there should still be enough time for a revision .
since Has@@ lach works for the administrative community as the Lower Building Law Body , the applicant has to present relevant conclusions .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if they can no longer fill them , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice .
but city clos@@ eness is important to the city and itself , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate as well as a good mood between authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years in ministry , some significant projects have accumulated , looking back at the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the Bau@@ amt and his staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen parking place , for example , have been initiated .
the bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium renovation is still a topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter alone will be@@ ak around € 1.5 million , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker appreci@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
in terms of design , there is a lot of scope for a city building master .
with Has@@ lach &apos;s own building yard and gardening a lot can be re@@ acted flexibly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the ol@@ d@@ town is listed as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye on what suits it &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going city builder states .
anyway , the city main@@ tain@@ er bears great responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything runs over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in support and coordination , he can count on many years of experience : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been doing this for ten years now , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker wants his successor too long , W@@ acker wants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further shaping of the city .
according to the town of Has@@ lach , anyone who wants to be heir to Roland W@@ acker should be able to present a completed study as a diploma engineer or b@@ achel@@ or with the subject of architecture and have good knowledge in the fields of construction planning and construction planning law .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt ( Stadt@@ bau@@ amt ) supports civil and civil engineering , construction management , excav@@ ation facilities , administration of municipal property , Municipal depot with building yard and city landsc@@ aping , as well as the Lower House of Building Law , including the preservation of monuments .
bike on lines thrown : South railway line closed
according to the police , the previously unknown cul@@ pr@@ its had thrown the blue bicycle off the railway track in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ene Stra@@ it ( B@@ 116 ) onto the lines .
these were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and have been searching for them for the night .
a red sco@@ oter and a bicycle driver were observed near the crime scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond the borders of Lausanne , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch at the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ators would have put themselves in great danger and also je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the delay of delay and the cost of rail transport , even the pat@@ rons of the railway customers could come to the perpetr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speaker said overall , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a significant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum is to be dealt with . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the South rail line could be guided without obstruc@@ tions .
just under ten passenger trains were dropped Friday morning , two of which entered the long distance traffic .
freight trains did not fall , but they had delay .
according to the Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
however , a new study claims the exact opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the inc@@ urable condition affecting approximately 1.3 million in the United States and 300@@ ,000 in the United States causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rhea , weight loss and extreme ti@@ redness .
while the affected person is usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products in order to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestinal system .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells in the gut are pat@@ rolling to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in food do not penetrate the body .
cells that are able to trigger inflammation are ev@@ ened by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
if the equilibrium leads too far in the direction of inflammation , an inflammatory bow@@ el disease can result .
in experiments , it was found that a kind of tolerance stimulating immune cell is found in mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a food intoler@@ ant to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han encourages more tolerant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ li@@ eus , if the same system also works in people .
the post @-@ doctoral researcher Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan was examining a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe that was separated , but had not had this .
she suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bial mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species were found that were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in mice .
mice were taken up in a sterile environment so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. Mat@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria impact the immune system , the researchers incorporated L. Mat@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to im@@ mature immune cells isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ able cells .
when the active component was cleaned out of the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in mice &apos;s food , the number of cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han levels were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan states that people have the same toler@@ able cells as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflamm@@ ations on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values can lead to an extension of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic &quot; &quot; &quot;
at Manchester United signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der played his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday began and impressed the keeper &apos;s role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will .
but matic was excluded from the pre @-@ preparation of the blues @-@ tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho added that he had to improve before the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ e@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u joined Avi@@ va Stadium as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho made his start @-@ up for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed in this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still wanted three more new commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of his four priority obligations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get three out of four , I would like to thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have taken great trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner into the sky .
the pilots flew off Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Mich@@ ig@@ an and moved into the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action took 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the shape of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new grav@@ ure for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turns out : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD leader , S &amp; D Prime Ministers still looked for Berlin with a certain concern before elections .
but there was no disrup@@ tive fire from the party headquarters , but no counter@@ wind coming from the League - so the most important wish of the election champi@@ ons was .
since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally .
since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus are observing the events in the provincial capitals of the state with growing horror .
what Mr Schulz has been from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with head@@ winds .
there were grav@@ ings .
and one by one .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against the coalition of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not go@@ vern more reliably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising Group exit of a Green Party member has pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the parliamentary elections , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green Federal Bureau Chief Michael Kell@@ ner urged the dissi@@ dent Lower Saxony @-@ Green MEP El@@ ke T@@ westen to return her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear for@@ gery of the elec@@ torate &apos;s will . &quot; &quot; &quot;
El@@ ke T@@ westen immediately has to give back their mandate , &quot; said the Federal Executive and election leader of the Green Party of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must not be true at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD election campaig@@ ner si@@ ghs when on Friday morning the new message of hi reached the party headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is standing on the CD@@ U without his own government majority after the transition of the green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ westen there .
it is the preliminary climax of a whole series of big and small crises in the SPD state associations .
and no one knows what &apos;s next .
the Mis@@ ers began with the un@@ expectedly strong defeat in the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , no more , the comrades were re@@ ass@@ uring at that time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
this became even worse - and everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel generated the SPD in exchange , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te sli@@ pped the party smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the weeks after , the comrades have lab@@ ori@@ ously ra@@ ged themselves again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then , when they had just exhausted new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him came the next grav@@ ure .
mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD governor , lost his Nim@@ bus that weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned .
and because in crisis communications he got pretty much wrong as to what to do wrong .
since then , Schol@@ z has fought for his political survival .
so now Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW exhaust atmosphere and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony prime minister had already been critic@@ ised for a long time .
mi@@ ese demand values were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of this , Wei@@ l has been trying to set accents more and more in the federal government over the past few weeks .
the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin , too , did not remain hidden in Martin Schulz &apos;s environment .
they let him be given , as they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party from Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could occur .
in doing so , Wei@@ l is not guilty of the parti@@ ality of the Dutch Gre@@ ens in Lower Saxony .
and Schulz is not at all .
for the time being , comrades endeav@@ our to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here especially on the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ arians T@@ westen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ westen combined her own career star@@ ters on the interests of all the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ westen was not elected as a direct candidate , but was elected to parliament on the national list of the Dutch Gre@@ ens , including the Lower Saxony Member .
the logical consequence would be that they give back their mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compla@@ ins of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters &quot; vote four years ago was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people have made Stephan Wei@@ l a prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann , who is leading the Lower Saxony as a candidate in the parliamentary elections , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U member fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked to clarify the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments of the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
funding for town core III
those who want to renov@@ ate his house in the years can soon get support from the country .
the mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of St@@ eg city development informed on this Wednesday in sens@@ ations .
at the beginning of the information session , Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a review of what happened to date .
since 1991 , I have been giving in sentim@@ ents san@@ itation areas .
at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding .
in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous san@@ itations are a &quot; successful project &quot; - it is important to promote inner development and not only to open up new areas of construction .
on April 4 , the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Karlsruhe has received the information that there will be a re@@ development zone III .
the funding amount was 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which 500@@ ,000 euros would come from the country , the rest of the community sensi@@ tivities .
how is a re@@ development area now ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; one will , as Sch@@ ind@@ ler continue , investigate where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role as to whether there is interest in the planned area at all .
if necessary , the regional boundaries could then also be postpon@@ ed .
the bridge was on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal government programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding infrastructure .
the measures would be carried out objective , that is , per plot .
the rehabilitation area would then finally be defined as a stat@@ ute .
the grant period for funding has been running since January 1 , 2017 until April 30 , 20@@ 26 .
however , until September this year , however , the survey will take place only once , within the framework of which the participants in the rehabilitation area will receive a questionnaire for filling out .
in November or December , the rules of the association shall be carried out as soon as possible , so that the restructuring will begin next year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently declared that every commun@@ e had to perform the fores@@ een preliminary investigations .
the aim is to evaluate the urban development of the situation and to decide when it will be rehabil@@ itated and to what extent .
there will also be a re@@ development note in the plot register for the respective plot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again after sens@@ ations and get a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants .
that is why there will be questionna@@ ires which will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Building and Property Bo@@ w &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; with which it is concerned with the structural condition and the remedi@@ ation views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and housing sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; information about size , division and residents of a residential area can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; business bow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to be filled if business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , should be noted , Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionnaire was not at the same time an application for funding .
moreover , new construction measures are not eligible for funding .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler emphasized that the distribution of subsidies according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; - who comes first , warns first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could not reserve funds for later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conclusion , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Location II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to those present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or sets himself a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in house and car
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology by its company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory An@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and a dog im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am would also like to change the locks at houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now installed both at home and in his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the expenses of the White House cost thousands of tax@@ pa@@ yers
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a Marine helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American production last month , costs tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the data of the military entrusted to the TI@@ ME magazine up to $ 24@@ ,000 .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programmes .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the helicopter , which was manufactured in Connec@@ tic@@ ut , was issued next to a yacht of Ma@@ ine , a fire engine from Wis@@ con@@ sin and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the military bure@@ au of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or cargo , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superi@@ ors , the Deputy naval commander for aviation .
the message indicated that the helicopter arrived on the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long , until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if the flight departure from the White House should be delayed due to the restriction of service hours a second crew would be needed for the return flight .
the original flight crew was during the event at the helicopter while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane .
from the records provided by the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was required .
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
data sets indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could viol@@ ate the destination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the command@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds like you are locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated as an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the President gave an impetus to reform of the health reform that was in progress in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but to request their use only for a photo surgery is unusual .
in February , Tr@@ ump conducted an investigation as the president plane in front of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of reports that compla@@ ined about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently lead training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area to set up the US president in the White House with precise centimet@@ res .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 performed 58 exercise land@@ ings in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was the training requirement of the flight crew for the month , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours on that day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said the tax@@ pa@@ yers assumed the burden of not one of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said the company had not been involved in spreading the helicopter to the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budget@@ ing records for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , however , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour .
records of the unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers to be set based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs contained in the annual funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a 2015 RA@@ ND study , reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but also take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract completion .
at that time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things that are produced in America this week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not even thousands of people depend on it .
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , it is appropriate to highlight this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine car .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and jo@@ king with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss before tri@@ cky job
runner @-@ up of the second tennis Bundes@@ liga matches at the Tab@@ ular third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
the TC blue @-@ white ne@@ uss will kick off tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the third stop in Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
despite the fact that five games still have a flaw@@ less balance , the leader of the second tennis Bundes@@ liga has gained the sense of reality .
team principal Mari@@ us Z@@ ay , in any case , has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team which always plays a very similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially in the back positions I find the team very good . &quot;
especially imports from the high North provide for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to stak@@ es in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ rei@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult for us as always . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you need a good deal of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser squ@@ ad for the trip to the high North is practically .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
if the Fren@@ ch@@ man , currently active at the Chall@@ enger Tournam@@ ent in the Italian Bi@@ ella , won &apos;t join the Bundes@@ liga game , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) playing at the Czech Liber@@ ec tournament will be the first time in this season .
the hitherto un@@ sealed Chil@@ ene Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Cas@@ tillo , yesterday with the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ sky , was still at the ball at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el .
he should be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and Belgian Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories against the Club on the Al@@ ster last Sunday , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could once again move into the team .
if it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was the number one of the junior world rank@@ ings in January 2016 , someone from the trainer then fills up the cad@@ res .
how America can harm the O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump did not really feel happy when he signed his signature on Wednesday evening under the law to tigh@@ ten the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress approved a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming against the U.S. coup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the draft intends to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors of the local O@@ MV , which co @-@ funded the construction of the Russian east sou@@ ll@@ ation Nord Stream 2 together with other European firms , have been al@@ armed .
the dr@@ one is enormous .
nevertheless , it is too early for an assessment of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to raise the sanctions by Executive Order to life .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has seen which the Group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Staff@@ el 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is put in the center of the hit series by Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars killer reveals , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x has not been over yet .
the seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest villa@@ ins of the show .
with the third season , the DE@@ A has focused its attention on the world &apos;s most successful drug traffi@@ cking : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; led by four powerful sponsors , they &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 Company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only operate with more government bri@@ ber@@ y and violent actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ az@@ ar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .
in the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal returns to Ja@@ vier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian prosecution authorities to support the war on drugs .
other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .
the third season of Nar@@ cos will start on September 1st .
roll back : the city has 46 kitchen aids
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the municipal kinder@@ gar@@ tens the clock is turned back .
on September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld will take over food supply in the municipal children &apos;s day@@ care facilities ( kit@@ as ) again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cook will continue to be cooked except for the house : a cat@@ erer takes care of this task and provides fresh air co@@ ols .
the town runs 46 day care centers in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunch@@ time .
in the past Kit@@ a@@ year , 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are cared for 45 hours of the week eat in the K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour care when children stay until 2 pm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time personnel from 1 September kitchen service : they warm up the supplied food , supplement them with salad , raw food and fruit , divide the meal individually , leave aside , clean away , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; employees are assigned to a ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as seven gru@@ es@@ ome units - decides on the range of hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen assistants are now part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about : healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; children should help prepare food . &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen staff to the team is sensible .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
cleaning of the K@@ ita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning personnel in future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has , in addition to improving the quality of the kitchen , also has the charm that it has turned out to be the most economical solution for the city as the most economical way out of the press office .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re @-@ hired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so heavy at about 750 people in the education sector , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of the Society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ on , am@@ using head of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women are candidates in the coun@@ ties in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; women &apos;s role cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement .
elections can only be genu@@ inely representative and credi@@ ble if women participate fully and be involved in all parts of the election process .
the Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5 .
the Taliban issued threats against a choice process that coinci@@ des with the transition of international combat actions to an advisory role .
this year , the elections for the first time will be handed over to the next government peac@@ efully by a democr@@ atically elected government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ley said a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of 3.6 million voters .

men try to wipe 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried to ro@@ b a 13 year old girl on Thursday .
according to the police , the men said the 13 @-@ year @-@ old , who stopped working with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße , against 14.@@ 55 , because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s cell phone .
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old rejected the request but continued with her friends .
as a result , one of the perpetr@@ ators tried to attack the cell phone and the girl &apos;s necklace , which however failed .
the duo escaped without prey .
the two young men could later be arrested by the police .
the investigations are running .
G@@ MB concerns about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie Factory in Glasgow
a trade union wants to make a long @-@ term commitment to production at its Glasgow plant in the management of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company had silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the factory producing other products like Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea bis@@ cuits .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the company &apos;s branch manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s call for concerns to express concerns that financing for modernization of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot obtain clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross does not concern our members deeply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generations of families have worked here and the workforce is strongly focused on the local community and the Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow is urgently looking for a flour@@ ishing presence in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ woman from Pla@@ dis : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the T@@ oll@@ cross has received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to it as we value the ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed openly .
we discussed with the employees that we , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , constantly review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we realise the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site full and complete . should our operations change at the site , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona in front of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
La Liga page likes to regret her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
in their pursuit of N@@ ey@@ mar , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not abandon after they have given an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to release its release clause , but have they warned Barcelona three years before the world record attack ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , as the Lig@@ ue 1 Club is ready to break the world record by more than twice the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returning to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds .
after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional athlete in the world . PS@@ G offers sal@@ aries of over 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a source near the Catal@@ ans mind insi@@ sted that the club always did its best to take care of him since his arrival in San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G president before this prospect ?
when Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a severe warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish association expressing interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International of Italy to leave in any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .

on the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown perpetr@@ ator has intentionally turned off a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ feld Street front of the property number 30 and thus caused a damage of over 200 Euro on the fair@@ ing of the vehicle .

in the area of the town centre of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car arrived in his lane so that he had to turn right .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; report on the abuse of abuse reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is what author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann says .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement , &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared after publication of the German press agency , he expected the former Regen@@ s@@ burger bishop and today &apos;s Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , and of the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology .
it would be very useful to the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret over their own la@@ yo@@ ffs or their false appreciation of the processes at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican paper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised the fact that there are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; double standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when reporting on violence in the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in regard to the gri@@ ps in Regensburg , no one doubt that it is &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; said the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday life and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Thur@@ n und Ta@@ xis also said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we like to go to the church and it &apos;s a dev@@ oti@@ onal feeding point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pun@@ ches were a very normal pedago@@ gical means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be finished with che@@ ek@@ y children as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they find it unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for the past decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports of abuse incidents , Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; completely wrong@@ ly , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who auth@@ ored the mem@@ or@@ and@@ um &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I have to protect Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report .
what exactly is there in the 440 @-@ page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber who was instructed by the Bishop of Regensburg ?
between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , a total of 5@@ 47 &quot; Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; became victims of over @-@ attacked , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report , it is said about Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; in summary , it can be said that , in many cases , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister was employed in many cases of physical and psychological violence .
especially in the case of high emotional appeal the punishment for the students could be more intense .
in contrast to many other defend@@ ants , however , many victims claim that many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even share positive memories with him despite violence . &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen St R@@ atz@@ inger has reli@@ eved his mind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incidents of violent exercise on protective fish in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gives a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one , many students highlight his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , it also appears to be a ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ cian and perfec@@ tion@@ ist who became more tangible in the gre@@ ener when a domain record didn &apos;t produce top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as a bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the rear , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is found in it at all .
he is just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or co @-@ operation in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school were also ex@@ propri@@ ated outside his sphere of influence .
at best it is possible to repro@@ ach him , to experience it too late or to have taken first hints seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ litter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; school , on which he worked , was felt by virtually all respon@@ dents as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the vast majority of his pupils , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , also give a very excellent testimony , describes him as &quot; warm hearted , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understandable , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher , who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and sweets and &quot; always surrounded by the grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority complain about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotional appeal , which also sometimes led to break@@ downs .
the fact that he did not only kne@@ ad with chairs and cast the keys on the floor , but also put ear @-@ fi@@ gs on the hair or ears , he had already admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , in both parents and teachers .
do you know such ch@@ ast@@ ening methods as well ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced that in a secular school , a state high school .
compared to what it is about in this report , namely , the app@@ alling sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school , this is ad@@ mitt@@ edly bag@@ at@@ elles .
one wonders whether his fame and role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI has to do with the fact that many media have just r@@ ushed to him .
in the Bavarian pop@@ e many who have never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , in connection with the report , a great deal was reported on the subject of abuse in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger find any involvement or co @-@ operation with regard to sexual abuse in the final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claim to have entrusted themselves to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were initiated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said an officer on behalf of the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in educ@@ ating sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims are silent .
if they were not even familiar with parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a conductor , who , professionally , would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Schüler R@@ atz@@ inger assume role with regard to mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student said so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I don &apos;t see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetr@@ ator .
I think it ... also for really absurd , to assume that it seems to him ... Bu@@ sters have opened more ha@@ un@@ ting or even more clearly or even more than their parents , dormit@@ ory managers , trusted teachers , etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report comes to the very clear conclusion : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the students and / or their surroundings were entrusted to him in the run @-@ up could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus acqu@@ itted of any co @-@ knowledge .
he cannot be accused of not preventing him or having brought him to the ad .
therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these disgu@@ sting crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media , much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violent exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was to be read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look away &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem in reporting everything and bl@@ ended into a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , right in the middle , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that is exactly the mis@@ use of the report .
there is a clean separation : between the pre @-@ school and the high school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and excessive violence as well as , we say , other alle@@ gations .
in addition , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , i.e. also for four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the choir director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the whole terrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were ma@@ imed and mal@@ formed , and suffered horri@@ bly , were all taken on the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where there must be really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions .
but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , had nothing to do , because he didn &apos;t get the boy until they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on this , as most witnesses stress , the theme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre @-@ school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is t@@ abo@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac &quot; conditions .
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this is also true for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims appreciated the common humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at most , the blame still remains to have looked away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he was reported from the states at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he had just started to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not working and was responsible ( as the witness ) did not want to hear , and then again around 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger rigor@@ ously shut the ears in front of the states ?
Michael hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um , which even reproduced the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out that the punishment practice continues to be practi@@ sed in the pre @-@ school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .
that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was , as test pun@@ ishments were long ago forbidden in Bavaria .
before that they occurred in a legal grey area , as each of us probably knows .
it was difficult for him to estimate where those affected might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he has always looked away .
that is just not true .
only in 1980 the penalty for schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Thur@@ n und Ta@@ xis stated that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards to that time .
how do you see it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians talk about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pit@@ falls of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. the danger of judging the past according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess is right .
but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse that was in@@ timi@@ dating at all times , and not for what has been burned in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , which goes far beyond what is usual at that time .
this is all aw@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it will finally work up .
but at the same time , I have to protect Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him .
its means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , i.e. , to pull the ear and to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when corpor@@ al punishment was then forbidden , he was strictly adher@@ ed to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what picture of his Regen@@ s@@ burger time did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger play in conversations with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the subject matter of testing also go to language ?
Michael hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI says from his perspective , the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen just played a minor role .
nevertheless , I did not at all hide the fact that he conducted a strict regi@@ ment there .
but even this must be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demand of un@@ conditioned discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world drink from the hitherto rather nation@@ ally known Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and sweets alone , one does not even make a big singer from un@@ ru@@ ly boys and above all success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of people did you experience for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks with her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through work on the book and beyond that , I have met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful , humor@@ ous , basic , deeply believing and heart @-@ loving people , from whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could do just a fly a little .
I regularly get in contact with , like many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen today , 23 years after his em@@ ulation , regularly contact him , visit him , read it - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family .
those who did not forgive him until now , that he once was stern to them , are therefore clearly in the minority .
today most of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are thank@@ ful to him for having enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , sure , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect@@ ability , to which they still look up and worship them .
and please , once again very clearly : all that you submit to him are educational methods which were then the order of the day .
we can be glad that we have long overcome this time .
but it is most un@@ just , a man just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent that is behind it , all too obvious .
for the report , which has just been published , weighs on him .
now the starting point would be a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps no one else in Germany would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally to leave in peace .
