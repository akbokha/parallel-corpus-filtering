<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren institution, where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A crypt chapel, where now it is dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Farmers are cultivating the former bottom of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich supports exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's annoying if maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this, who had to get upset because the car nav showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals Bavaria of the State Government, are anything but up-to-date - but especially so very insightful.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread-area of Munich's Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria atlas is a patchwork that one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "in the large overview map, more detailed maps, so-called" "" "original sheets" "", "were incorporated for cities and municipalities." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bayerische Vermessungsverwaltung between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the spring of 1800, the French military leader occupied Bavaria during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographical survey of Bavaria on behalf - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops marched with the peace of Lunéville of February 9, 1801, it was today's neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria card.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Elector Max IV. Joseph drove the project forward, founded the" "" "Topographic Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bavarian surveying management." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The composition sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found on the Bayerische Landesbibliothek (Bayerische Landesbibliothek).</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / present is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is subsendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded 21 years after the map was created, in 1877, as the Munich suburb.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Lower Saxony is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the present Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: at the zooming, a smaller-scale map appears with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbered plots of the so-called "judgment," from which the land tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small parcels are no more farmers there today - but farmers in the plant" "" "Land in sun" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, the scene of the October festival in 1810, was actually still a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the reference sheet, in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name "on the Gasteig" or the "Auf der Lüften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one once locked people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich circle Irrenberg was created" "" "Auf der Auer Lüften" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden managed the establishment - that psychiatrist, who is brought to death by King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and, for example, finished the so-called" "" "Irren." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "he also prohibited the personnel to use violence against the occupants," "" "said Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked for an exhibition with the institution." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients there was first place, later it was extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar [1905].</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, has been there since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people in the Munich Salesianum will meet at the site of the former Auer Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth hostel with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the children's house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was built in an architectural allusion to the original construction of the Irrenberg, which had been destroyed during World War II by bombing raids." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was marked as" "" "main square" "" "around 1856. the Kaufingerstraße" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "" "was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also made a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allies bombed many holes in the inner city in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A large one remained until today - at Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business buildings and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn track.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for Colors has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which will enter into force by August 28, 2017, demands special attention to afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians, as a series of questionable, race-based incidents occur throughout the country and can be noted here," says the Group's opinion.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recent law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to win discrimination, as well as the state's prosecution authorities that are disproportionately aimed at minorities, led the group to publish the travel warning, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "they are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed," "" "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the US.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents such as racist events against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the trip through the state and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Missouri Attorney General in which it is shown that black drivers in the state will stop 75 percent more often than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people need to be ready to bring a deposit or let the relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report that classifies the state with regard to the number of injuries on the 16th place of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the states had adopted immigration laws that oblige local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for violations of immigration, which in the view of the ACLU will contribute to further racial profiling.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">The electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischbacher Weidefence-Project is a project of success and will continue next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have obtained a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fischbacher CDU local association together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies met at the court of the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann initially gave insights into his farm, in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and just as many kittens and houses in five apartments holiday palaces.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Schwarzwaldmilch" "" "is the alternative-less marketing path for the milk of its cows, so Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">Only regionales come to the table of the Feriengäste.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "as he is also BLHV-Chairman of Fisherman's bach he described the electric fence project as" "" "elementary important." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "I cannot profitably manage such steep surfaces." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">The grassland area provides a lot of work, a lot must be handled with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," "" "stressed Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the parental farm and engaged it without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he does not lead a bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader's support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the afforestation of the surfaces could be dragged out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and making thoughts about how they carry on their operation," "" "stressed the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often criticised for funding</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced about the electric fence in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The preservation area is thus 40 hectares, which must not be affixed to at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of €71 500, half was promoted by leader, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you do a really good job, without farmers and rural women it's not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">Peter Weiss also stood firm: "best food is produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The landscape conservation directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state promotion of pasture fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The precondition is the presence of a conveying system designated by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">Moreover, the area to be fenced should not be tuppery (slope above 35 per cent) and must be threatened by afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">The proposal for eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence, is currently running for the Fisherman's electric fence project 2018.</seg>
<seg id="96">The accounting area is equivalent to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are worth more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN about the President's suggestions for drastic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty Imitators would have liked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he grabbed the meaning, and in particular the meaning it was attributed to, as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to his base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller complained, "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem you refer to is later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is properly correct, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's stirring words, the only ones in which a state does not only invite old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, your oppressed masses, who yearn to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of your rich shores."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "eleventh garbage" "" "was better to be seen on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not involved in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people were not welcome in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is in fact a conflict of the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who chose to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they performed a highly political act.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was to show the connections between French and American republicanism by representing the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical depiction.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the Exilantes.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone but rather an early neo-conservative, who brings the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty moves forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not light the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh stumbled upon something quite unusual.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">Lazarus's great imaginative act was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is all about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not light the way, but ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butflip - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team as a team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "Eilidh is rather modest." ""</seg>

<seg id="144">The Commonwealth Silver medal winner, who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m barrier, says that it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The mid-distance runner Muir leads on this road and last year brought five British and two European records.</seg>

<seg id="150">The team captain says that they are "enormously proud" of the fact that many of their compatriots do not only belong to the team, but in some cases also be accompanied by medals and finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being a team captain is that it was voted by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honor anyway, but to know that my teammate voted for me and chose me, it makes it something very special for me," she added.</seg>

<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of a bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers hit him for anything, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He blamed in the criticism, sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in the year 1783, Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute, we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union was therefore suing him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"" "the Governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with" "" "Na, and?" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's only Facebook," many people said.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state, which is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">"" "" "" "he has the second highest consent of the nation's 50 governors." ""</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary hot head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in guiding his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very clever to use Facebook as primary means to connect with his voters and play his hair-less head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of persons coming to the Governor's side is a public forum that is officially called and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, the spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the Governor's actions and argued that the blocking of comments is nothing more than moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who vibrate online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who speak to their elected leaders: a teacher, a businessman and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profound.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan Catholic faith.</seg>

<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times when you have done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest demonstrators and to silence them.</seg>
<seg id="191">But this is exactly what is happening digitally.</seg>

<seg id="350">In response to this, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily taken into custody under the pretext of "safeguarding national sovereignty."</seg>

<seg id="370">In March, six Pacific countries - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua including the Paniai shootings.</seg>

<seg id="409">The survey of more than 1,000 people, which was conducted by a jet charter service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also stated that younger travellers were more likely to disregard the rules.</seg>
<seg id="410">Of the respondents admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent of millennials were, compared with less than 15 percent, members of the Generation X.</seg>
<seg id="411">The most common items that were deliberately passed on to TSA agents were food and liquids.</seg>
<seg id="412">More than 3 percent said, knowingly carrying items with blades through security control, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs into the aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="413">The company said it asked travelers across the country to find out how many inadvertently smuggled goods to airport security and how many would have done it intentionally.</seg>
<seg id="414">It is no surprise that the people who are most often smuggled - knowingly or unknowingly - carry through security, those who were most often flying.</seg>

<seg id="423">In addition to the ever triumptuous figures for sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced another, less glamorous figure at the announcement of the recent quarterly balance sheet: the recent changes in the new mass market model 3.</seg>
<seg id="424">In recent months, Musk often had more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery just starts.</seg>
<seg id="425">Now Musk admits: 63.000 pre-orders have already been withdrawn from the total of 518,000 pre-orders.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is merely non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">In case of cancellation, Tesla will pay the 1000 Euro (in the United States 1000 US dollars and in Great Britain 1000 pounds) "Reservation balance."</seg>
<seg id="428">At present 45,000 of such non-binding reservations envisage, Musk admitted in a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">Tesla CEO, however, does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders would be a problem.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge for the ambitious growth targets is not in demand, but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">In 2018, all models will be taken together - 500,000 by 2020, a million by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk there are 1800 reservations per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">Anyone who orders a "Model 3" today may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive his brand-new production lines that have never been tested in practice without any major interruptions with maximum capacity utilization.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>

<seg id="440">One day after he was sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, Chief of the Environmental Protection Agency, took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce the emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the lawsuit which had been raised against his previous site in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">The deadline is 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for ozone.</seg>

<seg id="445">Pruitt, who was before his appointment by President Donald Trump State Attorney of Oklahoma, was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations for a long time.</seg>

<seg id="450">"" "" "" "under earlier administrations, the EPA has often failed to comply with the deadlines for execution and then to be tried by activists and others in an agreement," "" "said Pruitt, who accused the EPA for more than a dozen times in his previous job." ""</seg>

<seg id="466">750 years St. Hilarius church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumour will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, 16th July, at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and supporters of Tumarc a concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">"" "Walter Martini stresses:" "" "it is a unique village gem." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergischer Urtonbuch: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church on it to Tumbling along with the Abbey of Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the deed, in addition to the former parish church, in addition to the former parish church, there was also a beautiful courtyard, to which the church or the patron was right and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">There were also people living there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt from 1858, it was next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the village image of Tumbling, the "mountain" of the third, the noble settler nucleus of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the period around the year 1600 confirm these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage originated in the early medieval church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church, furnished and occupied with a priest, remained owner of this church and could also bequeath this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">This was accompanied by the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The Greatest of the two barred on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly acquired bell was first heard in 1692, but had to be handed over later during World War II in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">During the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648), the windows were smashed and the bells were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops were stationed near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and the church's chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from audiobooks.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilary church was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Eve in 1834, a storm split the bell tower and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortunes, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the still existing tower was preserved as a witness to the 750 year old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem maintain the Hilarius facility by Dieter Dockhorn as successor to Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">The organisers invite the friends and supporters of Tumarc on Sunday, July 16th, to the sixth serenade on the old cemetery on St. Hilary's Chapel.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is arranged by the combo of the Kepler gymnasium of Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Vorsteher Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>

<seg id="507">It is unlawful.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of the authorization on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette no wind turbines could have been approved, since at the time in Viersen there was only a wind power concentration zone at the border to Schwalmtal.</seg>
<seg id="509">In this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are principally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city.</seg>

<seg id="511">Although the city of Viersen had passed a second wind force concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier - but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved the district government of Düsseldorf, because of a fault.</seg>

<seg id="519">With regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday did not intend to comment on the argumentation of the association "Boisheim."</seg>
<seg id="520">The NEW, a subsidiary of the NEW, is planning on an area at the Boisheimer Nette construction of four 200-metre-high wind turbines.</seg>
<seg id="521">Already last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectare site.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be met - equivalent to about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-seniors.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW $wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer Viersen's Town Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind park near Aachen and a participation in a wind power plant in Übach-Palenberg, Kreis Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="684">Quantity: normally in steinfurt in the furniture market, once a week I help here in Greven in the furniture bridge.</seg>
<seg id="685">And I also worked at school in an open day-to-day business.</seg>

<seg id="693">I realized for myself that it's the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else to work with people.</seg>

<seg id="904">The works on the three bridges of the Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg are proceeding well.</seg>
<seg id="905">On Wednesday, a seven-ton concrete section was installed on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="906">"" "" "" "we are very good at the time, it runs fine," "" "said Reinhold Leicht, Construction Manager at the Traffic and Transport department at the Regierungspräsidium Freiburg." ""</seg>
<seg id="907">In April the works started at the same time on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="908">The end of the building is scheduled for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule will be met.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge coming from Schramberg leads through the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is a concrete arch bridge made of concrete, which is clad with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 metres.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to guarantee the stability and the stability of the road, the three buildings are now thoroughly redeveloped.</seg>
<seg id="914">The two other bridges lead over Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are made of red Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, or 10.60 metres long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach was now on Wednesday mornings on the north side a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a marginal fixing that is also used as operating distance.</seg>
<seg id="919">On Friday, a 2.20-meter wide bridge can be used on the southern part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway is supposed to be gone.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing about this is that it concerns finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridging caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">Special tact feeling has necessitated laying cables through the structure in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">There is also a fibre-optic cable where many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">Local residents were informed in advance of the work by handouts on the project.</seg>
<seg id="926">In addition, fish and crayfish first had to be fished off.</seg>
<seg id="927">For the bridges between the building yard and the collecting pond in the direction of Schramberg the traffic is lane-lane by a traffic light.</seg>
<seg id="928">For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden" is fully closed.</seg>

<seg id="1120">I expect the competent authorities to clear the facts quickly and comprehensively.</seg>
<seg id="1121">How the financial rules of football on Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenditure of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, as the executive organization that oversees the European game has the power to prohibit teams from gaining access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules launched in 2011 by the UEFA mean that PSG has to prove that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without significant losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million US dollars) to purchase the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make the money loose so that Neymar undertakes and brings him to a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the wealthy master family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs are not allowed to spend a lot of money for the purchase of players, but must be subject to legitimate revenue sources that allow them to break the break-even point in their football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success were effectively deceiving and risking to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentrating on the debts of clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a harder affair.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP publishing period, which runs until 2018, clubs can take losses of EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen out of favour by the Presidency in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to be deterred by excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"surely, FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a package, it can distribute the amount for the accounting period over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the debt recovery will be reported for the next five years amounting to 44,4 million euros in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 brought the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million (at that time $82 million), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs who could try to outwit their financial view by inflating their income by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not allow this to be regarded as legitimate incomes.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This is exactly what happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the PSA sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar via payments from the World Cup 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 insisted that Neymar won the World Cup ambassador and could easily find out such a maneuver for the UEFA regulators.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive to observe any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG on Neymars Transfer, announcing on Thursday the people who were familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not competent to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million with a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">Accounts for the last fiscal year need to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymars arrival a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and jersey sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signing of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players and tried to prevent Neymar's move by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"" "" "" "it is a clear case of" "" "financial doping" "" "with the club and the state," "" "said the president of La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's last ownership of PSG." ""</seg>

<seg id="1212">On Wednesday mornings in the Schwarzwald-Baar district, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, numerous objects were searched.</seg>
<seg id="1213">At the same time, 15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warrants against them.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, decreased in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court Apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," Joanne says.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I looked for something comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with her and made an offer this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">"" "that was my requirement," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">"" "" "" "Erfan had to think creatively in order to solve the issue." ""</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend over." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">Not only was it possible to build a simple platform, but to place the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below. "</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with lots of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">A classic copper light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area for the mezzanine.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Moutain lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored in order to make it work for a longer time.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and jars of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folding kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering went inside," "" "explains Erfan from the steel reinforced, veneered MDF board." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it's very important, so if you push the door very easily."</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "at the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is appreciated," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on soil size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to increase the floor space while using high-quality materials that give the room its luxury advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things that touch you and therefore help create emotional ties in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you do not love the electrical outlets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they don't play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself by a good design and an increased square meter of some standard into something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute because of one of the biggest real estate empire of Victorias worth over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De LUTIS lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to retire from family business since 2014, but a sharp debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the Brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars since the 1973 family bought a shop at Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There, the Westco family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money was invested in real estate and the De LUTIS portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping malls in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">After an agreement with her late father, Colin - by Paul described as the "principal operator and the dominant personality" in the De LUTIS family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file says that this means that Colin has assets worth $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The distribution of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "the divisions suggested by Colin have left him with what I considered the best objects," "" "he wrote in 2015 in a first Affidavit." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed placements, the Supreme Court hearing took place.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers now also struggle for control over the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but appeals to Paul to manage some possessions incompetent.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early affidavit, which was submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "my Italian inheritance tells us that the family is the most important priority," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs rise in the case with hundreds of pages with affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both sides held law firms.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De LUTIS and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy and delicatessen shops from the late 1950's and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970's.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the first jean shop of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">"" "Colin says he started when he was" "" "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De LUTIS says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to give her property back to her sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"" "" "" "Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land on trial," "" "she wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De LUTIS group, whereas Colin claims that Mark has been paid 10 million dollars while leaving the company and Luke 26 million.</seg>
<seg id="1379">"" "Luke and Mark are, thus Paul says" "" "has become bitter about the conditions of their financial division." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin withheld back very much, although he was a former AFL board member and after a biography from 2015 Eddie McGuire was the best friend of the television star.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De LUTIS and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"" "only Colin replied by SMS to say" "" "I really can't say much" "" "because the case was before the courts." ""</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and draw our surname through the courts," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1384">In mid-2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to fulfill his brother's demands.</seg>

<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House aims to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including reports of the news media - in the hope of keeping the head on a more consistent course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"" "" "" "when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior officers on his first day of work, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump White House:" "" "bad information coming into the hands of the President." ""</seg>
<seg id="1395">"" "Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trump Relationship to TV extends back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "when candidate Trump was annoyed because of unfair exposure, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs that were to be persuaded," "" "said the former election campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February of Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "" "" "Politico Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keeping slinging slows under control, according to six former election campaigners, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay. that's okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "but the idea that slinging" "" "Twitter" "" "was ever" "" "under control" "" "is ridiculous." ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">"" "" "" "maybe these campaign officers know something we don't know - that, without their interventions, trumps would have included even more fuel." ""</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that has not sent the dump.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his employees managed to keep him away from him for a while, their efforts paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented Trump controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, consisting of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting the material that possibly promotes their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the consultant to provide the President for strategic reasons doubtful information.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press releases, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he can find out where they originate from.</seg>
<seg id="1410">This was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously issued a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a pile of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has sold false accusations in the past and has revoked them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "Trump read the article and began asking people about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldsmith added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the General Secretary of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork, which will get the dump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did this work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his consultants are still striving for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be re-opened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closing of the Hotel Birkenhof through the then Ambiente company company ltd. on April 13, 2014 some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also receipts by the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the fall of 2014, in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the district, the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation, which provided controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers from setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the municipal council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and even then spoke of serious interested parties at the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer based in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three-star-plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">You will find Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1458">At the former Hotel Birkenhof, building schuttles have been standing in front of the entrance for some time, and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renovations are carried out.</seg>
<seg id="1459">The floors were pulled out, ceilings partly broken down, old bathtubs are removed from the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single construction site.</seg>

<seg id="1462">"it's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1465">"" "everything should later become" "" "pretty bourgeois" "" "as Thomas Scherer pushes out." ""</seg>

<seg id="1467">Swimming pool, wellness area and conference room belong to the facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1468">One does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an upscale downtown level, Scherer emphasizes.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The Waldhotel Luise, with its approximately 60 rooms, wants to spread wide, explains Scherer.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Individual vacationers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="1471">He has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, the Scherer.</seg>
<seg id="1472">The ideas of the city are identical to those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">When the investment is high, Thomas Scherer doesn't want to specify exactly.</seg>
<seg id="1475">He reckons just under one million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1476">The external systems are also brought forward, which is already clearly visible.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia affair: U.S. special investigator sets out Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special genealogist Robert Mueller is said to have appointed a so-called Grand Jury after a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"" "in recent weeks, the committee has recorded the work, wrote the" "" "Wall Street Journal" "" "with respect to the people entrusted to them." ""</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper pointed out the step as a sign that Mueller extended and intensified his investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The channel CNN reported that there were already the first invitations of the committee in connection with a meeting between the scourge of oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time, purposefully intervening in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether there were agreements between the election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the focus of the investigations, several men are to stand, who acted as advisors to the republicans in the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller also examined more and more trumps in a private and business environment.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Agent has personally put Trump into the centre and suspects whether the President may have obstructed the judiciary in the course of the affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to examine present evidence in possible cases of crime and to decide whether it should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurgies are therefore also called to be indicted.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to invite people to interrogating under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN, invitations were issued which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were called upon to testify, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Besides Trump Jr., also the slingers consultant and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former election campaign manager Paul Manafort were involved in the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the exposure showed that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he wanted to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "" "" "however, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the elevation of an indictment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of new revelations, on Thursday evening, the president used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "Russia's history is a total invention," "" "said Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">"" "the theme gives the Democrats a way to" "" "feel good" "" "because they have nothing else to talk about." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special advisor, Ty Cobb, stated in a statement that he did not know about the establishment of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But this usually works in secret, he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="1506">"" "the White House advocates any action that accelerates the work of the special promoter in" "" "fair" "" "ways." ""</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that not be determined against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">I have no reason to assume that something has changed, it says further in the statement.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"" "" "" "because of this rule, accusations against Trump had been loudly loudly, he would obstruct the judiciary." ""</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June of a senate committee, Trump asked him to stop the investigation against the national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">After the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special issuer and his employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation as to whether Trump Mueller wanted to release.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent investigator of the congress, such as in the Watergate affair around the later retired President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the urging of the President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">"" "" "" "however, several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step." ""</seg>

<seg id="1525">But overall there have been a series of unusual breakdowns in the region for around 30 years, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a factor background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus was a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It is growing ever further into the sea and breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this ice shelf the balance of waxes and abrupt was disrupted a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete horseshoe is broken there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C horseshoe file is in danger, because the front edge has never been as far removed as it is now.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the iron plate is under tension and can fall apart, if a piece breaks down on a key site.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase the sea level because they float on the water and ice as much water as it results after the melting.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase sea level, but only in a small degree, the British research project writes to the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica with nearly 50,000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the widest withdrawal since the beginning of the records," "" "he confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists, whether Larsen-C-Schelfeis will grow back or fall back in the long term and possibly fall together, his colleague Adrian Luckman said: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers did not return the abortion of this giant iceberg to climate change, many kingfishers of the Antarctic Peninsula have collapsed in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long tip of the Antarctic stretches towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to the British Antarctic Survey, the Antarctic Survey's ice surface has decreased by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The rise in temperature contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Over the past 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees and thus tames into the areas where the temperature is fastest steep.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants a hourly rate at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy vacant positions, the CDU demands to stand out of the Employers' Association to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Only shortly before the summer break the Cretaceous Day has established 41 new positions in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1,100 employees and officials work for the administrative district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 trainees have left their first day of work.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The teaching positions in the circle are obviously much sought after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">There were around 620 applications for the places to be awarded this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">However, the group still lacks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">At present there are 50 vacancies at the Mettmann district.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as the powers of general administration.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and to counter the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "according to the wishes of the parties, the administration should" "" "develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is not only to cover short-term demand for skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented application shortage.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should orientate itself internally and externally, show concrete measures for cross-entry and include a training initiative, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personal problems that one did not know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "the speech is of a" "" "competition of public employers" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">In addition, there is a high number of employees who retired due to illness or age related reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1569">So it is time to act so that no more places remain unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter Roth, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the common motion with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He had long since made a lazy surprise in the county, when he publicly challenged personnel expenses and stunned the other parties.</seg>
<seg id="1572">People want all possibilities to be reviewed which enable exiting from the communal employers' association.</seg>
<seg id="1573">"if we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term, the administration of the county with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county-affiliated towns - should aim at a hourly rate," says peoples.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In doing so, the CDU, the employees and officials, is trying to pay better than it actually envisages the tariff bill for the public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money only exist when switching to a higher level, which is oriented towards professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle grew more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago, new premises had to be set up, in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitution Protection Act.</seg>
<seg id="1578">Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Councillor Thomas Hendele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy exacerbates the tone of NGOs' rescue boats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"" "" "" "Italy has warned NGOs that use bailout boats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they must not continue this unless they comply with new rules for their operations." ""</seg>
<seg id="1581">"" "" "" "if NGOs do not sign a new Code of Conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," "" "said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa." ""</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnetis's warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German aid organization 'Youth Rettet' because their squad had worked effectively with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to express its views on the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "for us, saving human life remains our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue area at the moment," "" "said the organization in a statement on social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "we can only assess any accusations currently raised after collecting all the information and assessing the situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Youth Rettet' who supervised Iuventa since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is thought that its crew takes dinghy migrants aboard, which are supplied to them directly by human traffickers, and that smugglers can go off so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file whose content was published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of overthrowing the authority of the Italian Coastguard, the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventra must have an Italian police officer on board, who supervises their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">"" "the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable as they would not bring" "" "essential changes or disabilities" "" "of their rescue actions." ""</seg>

<seg id="1594">"" "" "" "Minniti has meanwhile said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures had declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguards and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit." ""</seg>

<seg id="1599">There were three friendly guides available.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and Weinfest from Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelchapel above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">Observation points followed, partly on towers, from which one could look far above the Pfälzerwald forest and the upstream layers.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there were always longer climbs, for which long trials were rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to Saline and to the Wurstmarkt folk festival.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Again, there was a lookout spot at the lookout, connected by "flew" trials and moderate ascents.</seg>
<seg id="1607">During the last two days a lot of altimeters were announced.</seg>

<seg id="1609">In Bad Dürkheim the bikers inhaled healing brine in the open air inhalatorium.</seg>
<seg id="1610">New town was also controlled.</seg>

<seg id="1612">Console instead of grass - Bundesliga is equipping itself for E-Sport</seg>
<seg id="1613">Are the sports stars sitting in front of computer consoles in the future, instead of being weathered by wind and weather over the stadium lawn?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact is: e-sport has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gaits included.</seg>
<seg id="1615">These have also recognized the first federal ligades who are increasingly involved in this field.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 followed and finally the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in mid-July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract.</seg>

<seg id="1619">Next weekend, the FIFA World Cup organises the first "Interactive club World Cup," in which the gamers of different clubs compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Besides Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen currently advises an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds in particular, that young people still go to the stadium in the future," said the 52-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="1624">And: the clubs were trying to conquer all sorts of markets, especially the Asian ones.</seg>
<seg id="1625">With prominent e-athletes under the contract they could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the Bundesligamnesian to Asia.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">At E-Sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike," or the FIFA World Cup will be fought at a competitive level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">As in normal sport, leagues have long since become established, in which the pros compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And for the Asian Games in 2022, E-Sport is already part of the official programme.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it really a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the performance is certainly getting used to the ordinary.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobous has also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sporthochschule in Cologne, e-sports is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions, which can also be found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">It also requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a rapid reactivity.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should train not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to the nutrition.</seg>

<seg id="1637">"" "but Frobous also sees problems:" "" "doping is becoming more and more an issue." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1638">Controls should be difficult to perform in online games, and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing.</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientist emphasises the high integrative effect of e-sport in a positive way.</seg>
<seg id="1640">The players are internationally on the road, that's like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers.</seg>

<seg id="1642">In 2016, 50 million euros have been put into practice in Germany, mainly via advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="1643">In three years, turnover is expected to be 130 million.</seg>
<seg id="1644">This is little against the 2.4 billion euro of the Bundesliga.</seg>

<seg id="1751">One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.</seg>

<seg id="1755">European automakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>

<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>

<seg id="1784">Even in China Mordillo found many fans.</seg>

<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is shrinking because of the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and due to diseases transmitted diseases, causing scientists and farmers who try to find solutions, great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, an expert of the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change that has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the fall.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>

<seg id="1802">Lavender oil attracts not only tourists, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">The solutions that are considered are better water distribution and the slowdown of evaporation from the soil, but also the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly Riodoce usually meet Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists are discussing what feels more secure: they are supposed to take their children to the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary to submit perceptions and gut feelings.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of standing on the government's payroll or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the mess of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no respite from violence, and while the bodies are piling up throughout the country, more and more journalists are in attendance: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto resigned in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her editor and her inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," "" "said Valdez in one of his many books about violence in connection with drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep although his presence is everywhere - a big photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a Sonder-Attorney-Office was set up in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, only two criminal proceedings were initiated, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, journalists are rarely confronted by journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uncomforting, even though the terrain is even more traitor.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know why, we all strust." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">In the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and was shot 12 times on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelfth River."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter ran away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But there is nothing but silence on the topic of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest in January and the surrender to the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, as rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa one or more people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story mausoleums for drug kingdoms that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">"" "forget for a minute that there is a state of" "" "tranquility" "" "if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drug trade routes in the United States." ""</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken by the fault that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First there was the publication of an interview with Damasco Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, guerrillas bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own security after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He served as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined up with five colleagues for the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars in shares.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the drug problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">With time, the newspaper thickened a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-fitting examinations with no fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to deal with.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors-Cabot Award" for her reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee on the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever she was leading.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up voluntarily that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to continue living," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ award." ""</seg>

<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun-bird, who could curb like a dockworker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">"" "now they ask," "" "Was his love for routine destruction?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1863">"" "" "" "these things were not allowed," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>

<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>

<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the space where the staff of Riodoce met for safety training, no cellphones suddenly were allowed. days earlier it became known that Spyware, which is exclusively sold to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for protection against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a middle class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen, who the Governor himself described as untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are actually under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has spent three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of former well-known Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposes on state expenditures focusing on the home town of the Governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group going through one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, a block away from the prosecutor's office.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter found out of public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician governed by the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI) which ruled almost the whole century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-calibre cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this place, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.</seg>

<seg id="1886">Valdez's office became a storage room for signs and stickers to protest against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and went to a demonstration on the next morning for another journalist on the prosecutor's office.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is theirs.</seg>

<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case.</seg>
<seg id="1892">During a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day following the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and letting them kill because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since then asked her to be rearranged by the government because she is worried that her anger violated her objectivity.</seg>

<seg id="1928">His unbelievably well preserved condition has startled researchers that describe it as "really remarkable."</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, armored herbivores are the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk when he was buried in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that seemed to be out of the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2.500 Pound (1,100 kg) heavy earth clumpy.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you blink only a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is visible.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"" "" "" "it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this herbivorous, although it is covered with a armor and resembles a changing tank, probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as a counter-coating, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed us to get better in its surroundings and to avoid its enemies say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million-year-old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier made headlines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>

<seg id="1942">The astonishing conservation of the print allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter-shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It points out that the dinosaur was driven by enough pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution favoured the concealment of the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the counter-shading - think of deer, zebras or shingles - are much smaller and vulnerable than loot, which signalizes that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "" "" "strong predator behaviour on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur carnivores of the Cretaceous period must have been," "" "said Brown." ""</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about his life, including his preserved intestinal content to find out what he has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on the back to the seabed.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time Alberta was as warm as South florida today, and rivers and oceans probably widespread far inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but remains preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal," Brown said.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"" "" "" "the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early Cretaceous period." ""</seg>
<seg id="1954">You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you just squint a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is sleeping. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The Cretaceous period was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his frightening ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons weightless monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta has sunk after death in the sea and was mumified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he was buried on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the best preserved dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that protruded from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores were washed ashore by western Canada, until a flooded river flooded into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater cremation of the dinosaur preserved his armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the Haustallions still cover bumpy tank plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as' rare as a win in the lottery.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy tank plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">His right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upwards.</seg>

<seg id="1972">Heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8: nearly 30 vehicles are wrapped up in a mass arambolage.</seg>
<seg id="1973">There are numerous wounded, long legs and Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1974">About 20 people were injured on the highway Stuttgart-Munich (A8) on Thursday afternoon at a mass arambolage.</seg>
<seg id="1975">According to the first information of the police, between the outlets of Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district of Aichach-Friedberg) there were nearly 30 vehicles during a thunderstorm, including trucks.</seg>
<seg id="1976">At first, no information is available about the exact number of injured persons.</seg>
<seg id="1977">A police spokesman said it was light to moderate injuries.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large number of rescue vehicles had been charged at the accident site.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">In the direction of Munich, a ten-kilometre-long backstage was formed.</seg>
<seg id="1981">As an AZ reporter reports, it also occurred on the counter-road to massive disabilities - through numerous Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The fire brigade noted the characteristics of the vehicle handlebars, which now have to be reckoned with sensitive punishments.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Shortly after 18: 45 a second accident took place on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.</seg>
<seg id="1984">There was a collision between a car transporter and a passenger car.</seg>

<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced: nothing similar is sitting in the train and sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or you are deepening into his work and has just a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: bufff.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Comes the conductor and wakes an unsuspecting or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Ticket inspection.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are soon over.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket inspection.</seg>
<seg id="1994">You simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your seat and use it to validate your ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Currently, a test operation operates on two routes.</seg>
<seg id="1996">"" "" "" "if the offer arrives, we will expand it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1997">"" "it will be expected to be available in many other long-distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year," "" "said a railway speaker." ""</seg>
<seg id="1998">"" "" "" "comfort Check-in" "" "calls the train ticket devaluation without conductor." ""</seg>
<seg id="1999">In order to be able to use it, however, some requirements must be fulfilled: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to have an online ticket - what already most passengers do.</seg>
<seg id="2001">It also has to be purchased via the train, the DB Navigator app, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2002">Last but not least, you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"" "because the" "" "comfort check-in" "" "works like this: you get into the train, calling his ticket to" "" "My Tickets" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2004">A button for electronic devaluation appears with the test customers.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train companions receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">If the train companion comes to place at the ticket check in place Y, he knows that there is a passenger with an already paid online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">One can therefore continue to sleep, continue working, keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2008">"check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"" "" "" "if you want to travel relaxed without ticket inspection by our train crew staff, please check the DB navigator yourself." ""</seg>

<seg id="2011">"" "second plus:" "" "and our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2012">Those who often run by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, the ticket controls are among the biggest annoyances.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because oftentimes you have, in any case, one of the fellow travellers not all the documents you need to devaluation online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the identity card is missing or otherwise a document that must be presented.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between the train attendant and passenger, which leads to bad mood in the part or greater room and delays in the control of one's own tickets and takes the conductor over time to take care of other concerns.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And also only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Additional numbers on the same route have not yet been activated.</seg>
<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "the Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Only one day after arriving in New York City, she was sitting in St. Louis Giorene on the bed of an airbnb apartment she rented and scrolling through Facebook on her phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled across a mail from someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"" "" "" "the police have just killed an 18 year old child, and it's still on the street," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused as nobody else posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the handle @ theePharoah was constantly being retweaving on her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rapper from the area of St. Louis was about to tweeten the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Browns's lifeless body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"" "" "" "that's wild," "" "Ferrell thought." ""</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new to them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She put her cell phone off to return to tweet via people on the Canfield-Drive in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of police band and people shouting, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father who bore a shield with the inscription: "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed at which a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"" "in another video, she said," "" "another policeman assured his rifle saying," "" "I'll kill you... animals all" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"" "" "" "this is not usual," "" "Ferrell remembered her statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="2035">"" "" "" "this is not the type of murder we have used to and which we can call typical." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment I felt chills.</seg>
<seg id="2037">"" "I was angry and cried." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 11pm she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience that exists from the perspective of people living in community and filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">As Ferrell, with her daughter, who wore a flower-dress and a matching crown, drove to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning "about the black experience and black state."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "" "she remembered what she was saying." ""</seg>
<seg id="2044">"" "" "" "we are going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right." ""</seg>
<seg id="2045">"" "I could not take them away," "" "said Ferrell later." ""</seg>
<seg id="2046">"" "" "" "what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past." ""</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and be drawn up in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed not only activism and organisation, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism, she is no different from the next black women's child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"" "I feel I would be doing a bad job to keep them away from it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived at Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non-accusation by Officers Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter joined together with a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"" "" "" "my activism completely changed after 9 August," "" "she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities." ""</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">"" "everything has come." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">"" "said Folayan, she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to" "" "document" "" "what happened." ""</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "a question came into mind:" "" "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">This scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">"" "as Folayan recently stated in an interview," "" "We heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan has already collaborated with the co-director, Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt Insassen.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His engagement took Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years following Brown's shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"" "" "" "this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us. we're talking," "" "said Davis." ""</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "that was the main thing for me as these people are represented, for so I shall be represented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">"" "the goal was not to concentrate on Ferrara's experience - to show that the movement" "" "is not a Messiah" "", "but a community that comes together," "" "said Folayan - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film." ""</seg>
<seg id="2068">"" "as a result, documents of" "" "Whose Streets" "" "show unexpected personal aspects of Ferrara's life as she falls in love with her wife." ""</seg>
<seg id="2069">"" "" "" "I felt like naked," "" "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrara's story repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, who after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 marked the film "Blackmore Matter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"" "" "" "black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether," "" "said Ferrell," "" "and so we are constantly fighting on different fronts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2074">"" "black, gay women have to bear the brunt of everything." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "Folayan agreed to note that" "" "the movement is genuinely maintained by black women and many black women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">"" "however, it insists that" "" "this is not an affirmative type of action," "" "where Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity." ""</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook that energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="2078">"" "" "" "it is no coincidence although it was at the forefront because in a life on these crossings as a black, gay woman is so much at stake." ""</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racist connections between the community and the police continue to exist.</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "Dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people even though it hasn't been built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping mall at the southern end of the pedestrian precinct has been splitting the population into proponents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The topic hardly leaves one cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"" "the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page" "" "Volksfreund Bitburg" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one to the bit gallery says: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be real great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "no human being" (Siggi Betzen) or simply: "megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While supporters believe that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, as well as the other businesses benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed out.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the plot where the farmers market hall stands, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the start of construction work will be finished.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery-makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - in Beda-Platz, with the possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">"" "Simone Room:" "" "for many years we have been shopping almost every week in the farmers market hall." ""</seg>

<seg id="2124">A fitting similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheeks and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year custodial sentence after revealing official diplomatic reports about WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Becoming resemblance (A matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and pioneering dissident whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg originated from the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and made out of the 30 portraits, as someone with these genomic data could look, a sharp, albeit a somewhat intellectual commentary not only about the formation of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since puberty, was convicted of 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison, her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white Selfie, in which Manning obviously sits on a driver's seat and carries a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was just about the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"" "" "" "they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while they were in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "" "said Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition." ""</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so contact Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal British effecaries who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a comic "suppressed images," illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who predicted a future where the President of Chelsea would translate judgment and it would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas would demand was a welcome kind of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender forces to find new tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid splits he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery, Manning demanded an end to the "automatic fragmentation, whose basis is gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandfold of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg was hoping to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), how amazingly similar, at least in biological aspects, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with it is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how open genetic data are for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also visible.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic-novel.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning how she emerges with a hands-free hands on the hands of the United States Disciplinary Learn as King Kong.</seg>

<seg id="2154">Manning hasn't seen the show personally, just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it, she will be greeted by the masks in the middle of the room, from her own genomic simulaceres, which assemble like hordes of protesters.</seg>

<seg id="2184">The PM added the second part of the WADA roadmap to comply with the code, which describes the criteria for reintegration of RUSADA and recently published on the organization's website.</seg>

<seg id="2189">"" "in reference to the matter, Mutko said:" "" "we carry out the investigation as our anti-doping system has made a mistake." ""</seg>

<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure your luck with your e-commerce startup, but the polls didn't work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - worse - deceiving.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="2208">She has called people from the outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new Human Resources Start-up race is growing in order to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, provide special groups and demographic groups, provide employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases whistleblowers allow to bypass the C-suite executives and to turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where's the Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up GLINT, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said they had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to snap surveys and surveys from certain teams, it provides a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low grant outcomes - so that you can drill down why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies are coming to see that they have to stay at the forefront of workplace culture so that you don't become the next user who has been involved in scandals, since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of nuisance where those who have spoken were punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like GLINT this wish is an overview of a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">Global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw a growing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber case in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has nearly 600 clients including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently signed up as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Like GLINT, Convercent creates tailor-made "pulse" surveys, gather confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline, with which employees can report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And if the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the public opinion court has grasped the regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company finds its employees badly treated or behaved unethical, it may experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee turnover and complaints, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, has appointed Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">In the past, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or e-mail for the company headquarters, submit formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a timidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now that the company uses Convercent, problems that were previously concealed by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states have been identified and addressed faster, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair placement.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience with employment," "" "said Vitrano, who leads the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders from employment litigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies started taking Ethics, Values and Employees Commitment in 2002 more seriously after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "social media came to their right" "" "that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both GLINT and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">In February, Convercent received $10 million for financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzers secured $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees are more expecting from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only bets.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company that is worth their votes and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors reach retirement when their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data about employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">"" "" "" "but the data are useless if the administrators of a company do not take action." ""</seg>
<seg id="2247">Indeed, when a company asks staff after your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change is not fast enough or not at all, it can grow disappointments and demotivise employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you'll have to be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen companies who have relied too much on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "for if you don't follow associates ask themselves," "" "Have you really heard me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about this?</seg>
<seg id="2252">And if you don't care about why, why should I? "</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reped, who is now carrying out monthly polls, was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about GLINT, thus saving.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after gaining feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">With Ruby Tuesday, the company always gets new insights into the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this leads to better binding of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"if you are not obligated to create a culture of transparency, you will lose the people," said Vitrano.</seg>

<seg id="2375">Even before the end of the year, on the dilapidated route, on which the tourist train runs, is to be built.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In order to secure the future of the race-platform shuttle in the long term, construction work on the route will begin again this year according to the Ministry of Transport.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"" "" "" "with the decision to further order and renovate the route Ilmenau-Rennsteig, the country admits to this particularly important link for tourism," "" "declared State Secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt." ""</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it won't be even crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots will come.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible robotics) has published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must start taking her ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people are making fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more frequently," "" "said Mr. Sharkey at the publication of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"" "the user can" "" "adapt" "" "his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the nipples to the type or the color of his fingernails." ""</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it is even more disturbing since many robots have the" "" "personalities" "" "that would make a stepper woman look progressively." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">For example, the RealBotix robot enables its users to adapt their robot to the properties that they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex-Robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as Frigid Farrah, who conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as much as possible," "" "enthuses the website of True Companion." ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day, she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, be fixed on conversation or she can be" "" "in mood" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when one goes a step on Frigid (called here: reluctant) Farrah, trouble one the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his site, True Companion Roxxxy is compared with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxxy?" it says on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their origin and increasing refinement point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will certainly not hold sex robots, and while the FRR noted their increasing popularity, they nevertheless remain on the verge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what sickens out of the marginal zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not odd or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is however a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time where women's rights are threatened by the world in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have women sexually attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most deterrent aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') are not the graphic images, the entwined body and the sophisticated eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human, imitating the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, when it comes to their" "" "personalities," "" "the robots are not real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no intermediation or background story, nothing that hinders independence or anything that could disturb the fantasy of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are fake slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to put it in the narration of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Do umps affect great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney an epitome of the healthy sense of man</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a trump-wisdom of the Trump-era that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate have split families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the USA with advice about how to deal with the horror of the confused relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all reportedly exert ourselves to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noted is the power of dumps to bring families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a leftist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House everyone whom she knows, including Republican kinship, with whom she fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite peculiarly on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">Around the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it is in a further context that this also involves considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and "trump," we refer to the creepy possibility that his bibs no longer have to be repelled.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump republicans "normalize" the right wing, suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison with its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Today I find myself surrounded by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked like) - both in comparison to Trump in fact occur as very mild criminal offences.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must only be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the carousels in New York's Park department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city when you don't need any caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are knurled and the animals twist to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate-perishing music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">As many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines are too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city doesn't do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not quite across the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the Theme Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">But Central Park carousel is still a strange magic experience, because here two-year-old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-year-old can go to it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have assessed the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what a neutral exchange should be, but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was apologetically grin while I tired the experience of submitting my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius with chest pains transferred from prison to hospital</seg>
<seg id="2450">Pistorius, for the second time, left the prison for a hospital visit.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year, he was hospitalized due to the treatment of cuts to his wrists, according to the prison authorities, according to a case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistorius was sentenced to a first death sentence due to murder after an appeal by the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp during the early morning of Valentine's Day 2013 by shoving her through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed he had his girlfriend for a nightly intruder hiding in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors announced their intention to appeal this time to the six-year custodial sentence of Pistorius Appell, of which they said they were too indulgent.</seg>
<seg id="2456">"" "" "" "the National Prosecution Authority said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year." ""</seg>

<seg id="2491">How exactly does the software update take place?</seg>
<seg id="2492">Do diesel drivers have to participate in the promotion?</seg>

<seg id="2535">Roland Wacker, Haslach City Builder, will retire next year.</seg>
<seg id="2536">The job is already written out - but suitable candidates are rare.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Wacker Stadtbaumeister has been a city builder for the past 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work is still great fun for him, as he conveys in the press conference.</seg>
<seg id="2539">He reports on varied, but also demanding tasks waiting for his followers.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time it is surprising that no application has yet to fulfil the requirements profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or a civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">In keeping with the regular periods of dismissal, there should still be enough time for a revision.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach works for the administrative community as the Lower Building Law Body, the applicant has to present relevant conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If they can no longer fill them, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But city closeness is important to the city and itself, says Wacker, who reports from a good working climate as well as a good mood between authorities and citizens.</seg>

<seg id="2562">Continuity is not only important for a good working climate, but also for the further shaping of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2563">According to the town of Haslach, anyone who wants to be heir to Roland Wacker should be able to present a completed study as a diploma engineer or bachelor with the subject of architecture and have good knowledge in the fields of construction planning and construction planning law.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">However, a new study claims the exact opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition affecting approximately 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United States causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While the affected person is usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products in order to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestinal system.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells in the gut are patrolling to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are evened by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the equilibrium leads too far in the direction of inflammation, an inflammatory bowel disease can result.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, it was found that a kind of tolerance stimulating immune cell is found in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a food intolerant to tryptophan encourages more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus, if the same system also works in people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan was examining a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe that was separated, but had not had this.</seg>
<seg id="2593">She suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbial mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were sequenced and six bacterial species were found that were present in mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were taken up in a sterile environment so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. Matteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria impact the immune system, the researchers incorporated L. Matteri in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerable cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as an idol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice's food, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan states that people have the same tolerable cells as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammations on the inner surface of the intestines." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan values can lead to an extension of this population in the presence of L. reuteri. "</seg>

<seg id="2650">And because in crisis communications he got pretty much wrong as to what to do wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Since then, Scholz has fought for his political survival.</seg>
<seg id="2652">So now Stephan Weil.</seg>
<seg id="2653">Because of the VW exhaust atmosphere and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Lower Saxony prime minister had already been criticised for a long time.</seg>

<seg id="2672">Those who want to renovate his house in the years can soon get support from the country.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of Steg city development informed on this Wednesday in sensations.</seg>
<seg id="2674">At the beginning of the information session, Schindler once again gave a review of what happened to date.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Since 1991, I have been giving in sentiments sanitation areas.</seg>
<seg id="2676">At that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, the previous sanitations are a "successful project" - it is important to promote inner development and not only to open up new areas of construction.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, the Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe has received the information that there will be a redevelopment zone III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The funding amount was 833 333 euros, of which 500,000 euros would come from the country, the rest of the community sensitivities.</seg>

<seg id="2682">"" "one will, as Schindler continue, investigate where the" "" "old" "" "houses are." ""</seg>
<seg id="2683">But it also plays a role as to whether there is interest in the planned area at all.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If necessary, the regional boundaries could then also be postponed.</seg>

<seg id="2686">"" "Keller presented the contents of the federal government programme" "" "Social City" "", "in which the renovations would then be carried out." ""</seg>
<seg id="2687">The core of the program is the revitalisation of inner cities, improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="2688">The measures would be carried out objective, that is, per plot.</seg>
<seg id="2689">The rehabilitation area would then finally be defined as a statute.</seg>

<seg id="2692">In November or December, the rules of the association shall be carried out as soon as possible, so that the restructuring will begin next year.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann subsequently declared that every commune had to perform the foreseen preliminary investigations.</seg>
<seg id="2694">The aim is to evaluate the urban development of the situation and to decide when it will be rehabilitated and to what extent.</seg>

<seg id="2715">The White House's decision to fly a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American production last month, costs taxpayers according to the data of the military entrusted to the TIME magazine up to $24,000.</seg>
<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programmes.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries.</seg>
<seg id="2718">The helicopter, which was manufactured in Connecticut, was issued next to a yacht of Maine, a fire engine from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The military bureau of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or cargo, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superiors, the Deputy naval commander for aviation.</seg>
<seg id="2721">The message indicated that the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn for the event at 3 o'clock in the morning, and so long, until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on this evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the flight departure from the White House should be delayed due to the restriction of service hours a second crew would be needed for the return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">The original flight crew was during the event at the helicopter while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane.</seg>
<seg id="2724">From the records provided by the TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was required.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act forbids federal employees to use state property for political purposes.</seg>

<seg id="2742">A spokesman of Sikorsky said the company had not been involved in spreading the helicopter to the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">HMX-1 does not have budgeting records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.</seg>
<seg id="2744">According to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017, however, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is 24.380 USD per hour.</seg>
<seg id="2745">Records of the unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the cost of taxpayers to be set based on estimates for reimbursement rates is highly misleading," "" "said Walters." ""</seg>

<seg id="2749">According to a 2015 RAND study, reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but also take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract completion.</seg>

<seg id="2889">"" "the" "" "Regensburger Domspatzen" "" "report on the abuse of abuse relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann says.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement, "We are Church," declared after publication of the German press agency, he expected the former Regensburger bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, and of the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI, an apology.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would be very useful to the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret over their own layoffs or their false appreciation of the processes at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican paper" "" "Osservatore Romano" "", "on the other hand, criticised the fact that there are" "" "double standards" "" "when reporting on violence in the Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">In regard to the grips in Regensburg, no one doubt that it is "shameful and shameful acts" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation," said the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday life and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal," "" "says Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "" "we like to go to the church and it's a devotional feeding point." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "she also pointed out that in her youth" "" "punches were a very normal pedagogical means" "" "to be finished with cheeky children as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They find it unfair to apply today's standards for the past decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports of abuse incidents, Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "completely wrongly, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who authored the memorandum" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is there in the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber who was instructed by the Bishop of Regensburg?</seg>
<seg id="2904">Between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, a total of 547 "Regensburger Domspatzen" became victims of over-attacked, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it is said about Georg Ratzinger, who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg: "in summary, it can be said that, in many cases, Domkapellmeister was employed in many cases of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially in the case of high emotional appeal the punishment for the students could be more intense.</seg>
<seg id="2907">In contrast to many other defendants, however, many victims claim that many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even share positive memories with him despite violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen St Ratzinger has relieved his mind.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "incidents of violent exercise on protective fish in the Regensburger Domspatzen" "" "gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "for one, many students highlight his" "" "humanity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it also appears to be a cholerician and perfectionist who became more tangible in the greener when a domain record didn't produce top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as a biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the rear, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is found in it at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or co-operation in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the pre-school were also expropriated outside his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">At best it is possible to reproach him, to experience it too late or to have taken first hints seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the" "" "Domsplitter" "" "school, on which he worked, was felt by virtually all respondents as" "" "redemption," "" "" "" "heaven" "" "and" "" "better world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">The vast majority of his pupils, Georg Ratzinger, also give a very excellent testimony, describes him as "warm hearted," "sincere," "competent" and "understandable," as an extremely good-natured teacher, who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and "always surrounded by the grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complain about its perfectionism and its high emotional appeal, which also sometimes led to breakdowns.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he did not only knead with chairs and cast the keys on the floor, but also put ear-figs on the hair or ears, he had already admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, in both parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know such chastening methods as well?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced that in a secular school, a state high school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what it is about in this report, namely, the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the pre-school, this is admittedly bagatelles.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether his fame and role as a brother of Benedict XVI has to do with the fact that many media have just rushed to him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">In the Bavarian pope many who have never understood him are still working diligently.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, in connection with the report, a great deal was reported on the subject of abuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger find any involvement or co-operation with regard to sexual abuse in the final report?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claim to have entrusted themselves to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to talk about it with my father or mother," "" "said an officer on behalf of the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in educating sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they were not even familiar with parents and siblings, then certainly not a conductor, who, professionally, would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen-Schüler Ratzinger assume role with regard to misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student said so: "regarding sexual abuse... I don't see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... also for really absurd, to assume that it seems to him... Busters have opened more haunting or even more clearly or even more than their parents, dormitory managers, trusted teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus the report comes to the very clear conclusion:" "" "that the students and / or their surroundings were entrusted to him in the run-up could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is thus acquitted of any co-knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="2943">He cannot be accused of not preventing him or having brought him to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these disgusting crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media, much of" "" "violent excesses" "" "was to be read at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domkapellmeister, Georg Ratzinger, is accused of" "" "look away" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael hesemann: that's the big problem in reporting everything and blended into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, right in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is exactly the misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is a clean separation: between the pre-school and the high school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and excessive violence as well as, we say, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, i.e. also for four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir director of the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were maimed and malformed, and suffered horribly, were all taken on the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where there must be really scandalous conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them, Domkapellmeister, Georg Ratzinger, had nothing to do, because he didn't get the boy until they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on this, as most witnesses stress, the theme" "" "pre-school" "" "is taboo." ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradisiac" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this is also true for Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" "" "many victims appreciated the common humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even combine positive memories with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">At most, the blame still remains to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was reported from the states at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he had just started to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not working and was responsible (as the witness) did not want to hear, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger rigorously shut the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which even reproduced the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out that the punishment practice continues to be practised in the pre-school." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Even in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was, as test punishments were long ago forbidden in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that they occurred in a legal grey area, as each of us probably knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to estimate where those affected might be exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That is just not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the penalty for schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis stated that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hesemann: we historians talk about the" "" "pitfalls of anachronism" "", "i.e. the danger of judging the past according to today's moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But of course this does not apply to sexual abuse that was intimidating at all times, and not for what has been burned in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond what is usual at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all awful and I'm glad that it will finally work up.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time, I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Its means of disciplining and punishment, i.e., to pull the ear and to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When corporal punishment was then forbidden, he was strictly adhered to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "what picture of his Regensburger time did Georg Ratzinger play in conversations with you for the book" "" "My brother the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject matter of testing also go to language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI says from his perspective, the Domspatzen just played a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not at all hide the fact that he conducted a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said: without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditioned discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world drink from the hitherto rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and sweets alone, one does not even make a big singer from unruly boys and above all success, regardless of the area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you experience for Georg Ratzinger during the talks with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through work on the book and beyond that, I have met Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, basic, deeply believing and heart-loving people, from whom you can't imagine that he could do just a fly a little.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get in contact with, like many former Domspatzen today, 23 years after his emulation, regularly contact him, visit him, read it - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who did not forgive him until now, that he once was stern to them, are therefore clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Today most of the Domspatzen are thankful to him for having enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, sure, that may be - but also a lovable respectability, to which they still look up and worship them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again very clearly: all that you submit to him are educational methods which were then the order of the day.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is most unjust, a man just because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat.</seg>
