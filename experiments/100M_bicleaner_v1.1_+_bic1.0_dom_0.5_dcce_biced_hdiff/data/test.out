28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in a local shopping mall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he could not imagine anyone who would hurt him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , it went up again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ pse found on Wednesday morning in West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , sharing the Judi@@ cial Department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigations are underway .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , shared the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had caught his dream job as a cook at the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over his death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are at this difficult time with Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gali@@ cia noted that Frank lived initially in host@@ els , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things went up for him finally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a friend , &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO .
Louis Gali@@ cia said that he could not imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a big heart .
combining his kind with his family was to make us cook something , prepare dinner for us , &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia .
he never wanted to take part in any kind of dispute .
he was the brother who swa@@ m with the river .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond who ligh@@ tened every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information on the case will call the SF@@ PD to call the SF@@ PD under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
this has made Hollywood star in an interview un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always stuck in drawers or get stuck from the outside label that has little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to be always perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , these things are more sn@@ are to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as explained in the current Cos@@ m@@ opolitan .
most of all , the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , vor@@ m TV with loose de@@ bris and Mexican food , is in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women do not have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new movie &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is no child &apos;s play &quot; Ani@@ ston is to be seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film will be available from August 25th .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger looked for a little variety with some colleagues with a ride on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sport pyrami@@ de &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their holidays , they hun@@ ted in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p home to the feeding trou@@ ghs .
a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and thus the riding career ended again .
on Saturday Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer ever was - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses .
he had his family run over the system of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even look for photo purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and with it also with CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports crew handed over the gold sports pyramid to the man from An@@ hausen in the course of a small gala .
there is no lack of awards for the symp@@ athetic athlete .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ horn lau@@ rel leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen already bl@@ amed him .
the 18th prize @-@ winner of the sports pyramid is long .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is awarded not only for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger has been fo@@ stering young talent .
and so he also received the prize money of 25,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US master winner was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame des deutschen Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the winners include athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the runner Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the jum@@ per Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um the hand@@ ball Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous society mig@@ rated to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza prize went .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and dump@@ s economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investing in infrastructure and preventing T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two U.S. presi@@ dencies , however , are un@@ affiliated with the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question .
the difference in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental philosophical difference .
that , on the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep this in doubt rather small and warns about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to control the economy and regulate death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , asser@@ ts Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will massi@@ vely drive back regulations , and he is strongly committed to a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , it has dis@@ advant@@ aged chances to open up and needs money for it .
that is why taxes for the rich would be increased , they say .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic infrastructure .
in order to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton speak almost word @-@ like .
the democratic candidate sees the largest investment in new jobs since World War II .
state investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the state @-@ critical party wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
so , there could be party @-@ internal discussions on tr@@ ump .
the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power stations and drive coal mining back in the USA .
oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , the Par@@ isian climate protection agreement wants to cancel it .
Clinton , on the other hand , wants to explicitly expand renew@@ ables and demand : &quot; a country will create the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want we to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far apart .
T@@ PP , the trans @-@ spa@@ des trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
at the same time , however , both do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - they simply want to better protect American jobs .
they should also be paid better , for example , ask Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a star@@ vation wage .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to go up , then he says he must not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
on the one hand , Tr@@ ump is standing who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth .
his critics point out that the budget deficit would only increase .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least the rich to demand that they pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is part of women who are fle@@ eing alone , almost everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby who is at the most one year old .
one has put her little son in her arm .
he looks into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the Managing Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a suppor@@ ter of social welfare services in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the issue of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are f@@ owl .
they live in the Munich North in one of the few decentr@@ alized accommodations for single @-@ wing@@ ed women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made up the institution together with Pro Famili@@ a and Munich &apos;s Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
it has recently been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - not as visitors - either .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has experience with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ahr said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death or because their families send them to Europe as a hope for hope , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; women out@@ weigh other reasons for their escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many are secretly ste@@ aling away because they see no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honour kill@@ ings , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
that drives them away .
on the run , this continues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the tu@@ gs claim a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ahr said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
those who believe that , as soon as they are in Germany , are mistaken , B@@ ahr tells us .
here too , single women in refugee camps are often regarded as inferior and ab@@ used in the worst case .
this leads to the fact that about 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich are trau@@ mati@@ zed , they appreciate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are used to saying nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they do not dare to talk openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as they often do not know to help , it needs more accommodations only for them , requires B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees .
on the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their area of competence , some answers with no .
in Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing in government shel@@ ters .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone fle@@ dged women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man for the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia , there are in some community accommodation floors or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations available exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately by men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important for men and women to be accommod@@ ated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of privacy or being housed together by men and women can make it - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all , the washing rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women , is in the study .
how much the women feel this need of protection can be read by the rush that it gives to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we &apos;ve been around that there is us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily make a second home .
assistance specialists strike : demands for new work combat measures
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; representatives of the assistance specialists have called on their union to appro@@ ve new work combat measures in their disputes relating to a new contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work action at the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC stated that ministers had ab@@ used to deal with concerns about the contract .
in July , assistance specialists and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members , who voted in favour of the elections .
in a letter to the members who were posted on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; problems , which led to the rejection of the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Executive Board voted to fully reject the proposed new treaty and call for official new negotiations on all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board today provided a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve an ongoing programme of escal@@ ating work battle measures that begins at the beginning of September .
the disputes resulted in the fact that assistance specialists took six times this year , the first general failures in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A assistance specialists Dr. Johann Mal@@ av@@ ana came back after the election to reject the agreed contract terms recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the sessions that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistants and medical students , stating that the contract should be beneficial and should be accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be forci@@ bly imported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia and Turkey : an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to proclaim an official end to the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gil@@ ded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace , I can &apos;t resist the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile was sle@@ ek and he hardly radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report a whole five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day , a newspaper wrote that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if something bad happened .
it seemed to me that his enthusiasm was rather the opposite .
but a sustainable cool@@ ness radi@@ ating by Putin showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory remarks : the down@@ fall of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was hot .
Putin denoun@@ ced and accused Ankara of being in the back of Russia .
the off@@ ence was even greater because it was celebrated by a supposed friend .
building the ve@@ to again becomes difficult , if not impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media launched a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything .
most serious were the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse that he wanted to hear from President Erdo@@ gan .
Russia was able to book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a cease @-@ fire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan first of all needs all the friends he can get after he was removed from his office last month for a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shocked him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late @-@ season rush to the Mediterranean Sea .
this week , the State television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports were allowed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ o@@ demographic put it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes are long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious at the West as it considers its response to the attempted power transfer as a weak response .
the continued res@@ ent@@ ment on the s@@ nail pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin , which is keen to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West .
the Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara for claiming support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change .
the summit in this splendid palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present one , as an analy@@ st once described to me , &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries that are viol@@ ated and badly treated by the West and are now al@@ lied .
nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played its role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents have said at the press conference that they hadn &apos;t even stri@@ ped the issue .
the president of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ise them .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ ti@@ lities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian fighter jet , it is certainly better that the two heads of states talk to each other at least again .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
according to the Board of Directors , the R@@ BS will only be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself from collap@@ sing and saving almost eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this period , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used to protect other end consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to focus on more national brands .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the decentr@@ alised head office and the stock exchange listing to Nat@@ to change .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for the retail business that will get more meaning - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand becomes our investor stamp and the brand under which our employees will be busy as we are now more to a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
I now say that we do not pursue any global goals , but rather local goals .
each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that his Six Nations sponsor@@ ship will no longer be carried out and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in his sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop into the bank of brands , because how do we focus inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the CEO .
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think , you will see many changes .
we can launch these marks again , so I think that the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches its 3,@@ 000@@ th win at New@@ market
D@@ ett@@ ori bub@@ bling champagne to a double at New@@ market , which brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th win
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday .
he set a milestone on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night on his local rac@@ et@@ rack .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey who reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the triple winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won in front of G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday night with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very humble .
D@@ ett@@ ori adop@@ ts jubil@@ ation when he fet@@ ches victory on Pre@@ dile@@ ction
two Jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career plans
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of Moder@@ nis@@ m and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone , which only a few reached before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect , which differs from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma have been enthusiastic fans for years for this kind of sport .
I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already claimed 6,000 winn@@ ings if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already ri@@ dden nearly 30 years of winning in the UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the fi@@ gu@@ re@@ head of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve @-@ wra@@ cking .
a number of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived an airplane crash and was banned from drug prohibition .
three years ago , he had difficulty at first when he returned from his six month lock , but he showed an impressive character to def@@ y his two @-@ fl@@ yers and to return to his best form .
and he is not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue at competitions up to at least fifty years of age .
Russian Putin firing Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expectedly reli@@ eved his staff of staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was many years part of the tigh@@ test of confidence in Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Repres@@ entative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement by the Krem@@ lin it is said that without giving reasons , Putin has ordered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ miss@@ al of Ivan@@ ovo from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been his deputy since 2012 , was appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in the Est@@ onian capital of Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo .
on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website it is said ( in Russian ) that he was later the Chief of Staff and Chief of Staff of the governing staff .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the government &apos;s most important task to support your work as head of state with respect to bills and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin told the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked Ivan@@ ov to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are smiling faces convincing ?
this step has made Moscow mysti@@ cal .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was long time one of the closest confi@@ dant Vladimir Putin and works like him for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
as chief of staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff will withdraw at his own request .
but despite the ridi@@ cu@@ le for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so is the result of a kind of power struggle here ?
nobody knows this at this time .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once was praised as a potential president , would like to lead Russian environmental policy , met with great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin cited on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said : &quot; it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , I could almost say - tru@@ sting jobs for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V adopted the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was president of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted the most .
once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term as Putin &apos;s third term in office viol@@ ated the Constitution .
but this post was taken by another close @-@ up ally , Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became President three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical confrontation on the set of the Los Angeles series last month .
ABC studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , who produce the series , announced their termination in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the announcement of his dis@@ miss@@ al on Thursday .
the set came to artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details of how the character Gib@@ sons from the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , is written out , is likely to be published at a later date according to the opinion of the ABC studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been involved since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love the Criminal Min@@ ds and have spent the last twelve years in my heart &apos;s blood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a communication published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hoped to be there until the end , but that will no longer be possible .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a series .
the planned transmission of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 .
ri@@ ddle around fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
an inhabit@@ ant of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish , which appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that in the 75 fish it could be about sandals that were sp@@ ed out by a fountain of fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published a video of the spectacle on Per@@ is@@ cope in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
crossing the bridge : crossing the bridge with Fi@@ fe
the project is expected to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings with the vi@@ a@@ duct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are approaching each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 metric tons of concrete and 46 ski@@ ve ropes .
the project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keith Brown already paid a visit to the construction site and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witn@@ essing an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ a@@ duct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit .
a total of almost 79 % of all the bridge decks lie in their place and the last section of the deck is given in Ros@@ y@@ th today for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , project manager at For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in each bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this fantastic project , the closure represents trend @-@ setting high and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower on the north , we had to close the still existing gap in the north or country side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern road bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massi@@ vely , since the vi@@ a@@ duct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at a slope of about 3 % .
delicate as the toler@@ ances on which the team worked were tiny - on each side they were just a few milli@@ meters .
luckily everything went very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; rescue in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; happiness still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; after they were thrown from their fishing boat to Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station announced on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T Alarm , after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat moved on from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat turned around and presented us the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rescue station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately the strong winds have blown the boat out of their reach until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a bu@@ o@@ y without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The three men who have been thrown into the water have luck un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had an emergency stop , but it released the boat from the person who controlled the boat .
someone has watched these men today .
badly hurt - man stab@@ s on his ex girlfriend
a man attacked and severely injured his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife .
as the police told yesterday , the 50 year old got the key to the apartment to get his personal things .
instead , the alcohol @-@ alcohol cul@@ pri@@ t cut off the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
and when she came to the tabernacle , he lod@@ ged twice upon her .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured in his hand and on the body .
the police could arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
while the 50 year old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother .
this then al@@ arm@@ oured his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she couldn &apos;t move him to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her companion .
on the street they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ partner .
when the two women re @-@ entered the apartment , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old turned his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who builds Braunschwei@@ gs affordable apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and the Gre@@ ens say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investors should be much stronger in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does one respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concept of action for action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but quar@@ rel is programmed .
first of all , the question is : who should build the cheap apartments ?
up to now , a provision is missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to build on urban areas , in future 20 percent of all apartments will have to exhibit as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cheap apartments can , however , also arise in the continu@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big issue in the town hall is , according to Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new residential housing development program that will cost millions and still needs to be financed must provide incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , such as Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U would like to make as few rules as possible to investors .
the left wants even harder editions for investors .
regardless of how viol@@ a , a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the housing market persi@@ sts .
if the action concept is implemented , this will take care of additional tasks in the construction management .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the program is not yet complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how to compensate for the loss of some 1300 favorable apartments , whose funding is going to exp@@ ire over the next few years ?
by 2020 alone there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , the political spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm , should now purchase pending binding from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought of bringing the apartments back into the price .
this is possible in the western city .
the problem can be solved at one stroke .
at the end of the year , Fri@@ sts are running in the West@@ stadt .
around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : they do not want the owners , the housing companies .
because the number of social housing in the western city is increased dramatically , it is removed from the goal of the so @-@ called mixing .
there should be no more concentration of socially weak in just a few parts of the city .
the Gre@@ ens expect there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although I concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that there cannot be a compromise .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it &apos;s fascinating to see how the world changes .
the fact that teenagers and children don &apos;t go outside to play , but rather prefer spending their leisure time on screens has been depl@@ eted by many over the last decade .
at Pok@@ emon Go , it &apos;s about getting people out of the sofa and being more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the television , then on video games and finally to smartphones .
so it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other .
of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s ( later a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs were created ) .
like many pop culture phenomena , interest before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand fell somewhat in the beginning of July .
the market launch in other countries has been postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that the servers over@@ loaded .
within days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ emon which can be tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the phone ) or &quot; captured &quot; can be captured .
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the del@@ usion and jumped for the look@@ out for the sofa .
in the United States , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person returns every day .
cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , which pursu@@ es 35@@ ,000 users , recently announced that within two days of the launch of the game , the number of persecuted people who train every day 30 minutes , jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who is playing Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely looks the raw data for improving performance .
many public awareness campaigns for health , people want to take &quot; 30 minutes of time &quot; to &quot; come from the sofa &quot; and &quot; to be active every day &quot; hit deaf ears because many public messages to health are boring and come from people who look miserable .
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated .
those who regularly exercise sport reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical exercise helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead you here .
but the wonder@@ full thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
three pillars of health are thus covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even close new friend@@ ships during the hunt .
as always , there are also deadly game spo@@ ils , which always have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could walk around a door .
what should I do ?
a breakthrough happened .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit were able to track our activity earlier , they did not give us a reason to do sport as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will be decreasing over time .
because of Poker &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier .

and now finally Olympic Champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast went to the championship title on Thursday and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her overall score of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly in front of the silver med@@ alists and &quot; Final Five &quot; team amer@@ ican A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alli@@ sts Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the American Women &apos;s Sim@@ one Bil@@ es tur@@ ises on the stead@@ fast@@ ness of the women in the summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bil@@ let is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who wins a multi @-@ competition title and the fifth , while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation , or even at all .
she burst into tears as her end result was shown and her long journey at that moment ended .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es won the last three years of her sport , 15 world championship med@@ als , including 10 gold med@@ als , including 10 gold med@@ als , including 10 gold med@@ als , including a mix of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u rescu@@ on told her that she is &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it awaited her last examination in Brazil , a competition which did not go so much between the balance and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be regarded as disappointment .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in each of the women &apos;s workshops at the 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
she took the first medal on Tuesday , as she served as an ex@@ clamation mark on the farewell party of the team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although she insi@@ sted on having never planned the future during her long journey , this is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - including their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gym@@ nasi@@ um in which Bo@@ or@@ man trained , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , it hasn &apos;t lost any additional competition , a series of victories that will last as long as it wishes .
even though Mu@@ staf@@ ina was slightly led by two turns , the picture sh@@ ook .
Swe@@ e@@ beam and ground gymnas@@ tics - in which Bal@@ es holds the world title - lou@@ dly .
she recovered again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam - and sat on the floor with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently as she waited for her clos@@ eness - a pure form@@ ality - and tears poured into fine shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book became a reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was revenge for the last time four years ago when it fought for third place , but the bronze medal in a ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Mu@@ staf@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , who is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Grand@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the Americans , had a lead . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her floor exercise , she threw the audience to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed doub@@ t@@ ful .
as for Bil@@ i , the rapidly expanding we@@ et of 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims were shot in the car in serial kill@@ ings
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl killed in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix while they stopped in the car and heard music .
Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stef@@ an@@ ie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis subsidiary Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand @-@ fire weapon while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police informed that the triple murder does not seem to have been the result of rob@@ ber@@ y , since the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who owned one of the adult victims .
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting had led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they were connected with four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in nine attacks within four months , and two more were injured in nine attacks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Howard of K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ an from the late 199@@ 0@@ ies , a black BMW from the late 199@@ 0@@ ies and a white Ca@@ dil@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which was carried out on an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge shells and secured a ball out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 year old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the least of his elderly , Ed@@ mund &apos;s micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy .
when he first came home , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t do that .
I don &apos;t create that .
I didn &apos;t let go of that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is not true at all -- of course , you have embark@@ ed on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband , Vincent and you have been told that , under certain circumstances , Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize them and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not know that people still do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l until his third year of life and he still cannot speak .
but he is progres@@ sing slowly .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund asked for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing something before &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring him sign language , &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented a few characters on her own .
micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Zi@@ k@@ virus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the Zi@@ k@@ virus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I asked constantly what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t really know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I didn &apos;t expect them to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful suggestion for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ virus .
it gets better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
violent ra@@ ins , floods cause ba@@ il@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ all and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call the emergency stand on Friday . it is expected to be more rainf@@ all throughout the day .
numerous rivers in southeast Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flooded their banks and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service .
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards informed that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the move to help the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that alone the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ ua had requested ten thousand sand bags .
a flood warning system is used over wide parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana until Saturday .
the weather service announced that there could be additional 3 to 5 inches of rain in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood warning system was deployed on Friday as it continued to rain in the Mobile area .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will probably reach record levels over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a downstream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these flows only slowly over the assigned rivers into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w River , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , arrived on Friday at 09.@@ 00 the highest level ever recorded .
rescue teams still plu@@ cked people out of flood water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the south @-@ west of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were rescu@@ ed from Glo@@ ster on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water of Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , increased overnight .
he said that another step @-@ son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water was flowing and f@@ lowed in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife said to Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all the disabilities and he was the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ fer had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ver , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spread quickly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities were considering ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer reported in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the rain has been completely absorbed by the rainf@@ all since Wednesday .
the authorities indicated that heavy rainf@@ alls and floo@@ ding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and the loss of instruction in five bor@@ ou@@ ghs .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a co @-@ ordin@@ ate in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa took over 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches , now both flooded .
the chairman of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had rescu@@ ed 72 people and seven pets that were r@@ ins@@ ed by the floods .
in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the ev@@ acu@@ ees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the water starts to go back , they will be able to return to their homes again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond , the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of roads were closed because of the flood , and sand bags were provided for the residents to take part , hoping to keep the water out of their homes and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last major flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his statements , a handful of houses on Thursday will have been reported as flooded , but on Friday , no reports have been reported so far .
Keith T@@ own@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I have seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; T@@ own@@ son said , &quot; and it &apos;s still coming . &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; bul@@ ked by bul@@ lets , &quot; survived sho@@ ot@@ ings in Philadelphia
the police informs that the six @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time that a 6 year old child was shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several shot injuries including in the loin , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was aware of his transport to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his little body was bul@@ lied by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe that .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered to be critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the station that he is expected to recover .
he should have started the first class at a local primary school .
brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical condition , shot up , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police determined whether one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ator .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seemed to be a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
cartridge shells for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were traced back to different assault ri@@ fl@@ es , attacked the crime scene .
it seems that this is clearly an ongoing struggle .
on the street , on both sides of the walk@@ way , were filled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it seems that there were several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police department Anthony G@@ inal@@ di from the police station in Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
several houses and vehicles were also found in the area .
there was no arrest and the police are re@@ port@@ edly checking the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a squee@@ ze on her arm , when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .
she re@@ covers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that &apos;s what I set up at the women &apos;s Olympic team in the Tur@@ ns and that for more than one reason .
first of all , I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA have never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three gym@@ na@@ sts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who were inspiring for many young girls of other skin colors .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Catho@@ lics , rounds off , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the United States .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and his@@ panic @-@ female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one among female gym@@ na@@ sts was an Af@@ ro @-@ American .
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America acclaimed .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world champion Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they provided unexpected but master@@ ful gym@@ n@@ astic routines .
on Thursday Sim@@ one was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won gold at an individual competition event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but we do not see gym@@ n@@ astic classes all over the country .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all hit the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to make it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four female gym@@ na@@ sts in the team . besides , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that gymnas@@ tics is an expensive sport and Tur@@ ner is primarily in private sports clubs that are maintained by parents who pay for training , training , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gym@@ n@@ ens and families ) . the list can be continued as you like .
the majority of these trainers are in prosper@@ ous suburbs to support business .
in these clubs the gym@@ na@@ sts get their entire training and that is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained their athletes since they started with the gymnas@@ tics .
we have to give the churches a countless , young girls who are inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ use gym@@ n@@ astic .
I founded my sports foundation for 20 years .
in my events we offered free and affordable gym@@ n@@ astic in Harlem for over 15,000 urban te@@ ens ( especially black and his@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gym@@ n@@ astic , which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymnas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration for this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in gymnas@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &apos; Girl Power &apos; by the Hol@@ en of the Olympic clu@@ b@@ team and thank you for letting so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistance specialists want to organise further strikes after ref@@ using Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 resident doctors voted in favour of a vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in July Hun@@ t had unveiled plans to forci@@ bly launch the contract and said that the N@@ HS was in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No Man &apos;s Country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and would be harmful to the staff and patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first assistance specialists are expected to receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend supplements to improve care for non @-@ monthly periods .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the president of the BM@@ A committee on assistance doctors said last night in a message with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assistance specialists have serious concerns about the proposed contract , especially that it will heat up the current occupation crisis and it will be able to treat all doctors &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out .
efforts by the BM@@ A to resolve disputes by talks clas@@ h@@ ed with the government on the contrary , and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this was a promise made by Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now to lift up the vibration and address the concerns of the assistance specialists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do so , the assistance specialists have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further working conditions .
the last strike at the end of April saw a boost of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to provide doctors on the stri@@ k@@ po@@ ste chain .
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by accepting the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BM@@ A wants a better weekend pay for the 5@@ 4,000 assistants who are subject to the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS employees , called on the assistance specialists to termin@@ ate the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ timer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; working combat measures do not achieve anything but burdens already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare only concerns , need and inter@@ ruption for patients , nur@@ ses and their families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the past two months , we have spoken to the committee of assistance specialists and responded positively to the concerns about guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries .
the employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as sending , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , continuing education and gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it were employers who were Health Education UK and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the BM@@ A agreements in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per Tag@@ - drug that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attacks patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication after being advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulating medicine T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the drug is administered for 12 months following a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attacks .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
some 140@@ ,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year , and one quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form floor@@ ings .
if the surface breaks apart , it may cause a blood cl@@ ots that c@@ logged the blood flow to the heart and thereby cause a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots dis@@ sol@@ ves , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the flow of blood to the brain , causing a stroke .
individuals who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely .
the introduc@@ tory design by N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing other heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack .
due to a preliminary recommendation by T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from this .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - above all the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness Le@@ aves electoral fraud in Muslim regions
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed from office last year due to the dis@@ miss@@ al of a government report
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities know@@ ingly ignored , like a devastating government report today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally attacks the police , election observers and town councils to have ignored proof of electoral abuse due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former minister of integration and local government , who is now an anti @-@ corruption manoeu@@ vre , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off shut @-@ off tapes outside of electoral cabins to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
he recommends that voters should take a card to prove their identity in elections .
at present , a vot@@ er has to name only his name and address .
the report proposes removing non @-@ removable ink on a person &apos;s finger when they hand off their voting voice to prevent someone from choosing twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
he demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions by non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only for election fraud , but also to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial investment culture that goes with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was ordered by Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election sk@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year , a special court ruled that the acting mayor of Lut@@ on should be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cy@@ ni@@ cally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that he would silence his critics with eu@@ gen@@ ics and Islam@@ opho@@ bic charges . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 votes were doub@@ t@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation in which a person was chosen as someone else .
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country .
in particular , he vo@@ iced alarm on the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter of letters - when senior members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , m@@ apped , made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system , including conducting alignment to prove the identity
in his report it says : &quot; as proof , pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exer@@ ted , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the older , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there have been concerns that ... state institutions have know@@ ingly ignored such behavior because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sensi@@ tivities of eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including the prohibition that political activists handle mail selection documents to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ aping the election &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and social fraud .
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone choosing twice .
to conduct systematic reviews of the nationality of a person in order to ensure that they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications to an automatic letter selection .
prohibition that political activists handle complete letters and envel@@ opes of let@@ ter@@ backs .
the police have authority to establish barriers to electoral stations .
a law amend@@ ment facilit@@ ated an indictment for in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( 1983 ) .
prohibition of photograph@@ ing in electoral stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the poll@@ ing stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fying the training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go to the bal@@ lot alone .
Sir Eric notices the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case there was no criminal complaint .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ele@@ ction Court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ suitable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was found guilty on the basis of a number of reasons - according to the high demands in the criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ eff@@ ec@@ tual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check@@ points &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the election registration departments of the town hall . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our country is a proud legacy as the Mother of Par@@ liam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation .
crazy about Kate &apos;s cycling bi@@ ker and other famous doubles from Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio are out of the br@@ ink this week by the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , who has proven to be an impressive double @-@ player of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic Champion is by far not the only athlete competing for gold , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not if you are allowed to believe the social media .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ ck@@ ering at the time on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic games that have more than a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the hunter and the wolf : crew member of the US squ@@ ad in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , has been compared to Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood
besides K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ gers on the racing track , many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be .
the team member of the US team in Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street star sc@@ ary similar .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself do not see a great resem@@ b@@ lance , except the facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good looking guy , so I &apos;m doing it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the all@@ uring simil@@ arity between Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gym@@ n@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina with her big expressive eyes shall be able to go through the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared to G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ c@@ eption Stran@@ ger &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another prolonged comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal s@@ wimm@@ in Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mo@@ v shows more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American was att@@ ested by fans to resemble an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face form and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy about the fact that others have noticed the simil@@ arities .
theory in space : according to this user , there might be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user told her satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks Hope solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and D@@ ex@@ ter &apos;s act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an unbeliev@@ ably similar visual form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons included Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ ning Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own beautiful , wide smile , similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .

the Canadian broad@@ caster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese swi@@ mmer &quot; like low went off &quot; and during the race as &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought his microphone was off , when at the end of the 4x@@ 200@@ s fre@@ estyle swimming staff@@ el he had to hand off his own opinions .
Mac@@ Donald , who had been brought on board in the commentary team of the C@@ BS in order to give more &quot; color , &quot; could be heard : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in lost the connection , baby . &quot;

the Chinese float in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , swa@@ m the second stage of the relay race 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled the Canadian to close the gap in China .
viewers throughout Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were shocked by the sound and the language .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Di@@ d the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a pig died &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? ? ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot has not broken that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai Yan@@ han , China , was described as follows : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in lost the connection , Baby . &quot;
the criticism against By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter came fast and hard , in which many were talking about him
Twitter users did not stay back when they heard how un@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let us all look like ra@@ cists . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a short time later , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC programme , ap@@ ologi@@ zed live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment being broadcast on a floating performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate choice , sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the end of more than 90 times with the people who responded to the B@@ emer@@ kt about Twitter
the comment@@ ator colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze on behalf of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about the comments of Mac@@ Donald
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
yesterday night we ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly to our audience on show and our follow @-@ up in the social media .
to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the float and not on it as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate choice . By@@ ron is very sorry about what he said .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald agreed in the show and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to excuse me for the comment that I made after the women &apos;s swimming relay in the C@@ BC Olympic circuit , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have referred to the performance of the float and not on it as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged by woman who sham@@ elessly ass@@ esses under@@ wear in the midst of business
the buyers did not know where to go , when a woman pulled out her clothes in the midst of a Pri@@ mark to try out under@@ pants .
in order to wor@@ sen the situation , she scrut@@ ini@@ zed her , as she looked at it , pulled it off and put it back into the shelf .
she moved on and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark Store at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried the under@@ pants before putting her back on the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in the business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , she went back and went out of business without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales floor , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled out her own ti@@ ghts and trousers and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like Osk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone gaz@@ ed when she pulled out the pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put them back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three more under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , put herself back and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it did not seem to distur@@ b someone to observe - or think about the person who under circumstances would buy the under@@ pants that she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to think that someone would take shelter with home that had another person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I got along , the employees tried to withdraw the clothes from the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and went out and she didn &apos;t wash her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products in question were drawn from the sale .
how to protect oneself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a against weapons attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
we talked to Rh@@ one Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Union in New York , to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at a distance .
regardless of whether you are approaching you from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn around the sk@@ ewer for your rob@@ ber .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you get closer to you from behind you should turn around as first , so that you can see your aggres@@ sor and move &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of the shot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
then beat him with his knee in the bar and twist , while the attack@@ er is bent in front of pain , the weapon from his hands . hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the gun on him .
for attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the gun and twist it so that the aggres@@ sor cannot shoot .
at the same time , shift the weight on the weapon and hit the attack@@ er on the chest , then turn the gun out of its grip before moving backwards and direct the weapon to it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi is doing .
but remember that at a rob@@ ber@@ y it is the saf@@ est thing to hand over your money - unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
travel@@ er Ian W@@ right ch@@ ab@@ ts his tongue to the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British travel@@ er under@@ took his immune system and pro@@ strate of a serious test by le@@ aking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting locations in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k sh@@ ook his course on a euro note , a ban@@ ister at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a flush button of a train toilet , as well as a public phone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before landing any object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and to show us what he is going to get involved in .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results .
the thought of le@@ aking the flush button of a train toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately , nothing left behind him , more than a bad after@@ taste in his mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his bow@@ els by travelling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things .
from public bal@@ u@@ stra@@ des to railway stations to r@@ ins@@ ing but@@ ton@@ gs of toilets , the task was defini@@ tively tested by his immune system
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film , he justified his reputation in any case .
the only thing he rejected was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his sample line showed a lumin@@ omet@@ ry number of more than 4000 units .
in comparison to this , the lumin@@ omet@@ ry number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to lick after her lumin@@ ova figure was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have less than 60
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that comes close to the worst thing I got into a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing worse than that !
I won &apos;t lick anything here because it is disgu@@ sting inside .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vali@@ os Senior Venice president for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating for watching and at the same time explaining the benefits of pro@@ biotics .
we conducted mad bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended up saying that we said &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put it in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he checked some of the things I told him to lick , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet shown in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick her and others where this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents reported lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of the stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products containing enclosed lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ cial family destroyed before Del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation Social council in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left her apartment after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation with a loss of £ 50,000 because she had terr@@ orized her neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after being forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls had pla@@ sty holes , wooden plan@@ ks were torn , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was s@@ me@@ ared to the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accomodation .
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider , as this property is thought to be considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted on street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dations by residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive scre@@ aming , stri@@ kers and floods .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , was given an order for anti @-@ social behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
the property in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past were pil@@ ed up
neighbors testi@@ fied that they saw her fighting on the street and had to be called up on a regular basis the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing annex@@ ed her and her partner this week forci@@ bly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw .
the del@@ o@@ cul@@ ation was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbors who said that their life was made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They were not afraid of anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived beside them for 20 years and it was always bad .
the countless times we put the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this morning we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now that they are finally gone , it will be beautiful .
farmer Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , testi@@ fied that the family had to be ab@@ used with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals , for 20 years
on the out@@ stretched side of the village house waste and old toys were thrown down
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant has arranged to accept any responsibility for her behaviour and family as a del@@ o@@ cul@@ ation is always the last step that considers Corn@@ wall housing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their deeds had to be horrible for their neighbors .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have provided us with the information .
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message con@@ veys that anti @-@ social behavior will not be tolerated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ cking on the floor
workers of the house administration will now have to clean up garbage mountains that surround the house
in 2014 , the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine after having found himself guilty of own@@ ing a class B drug in merchant &apos;s view .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
after being homeless , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many room walls of the house were decorated with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say they will deleg@@ ate rent@@ ers who do not stick to the house rules
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall told Angela C@@ row that del@@ o@@ cking was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not stick to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can act without self @-@ repro@@ ach and to those who have been har@@ med by such a behavior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

the air forces indicated that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that no safety risk was present
this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after an eff@@ ig@@ ent jet crashed through a full beach .
dramatic video sho@@ ot@@ ings showed how the military plane was almost close to the sun worshi@@ ppers on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers jumped up when they understand@@ ably began to worry about the noise of the D@@ üs@@ s@@ rieb@@ werke , without seeing what came to them through the clouds .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many holi@@ day@@ makers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew twice really deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists on the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep
the Portuguese air forces announced today that the Pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and so had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the spokes@@ man said that the jet flew lower than usual due to the poor visibility due to poor visibility , but the air forces insi@@ sted that security at no time was at risk .
area fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where also four people on Madeira Island came to death .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that due to the conditions - heavy fog and smoke , the pilot had to fly so deeply , which limits his view .
the plane was on a training flight , where the pilot needed to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise .

Ma Long in his own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow country@@ man and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ k 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4 ) .
the World Cup first took the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and just Olympia .
bronze passed to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ zu@@ ani .
the two Chinese managed to get into the final game as expected and made the title among themselves .
so it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top of the Olympia podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sentences and in time @-@ outs , they had no coaches with them .
they had withdrawn from the tri@@ b@@ une and left their prot@@ é@@ g@@ és on top of each other in a fair competition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have played the matches until here for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang had said logical . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game gold and silver med@@ alists posed with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expectedly one @-@ sided .
Ma had really to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first set .
then he set the pace on the plate and left Z@@ hang from there only a total of 13 points .
due to the superi@@ ority of Ma , not the expected ro@@ using match did not develop .
nevertheless , there were nevertheless enough breathtaking ball changes to be seen .
Mi@@ ć@@ ani won the game for Bronze on the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quarter @-@ final against the German European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the White @-@ Russian bred a rib@@ bed injury , and after that he had to settle in sheet metal .
by the way , the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) became Olympic @-@ Fourth in similarly high table tennis .
Donald Tr@@ ump conce@@ des &quot; huge problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the US re@@ public@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive worries , even in traditionally conservative states .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump gave up the weakness of his election campaign in the so @-@ called Republi@@ can strongh@@ old of U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confi@@ dently occurring mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ ary expressed something like concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported .
having thrown 16 ri@@ vals inside his own Republi@@ can camp from the race , doubts continue to grow in the battle for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump from Evangel@@ icals which he asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to blame are false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his famous media scene .
repub@@ li@@ can strongh@@ olds go shaking
U@@ tah is usually a safe bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
according to a survey conducted by Surv@@ ey@@ USA in June , Tr@@ ump and his rival from the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , were also at the same time .
other institutions see Tr@@ ump at the front , but not by the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered .
in an interview with the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump answered the question of how to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and afterwards : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either be successful or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does nothing else than telling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it does not suff@@ ice for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , that is fine , Tr@@ ump said .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party is said to have threatened to cancel funds to support its electoral campaign , it should not be able to present better survey results .
instead of that , the Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans want to strengthen their ranks among the poor .
Olympia : three @-@ part fraud on dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary committee .
Kenya &apos;s athletes face the second dop@@ ing affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
after a dec@@ ep@@ tive attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya has sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee decided to immediately set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case .
an Ken@@ yan function told that the former S@@ printer and present coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , had given a urine sample under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich in the Olympic Village .
this was reported to the team leader K@@ eni@@ as by the dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF World Association has searched the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to ex@@ ert its own investigations , an IA@@ AF spokes@@ man announced .
&quot; depending on the results of the study and the measures taken by the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; she said in an IA@@ AF explanation .
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and presented himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , handed out the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; explained K@@ eni@@ as Head de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete , who was on the list of training controls of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was over 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan Track &amp; Field leader Michael Rot@@ ich was stri@@ pped off by the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed athletes of his country about pending dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he was said to have been arrested at his return at Nairobi &apos;s airport .
Kenya has been under special observation at the IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing violations for some time now .
in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by the IO@@ C prior to the Rio games , it was previously indicated that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil , creating an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the beginning of the Olympics .
as a consequence , the WA@@ DA Kenya took from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing fight conform to the rules of the WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a great runner nation .
the athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a series of television reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations have been raised again and again that dop@@ ing agents are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a significant mentality of sports fraud . &quot; &quot; &quot;
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und finally called for a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had employed in Russian athle@@ tics .
in doing so , it has been proven that in this sport @-@ type area @-@ overl@@ apping and systematically re@@ activated .
as a result , Russia &apos;s athletes were excluded from the summer games .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Shakespeare year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with it a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins masterpiece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the artistic director , Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled herself with the role of Maria a youth room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchester directed by the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he enth@@ uses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have amber music in our blood !
in this production Bart@@ oli plays an older Mary .
she re@@ members melanch@@ oly at her love with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
first of all , because it &apos;s unusual musi@@ cally !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so she is wise , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very similar to me , my Italian character I have as a Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &#91; laughs &#93; Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is a tremend@@ ously generous person .
and Bart@@ oli res@@ umes the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
one sees it in each of his movements , in his glan@@ ces , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a happy approach to life , that is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans went to New York , and the New Yor@@ kers didn &apos;t want them .
these are the same topics , and they are as significant today as they were then .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London school girl , who joined the IS , was killed in Syria
Ka@@ di@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school girls who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that her family learned about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria a few weeks ago .
it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , I@@ TV News reported on Thursday .
Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she pre@@ tended to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only hope that the only good thing is - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks connected with going to a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other school girls from the east of London boar@@ ded an airplane in the direction of Turkey , followed by a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tana &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months .

Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ lands confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the dec@@ eased judge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to choose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain degree of certainty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Clinton . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he had not talked to Clinton whether she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulate .
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about un@@ rest with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Court for the U.S. Court of Appe@@ als for the District of Columbia .
RAID said Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the Gar@@ lands nomin@@ ee , be lack@@ eys and rescu@@ ers of Republi@@ can presidential candidates Donald Tr@@ ump .
he also stated that Donald Tr@@ ump is un@@ suitable for the Pres@@ i@@ dency of the Pres@@ i@@ dency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tre@@ ats wants to be a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women and men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazine works with photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere to publish a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of Top@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of this year , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us that his nude magazine of Old@@ school play@@ boys is different , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently , it is the opinion that the calendar is doing well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must return to the representation of timeless and classical nu@@ dity where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release to release the calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally at open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community expects mass cur@@ ses
&quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t suit and Erdo@@ gan pra@@ ises is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
in the short term , the Kurdish community of Germany expects tens of thousands of asylum seekers who fled from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the chairman of the association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the hard drive of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands of refugees from Turkey in the medium term , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues fighting the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government has already over@@ taken Kurdish strongh@@ olds with criminal law several months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds are on the run within Turkey .
according to the pla@@ gu@@ ed put@@ sch , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks would be added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to start anew in Europe if they are further oppressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that receives refugees , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Association compla@@ ined about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities .
this will allow Erdo@@ gan to increase the exit pressure to the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradic@@ ated or displaced in the last hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a member of the CD@@ U . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the President of the Association called for the federal government to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in Germany a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics is taking place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the past few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the Brand@@ marking as a Gü@@ len @-@ Pend@@ ant destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever doesn &apos;t suit and Erdo@@ gan pra@@ ises , sits on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alist and secular , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the newspaper reports by calling on figures from the Federal Ministry of Interior , the Turks had already presented the largest group of asylum @-@ holders recognized for political persecution in Germany before the coup .
as of June 30 , this was 11.@@ 3@@ 86 people , nearly 29 per cent of all recognised as eligible for asylum ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , there is no need for war , poverty or lack of prospects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asylum rights according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the natives receive nothing from the summer election campaign - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia shall not vote for the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
in 2021 , the country &apos;s election will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
after all , it &apos;s not stupid as yet : summer holidays , heat and land@@ day bal@@ m struggle - that bites .
the locals , who are supposed to be convinced by the election champi@@ ons , are on holiday .
most of the holi@@ day@@ makers who are in the country , on the way to U@@ se@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so do not choose the land day .
practical problems come here : during the holidays hel@@ pers who hang posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and end up votes will only work hard .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election day and the last day of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign close to the people .
the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys .
it will be exciting , how strong newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition agreement .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost in@@ conspic@@ uous electoral campaign , one sees from his big posters .
he travels through the country , distri@@ butes roses and chat@@ ting a little with the people , just as his legendary elo@@ qu@@ ent predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff did .
apart from that , se@@ ering has received cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the flour@@ ishing of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accelerated the rise of right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its peak channel data , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced what it is like to make election campaign at the wrong time at the wrong time .
she has invited Angela Merkel twice as Chancellor Angela Merkel to make her big news ; the German Chancellor Angela Merkel is located in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Western Pom@@ er@@ ania .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
apart from that , the Nor@@ theast @-@ CD@@ U largely wai@@ ves the usual campaign conditions on market@@ places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union has also noticed that in the country , it is clear that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any available in the expan@@ se of the country .
the Council of the CD@@ U campaig@@ ner Kok@@ ert to his fellow campaig@@ ners is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; you must go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : village festivals , golden weddings , every birthday party has to be used . &quot;
because there is a lot on the game , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD into a particularly committed election campaign .
in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats lay at least 22 percent behind the CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the election of 2011 , the SPD won still clearly with 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , should make the leap into the country day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of holiday necessity and largely transfer their campaign to the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online campaign , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the president Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , green election campaig@@ ners embar@@ k on a search for local vocal ch@@ ords among holi@@ day@@ makers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , just cur@@ v@@ ades with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it also beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is no punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Ren@@ ov@@ ation : restaurants suffer from blocking
at the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated , there is nothing to complain about .
for those responsible for the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30@@ am in the morning and only end at 8 pm , praise is everywhere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they &apos;ve done everything pretty fli@@ ck@@ ering , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the Jet petrol station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no default .
the construction site was scheduled to be moved to the south at the beginning of the week , and everything will be ready by the end of October .
the award is also commen@@ ded to those responsible for the construction work , such as when it comes to furnishing of emergency drives .
since the construction site was moved to the south on Monday and also the lock of the asphalt road in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and so the connection to Rot@@ tenburg has been restored , the traffic situation within the village has relaxed .
the citizens can now move from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen to the B 27 on both sides .
the passing through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there have been some considerable complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said deputy prime minister , Florian King , responsible for the transport management of the rehabilitation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ strasse , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many Sch@@ leich@@ straße sought and preferred their Nav@@ i as the sig@@ nage .
what led to the fact that some trucks were fran@@ tically sealed in residential areas .
as the speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the municipality called for the exhibition vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; there were considerable over@@ rides , &quot; says King , who himself made himself informed about the situation himself .
two to three per minute have already been heated .
the fastest was on the way with 77 hour kilometers in the pace @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has been moved , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg the road is now open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 rehabilitation has led to revenue bro@@ o@@ ks allows everyone to look through .
however , some are more and less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. produced for other companies , have hardly any consequences for them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only slight decline &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also acknow@@ le@@ dges that , of course , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the search for running is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most hit are the bars along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential threat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit hard &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing .
we must be glad about every euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sales revenue is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far above 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road refurb@@ ishment took its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back two years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
half of his staff have had to release him .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , President of the government has given Jörg Schmidt on a request by G@@ öh@@ ner whether there could be a financial compensation , with the advice that the restaurant profit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 . now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where it was handled more gener@@ ously .
with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , and refers to the long history .
he can understand that other regul@@ ars are seeing less frequently because of complicated traffic management .
if you can &apos;t go down , it is also somewhere else beautiful .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts that his pedi@@ gree will come back after the refurb@@ ishment work has ended .
in spite of the crises with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on his clientele for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , this is already brutal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is constantly being scre@@ wed on laws in the name of the fight against terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is now propos@@ ing a thick security package .
but what has a d@@ ul@@ ment status to do with terror ?
and what does the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the ser@@ ge@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically acceptable to the coalition partner &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Federal Minister for Interior Affairs at the launch of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they do not overwhel@@ m anyone .
other further points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also took part in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as Minister of the Interior he was on results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had a little time to pass before he presented his conclusions for security in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
a lot has already been announced , announced , announced : that a new security authority to take care of encrypted communication is not new .
nor is the fact that Germany has to implement several EU targets on air passenger data and weapons law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère starts a second attempt for proposals that have not been made with the SPD so far : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under punishment and kno@@ ck jihadi@@ sts on the German passport with double nationality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad@@ mits the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he still considers it reasonable and doesn &apos;t demand anything that doesn &apos;t have any chances for the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner anyway .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère presents a few new ideas .
they have partly in themselves : he plans rapid procedures for deport@@ ations and more opportunities for det@@ ain@@ ing people from deportation .
refugees who are being targeted in the country should check their smartphones in advance and expose social media accounts for a security check .
in case of divor@@ ces for rejected asylum seekers , he still wants to make some worse than previously - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately disc@@ ard their documents in order to conc@@ eal their identity .
some of it is politically and legally prec@@ arious .
some people are still un@@ educated and leave questions un@@ answered .
and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient for example - the question arises : what does it really have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the themes of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be argued that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
in addition , many people worried about security in the face of the high number of refugees .
and things that pro@@ found@@ ly employed people could not be cl@@ inging to election times either .
the inner security has been put into focus .
first the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are elections .
on the subject of internal security , Union and SPD are therefore increasingly in position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past few days , between the two parties we went high . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a gar@@ sti@@ er argument about the features of the Federal Police , then a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the department heads also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from the dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also struggling here for irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able sounds .
from a return from the double pass , he doesn &apos;t hold anything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have satisfied the discussion in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to re@@ plen@@ ish it is not expe@@ dient .
and in case of a bur@@ ka ban , he has constitutional obj@@ ections .
whether its own package is constitutional in all corners and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner , must first show itself .
there is a lot of things that could help fight .
but the SPD is also trying to profile itself on the subject of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further improve security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , Volkswagen got off lightly .
in spite of diesel prices , delivery volumes are increasing worldwide .
but not all markets are running smoothly .
there is confusion around a term in the recall action .
Volkswagen starts cau@@ ti@@ ously in shipments to the second half of the year .
despite the diesel aff@@ aires , Europe &apos;s biggest car manufacturer can continue to show a plus in spite of the diesel prices , thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July , Volkswagen &apos;s core brand was weak@@ ening mainly in Western Europe and thereby adver@@ sely affected the total sales , as the company quoted in the Da@@ x .
in July , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , China was the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s level .
in the home market of Germany the deliveries fell by almost a sixth .
Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann , head of sales , led the weaker figures from July , especially at two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there has been a reluct@@ ance to buy back in some core markets due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on the exit from the EU also stressed that a spokes@@ woman explained .
in the United States , where the exhaust gases first escal@@ ated , a minus is also available .
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the primarily affected house brand of the Lower Saxony was further off lightly by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months only a delivery minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available .
group sales director Fred Kap@@ pler was able to advance a sales increase from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5,@@ 90@@ 4 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated emission tests with a software .
in Germany alone , VW is calling around 2.5 million vehicles for retro@@ fitting into the workshops .
in the course of the retro@@ fitting VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects .
after the conversion of the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the change@@ over , the car manufacturer establishes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed certificate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , but I do not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was called on Friday in company circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason for this is j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal intri@@ c@@ acies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now provided its German customers with a guarantee of sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday .
the Ministry of Transport confirms that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW must fully comply with the requirements of my enquiry commission and KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; devi@@ ations from these will not be accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has assumed the guarantee that in the case of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine output after conversion no deterioration will take place and all type approved vehicle values remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen self uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was said in company circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example , for half a year after conversion , customers can come to a workshop for example with engine damage - and this could lead back to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
also in the interests of the customer , it is important to avoid that any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust sc@@ andal may result in uncertainty about possible warranty regulations , as it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund on Lake T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands a number of wealthy savers in the future - as second Institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; boss Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are only 139 customers who park 40 million euros in sight deposit accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Federal Association of German banks speaks of an individual case and does not see a signal in it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savers have to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not fear to pay for their harsh pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if banks spend money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent penalty interest .
this fee demands the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros in bank or daily cash accounts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first 100.000 euro are free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 cost will cost 400 euros in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for some time now , he covered 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day to the next and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chief of the Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lay down for every million Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter pays principle , the costs now continue .
leaving the cash in the saf@@ es of Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank would be much too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four ra@@ ids , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! &quot; said the Chief Financial Officer .
most customers would have understood and changed to other forms of investment .
few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Co@@ operative State of Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs for all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to carry you alone is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically un@@ sustainable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks therefore have increased their account management fees , credit cards or transfers .
the Thurin@@ gian folk and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land , with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 , made head@@ lines with penalty interest for deposits from € 3 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , CEO of the banking union said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide fees for deposits , the competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clientele that is somewhat luxuri@@ ously equipped by the property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if they keep money free of charge . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; there are currently no other banks known to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ operatives Union of Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which charge a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said speaker Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the president of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banken and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ banken ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threshold to go into neg@@ atives is very , very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
competition is tough , and it is threatening the emig@@ ration of investors to competition .
customers in Germany will not be pleased with this in terms of width .
Dest@@ ination records : who actually bu@@ ys vinyl records ?
lonely men middle @-@ aged people love plates .
before you go to the comment section , to cut it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym Non @-@ Alle@@ vi@@ ation men &apos;s middle @-@ aged with harsh insul@@ ts , this statement deri@@ ves from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the re @-@ emergence of records is not attributable to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to mid @-@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght at the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
it is also not a hormone by hobby collectors - it has an emotional impact : older record buyers tend to retain their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog was a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the midst of a busy street in Soh@@ o , wearing a modest gray suit and wild@@ ly dressed , before I stop , hold my hands and say something men@@ ac@@ ing like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent sal@@ es@@ men were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops .
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to turn off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , which I received from Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of data : eight middle @-@ aged men , a woman , presumably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I guess , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have approx . 3,000 or 4,000 s@@ labs .
these records , pictured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and bought again items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things in which I was probably a bit too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agrees that those who buy records are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend time alone , and add : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink much .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers who meet him apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are forced to buy their old records again .
from the talks I have conducted , people usually get rid of their collection by 1998 or 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of plates ?
it only takes a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offer a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers joined the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of trusted record covers , from items that aw@@ aken happy youth memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possessing material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is my collector and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to mentally employ yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inspir@@ es a worker from a plate stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not listened to them yet .
the survey also found that 41 % possessed a record player they never used , while 7 % of those who buy a record don &apos;t own a record player .
at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried as I scroll through a pile of Bos@@ sa nov@@ a comp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) has noticed a &quot; trop@@ hi@@ es aspect &quot; of the revival .
&quot; someone came here just recently and said , &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead LP , so that I can put it on the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more product @-@ laden , less musi@@ cally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones who come in slowly .
F@@ op@@ p , which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records , has a b@@ lower audience when I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and middle @-@ aged women .
even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned stores - Wild Be@@ asts of latest syn@@ th@@ esi@@ ze and sex@@ - packed pop instead of experimental jazz from the speakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks very lonely , but psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard to determine if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the store for a few minutes and considers the variety of records to be sold .
it makes a window @-@ stroll rather than a big shopping .
she doesn &apos;t deserve much , so collecting records is not a real option , she says .
it costs much .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; she is driving with a loving si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of fans : urban ou@@ fit@@ ters .
while I am preten@@ ding to smu@@ ggle the jeans pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who are group@@ ing themselves around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Cros@@ ley turn@@ table .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these items will mean more money for the industry and some customers could send into the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates .
even though my research has shown that the results of You@@ Go@@ v are correct , they are un@@ accounted for , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record stores and online forums .
these people work hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday mor@@ nings with security not stro@@ lling through record shops of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates as they avoid the star@@ ing look of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false present@@ er who raises no middle @-@ aged men &apos;s shoulders .

French Court re@@ jects an offer on demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live .
during a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary transactions where individuals within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell , provide hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and that a fire and san@@ ity risk .
humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also stated that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who run the 72 temporary business , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were &quot; absolutely track@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely feeding people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places threatened by the tear@@ ing was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is usually operated and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0.000 people signed the petition to keep the kids &apos; café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe by which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of people in the jungle camp was increased to over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number so far - after a steep increase of newcom@@ ers in the course of summer .
despite Olympia @-@ disappointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant
despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing performance in the Olympic timer , Rad@@ prof@@ i Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to be defeated .
&quot; I keep looking at the World Cup , stay confident and fight further , &quot; said the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook .
he did not have an explanation for his miserable twel@@ fth place at the Su@@ ck@@ erh@@ ut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honestly find it difficult to comment on the time driving yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must calm@@ ly analyse the reasons for the de@@ bac@@ le .
at the time of the World Championship in October in Qatar , Martin wanted to fight for the title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will take a close look at everything we have changed over the past few years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this also counts my position , &quot; wrote the three @-@ time World Champion World Champion , who had lost 5 minutes more than three minutes to Olympic champion Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) on Wednesday .

here comes the forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation speed@@ ometer : in different federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , which are to be presented effectively .
the futur@@ istic reinforcement of Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used , for example , at accident focuses , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , there is often no necessary infrastructure for motorway construction sites or to renov@@ ating bridges with a temporary speed limit to ensure compliance with speed limits .
but a permanent mobile setup can be too dangerous or complex .
the forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : in case of continuous measurement , its battery lasts for five days , the trap data is transmitted encrypted over a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be recorded across multiple tracks at the same time .
variable speed limits and drive @-@ through b@@ ans after time , road strips and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the highly driven state , the trailer can be moved according to the manufacturer with each car with tow hit@@ ch .
so that it is not simply stolen , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and inci@@ dentally also sho@@ ck@@ proof outer hull van@@ ish .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested by Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .
foreign authorities also flash@@ ed with the new technology : recently France ordered 100 pieces , following an order of 150 pieces last year .
Britain fet@@ ches silver in 7 @-@ star ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold
the impressive achievement of Great Britain at 7 @-@ 7 Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt in the final hur@@ dle in the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they hit the de@@ odor@@ o stage here in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 .
Fi@@ ji shared a master class in handling , side st@@ eppe , back , line run and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color .
the defeat was lost due to the not too bad con@@ sol@@ ation price of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day , could fall back on them in the final .
but independently of this Fi@@ ji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man @-@ team in top form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least one Brit@@ on tomorrow will have a gold medal to hang around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , former head of England in Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago , R@@ yan lost any game at Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they only lost one .
this s@@ lag will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji mysteri@@ ously began to boun@@ ce G@@ Bs from fun .
it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. to run into driving buses . the World Series Win@@ ner went up 5 @-@ 0 up when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au moved in the corner .
with four minutes of playing , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner .
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely touched the ball .
an ug@@ ly T@@ ackle of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of man Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute , j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ova scored a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new beginning , and there was still more than a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ sured through further weak Tac@@ tics of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a goal .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 while GB still learning .
this is how it is .
GB introduced basic changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova passed through a brilliant inter@@ play by Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton launched an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went off for a long time in favor of the South Se@@ ein@@ sul@@ ans , whose fans sang , flags and danced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds .
the fi@@ ff heard , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged themselves and GB ki@@ cked cr@@ ushing down in the grass .
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated in the semi @-@ final with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain urged South Africa in a tight semi @-@ fin@@ als match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks forward in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a door among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kling by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning who are inspired by the fight with the coach &apos;s cancer
there will be no erotic gold than with these games and that will mean something .
from the first strokes to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve that go into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all present when they row@@ ed to the second Olympic gold in a row without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sports , who laid a scale on such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , their 3@@ 9th diso@@ be@@ dience , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant female athletes who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the nature of the triumph .
behind every gold in the rowing is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who contribute to incre@@ mental advances that make the difference and no one was more instrumental than the coach who did not know 30 months ago whether he would survive this day as cancer was diagnosed with him .
as he said he ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and they did .
if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes slightly the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if that was the right term in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go better soon .
it was an incentive .
I was hospit@@ alized and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
that &apos;s how it starts .
rowing itself is a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of the victory their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a mor@@ alizing morning doing something more than usual and trying to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . that &apos;s maybe a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much this means , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person to train or better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race during the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to catch up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; pale in the process , remain in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t looking for something great .
we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did .
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about their future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to understand that I &apos;m an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exemplary for clarity provided for 31 years
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , reti@@ res . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian far exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Frank@@ ish drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for the large water producers .
some time ago , it was in the original on a contribution by the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
little later , the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia rejected the purpose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian far as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the German Zw@@ eck@@ verband colleague , 28 years as managing director .
he was retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water management association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , annually supports about 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water and supplies 32 locations and ham@@ lets with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member municipalities are the municipalities Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply contracts for other towns and municipalities .
the current chair@@ woman , Breit@@ brunn may@@ oral Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed a water keeper in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the German Association in 1988 .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they range from water management and maintenance work through office and organisation activities , budget@@ ing planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends , &quot; said the president .
as outstanding events she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the renovation of the high container ( 1999 ) , the re@@ purchase of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the re@@ building of water pipes .
there was no stal@@ em@@ ate and there was always new improvements because water is de@@ bit@@ ing and drinking water is the most important food .
in her speech she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers loyal , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he has used a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he has governed the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a true practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe as a nit@@ rate cut in front of the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district .
for this he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , for his part , praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water keeper and he was a faithful kn@@ ack .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from his point of view , he described the well construction and the restructuring of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the rup@@ ture of the blast furnace at Kirch@@ lou@@ der on a 3rd of January .
here we had to work all night at minus 17 degrees , so that the villages could be supplied with water .
also the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained , because one filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water management association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the disease had been known by her son , she believed her to die . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago , however , was well forward and is now learning privately in New York , where the best therapists are there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example : if I ask him something two years ago , when I sang at La Scala , he remembered nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he is the happ@@ i@@ est person on earth .
Ti@@ ago comes from Net@@ reb@@ ko &apos;s connection with the bass @-@ bar@@ it@@ one Er@@ win Sch@@ rott .
she is now married to the tenor Y@@ usi@@ f Ey@@ v@@ az@@ ov .
relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - Man shoots her life partner
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at his partner in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 a.@@ m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man himself called upon us and stated that he shot his companion in life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator was on the run , after him was publicly tram@@ pled .
meanwhile Sven S. could travel by car .
the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a bald .
meanwhile the police have published a photo of him .
it is a few years old however .
in the meantime , the man is wearing a bald .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon with him , such as the police .
those who see Sven S. shall call the 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship at hand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 .
at first , the police in Lü@@ beck intended not to provide any information about the death or the relationship between the perpetr@@ ators and victims ; however , she confirmed that a person had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special mission command ( SE@@ K ) was at the crime scene .
steel - light vision for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ packed and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions of millions .
financial burdens that the industry threatened from green @-@ green promotion are from the table .
the German Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , said the &quot; West German Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z ) , said that it remains with the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Um@@ br@@ ella in the German steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really glad that we could finally reach that after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to this , the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers to use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only if the generators in the steel works are replaced , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent falls .
but also the steel industry is not surv@@ eyed .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation .
thus the status quo of the previous regulation is largely as@@ cri@@ bed .
Gabriel &apos;s successful effort for the steel industry is of particular importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel is the future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of the emissions legislation , climate and employment targets are to be considered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has suffered from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year , the situation worsen@@ ed when the world &apos;s largest producer country China threw mass steel onto the world market in view of the fla@@ gging domestic demand .
European manufacturers repro@@ ach Chinese steel companies price dump@@ ing .
in the course of this spring , the situation has relaxed a little .
on the one hand , imposed import duties on import @-@ steel impact , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China have increased .
it is unclear how long the price collection is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , prices would have stagn@@ ated .
the industry re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
last but not least Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp did not want to exclude the closing of individual works .
around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July , despite rising prices and increasing orders , German steel manufacturers are cau@@ tious .
at 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Business Association announced on Friday .
after a short increase in May the produced amount went back for the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production has been two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
as a result of an improved order situation , the association anticip@@ ates an increase in the order situation in the coming months .
community , spirit , health : singing does good for sen@@ iors
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has always accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir , she finished the subject of music in the teacher &apos;s school , and today the 78 year old sings in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and more lively , she says .
by the way , she does something good in her health and mind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German retirement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bundes@@ retirement &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
regular cooperation allows sen@@ iors to soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures dissolve in the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has also made this experience in her choir : &quot; to speak and organise oneself , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
singing can be stren@@ uous in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for this purpose , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly challenge their lungs are not so fast from the pu@@ dding even in everyday life .
even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice at the age , Sing@@ ing is an optimal hobby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older people often have a very special effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Association of the Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Organis@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the older generations , the common singing had a much higher value , it was part of everyday life , both in school and in leisure time , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening of songs in older people stimulates many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their adol@@ escence .
due to lyrics and especially melodies , people who suffer from dementia suffer from long @-@ standing events .
while singing , the head is also required to perform special performance , explains L@@ enz .
at the same time focusing on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - that &apos;s a great cognitive challenge .
just older people who live alone do so not only to concentrate on themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
even the self @-@ esteem grows through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I practise for a long time , I become better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start singing is enough .
if you want to try a new hobby , don &apos;t hesitate - even if he thinks that you have little talent , L@@ enz advises .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who can hear when there &apos;s a tone next to it ?
looking for the right offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of friends in a retirement choir , one can simply join .
many cities also offer insights on the choirs in the area .
whoever wants to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church leader .
many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet .
if you don &apos;t have access to the internet , the family , friends or neighbors can ask for help with the internet research .
those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing is good for the soul and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to any age .
cats react more sensi@@ tively as han@@ go@@ vers at scre@@ ams of k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have examined in Hanover what effect the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens have on adult animals .
to their surprise , the mi@@ str@@ ust also did not let the males cold - however , they always beha@@ ved the same in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the patho@@ gen level of k@@ itt@@ ens at the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
they respond to sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens ten percent faster than scientists from the Veter@@ inary University and the Hannover Medical School ( M@@ H@@ H ) have found out .
males react also to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly excited k@@ itt@@ ens for the males are either not percep@@ tible , or not of importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the M@@ H@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she is the invent@@ or of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
in a previous study , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens scre@@ ams was different with the ur@@ gency of their need for help .
a total of nine adult males and eight k@@ itt@@ ens were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ H@@ H .
they were played for a rep@@ ut@@ ation of little ones , taken out of the throw box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens who were raised in addition .
the researchers regard their results in spite of the small sample for meaningful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who haven &apos;t had their own offspring , responded differently to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned themselves faster to the loudspeaker when this rep@@ ut@@ ations were played out of the more excited k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may possibly be con@@ genital or develop with sexual maturity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already resear@@ ched the reactions of women and men on baby sounds several times in humans .
also , some studies showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to babies , whether they were already mothers or not , reported the bi@@ ologist Marina Sch@@ um@@ ann .
Po@@ dol@@ ski resorts to Super@@ cup with &quot; Gala &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ chi@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ chi@@ r in Turkey .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , another important football match takes place in Turkey .
before the Du@@ el of the arch@@ a@@ vers between Bes@@ ik@@ tas , Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual . &quot;
even at the im@@ position of the state of emergency after the coup d &quot; é@@ tat in July , the government , the daily life of normal citizens , was not affected .
but this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the Movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
even before football it is not stopped .
against the former strong i@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ chi@@ r , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office issued an arrest warrant .
accordingly , the South Coast living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ mach@@ r is said to be a member of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days is still valid until October , but in fact it has no effect on the lives of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the noc@@ tur@@ nal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan to be finished on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - divided into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
but what unites the rum@@ our of the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ts .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cup winner , it will be especially on Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past season , Cologne proved its sporting value : at 17 gates and nine models in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first time as a top @-@ sc@@ orer of his club .
in the final game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory figure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and his team secured the tro@@ phy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the round @-@ round kno@@ ck@@ out of the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; will leave early in the Europa League too early .
in the Sü@@ per Li@@ g , it only reached rank six .
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we did it and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the game year was better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who laid the foundation for the 14th title with 26 season hits as Sü@@ pers @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ ment@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig .
this is also the reason that the fans will continue to hope for the return of the 31 year old .
in doing so , the Gom@@ ez , lying under the agreement with AC Florence , had announced only bor@@ rowing Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt to not return because of the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Má@@ ri@@ ó wants to come to us , he only has to say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the specialist magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club Director Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the stri@@ ker would have to be willing to renoun@@ ce about one third of his annual salary of 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man stated : &quot; we cannot pay his salary in Florence . &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes still have med@@ als opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova cannot start in Rio .
other Ath@@ le@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they struggle in Rio to med@@ als .
the topic of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
the Russian swi@@ mmer , Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ owa , who after a dop@@ ing barri@@ ster compla@@ ined about her starting right shortly before the games , became mer@@ cil@@ essly sw@@ ung out and ki@@ cked off at her start ( 100 meters chest ) .
it offered itself a bizarre scene : with a set smile , she was still standing in the hall and prov@@ oked her appearance .
when she realized that she wasn &apos;t going to get gold , the audience burst into a jam @-@ storm .
but there are many more sports@@ men going to the start despite their dop@@ ing past at the Olympic Games in Rio .
here is an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since his spell over the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion has been running even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is regarded as the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m relay / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic Champion and seven times world champion had to sit down for a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after receiving the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after an operation , she had strong tooth@@ ache and defended the 29 @-@ year @-@ old .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic Champion , world champion in 2013 and European champion from 2010 to 2016 , was tested positively on the banned stimul@@ ant substance meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin .
Per@@ kovic denied the sent@@ in@@ tive intake and was closed for six months .
the four far@@ th@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great gold favorite .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400@@ m relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , was tested positive in 2010 and was closed for 21 months .
a means of penis enlargement was responsible , bet@@ ted Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer Th@@ row , Bel@@ or@@ ussi@@ a ) : hardly any athlete has been recognized as many med@@ als afterwards .
thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after it was determined by him testosterone dop@@ ing .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to hand over Olympia @-@ silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM title 2006 because of testosterone ab@@ uses .
he also received the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games because of a judgment of the International Sports Court CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m it ranks second in the world rank@@ ings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record scientist and gold favor@@ i@@ tin was tested positive only in May , but may still start in Rio .
in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world championships , evidence of taking a banned health supplement was found , the lock of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency WA@@ DA made mild and ran off on July 13 .
bombing terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is standing in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she had suffered cutting @-@ ups and had been treated in hospital , but I was able to leave it again .
her home trip was planned for the beginning of September .
whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ umph@@ on also Austrian citizens are still unclear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities , such as waste .
at approximately 200 kilometres south of Bangkok &apos;s capital Hu@@ a H@@ in explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday night in a Night@@ life .
according to the police , a Tha@@ il@@ lig@@ in was killed and about 20 people were injured , among them the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning two bla@@ sting sets went up again , and another person was killed according to the authorities .
Ph@@ u@@ ket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning .
a taxi driver was injured in the det@@ on@@ ation near the beach town of Pat@@ ong , which was popular with tourists .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south east coast of the country another bomb explo@@ ded , killing a city cler@@ k .
according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the prec@@ inct of the coastal police .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ western coast and in Ch@@ umph@@ on on the Sou@@ theast Coast demanded several wounded .
it was said that there was a connection with the explo@@ sions of Hu@@ a H@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks bear the same signature , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ ch@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that this is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express themselves to potential motives - however , it is likely to be the acts of Muslim rebels .
in the attacks also Thai media wanted to see a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamic resistance movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage that is limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is rather assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta have been laid .
the authorities would have kept secret notes on upcoming attacks in the south of the country in recent days - however , they were not informed about the exact time and places .
it is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
the police proved their officials throughout the country to enhance safety around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are still smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but mostly they do not address tourists .
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used for years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the actual bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions issued by the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its surroundings .
after clas@@ hes between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no need for necessary journeys to these provinces .
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drawn up by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the coming years .
Jun@@ ta head and prime minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country moves towards stability , an improvement in economic conditions and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody un@@ rest , benefits himself to have led the Kingdom back to stability and order .
however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the revol@@ ting revol@@ t of Muslim rebels in the far south of the country for years .
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago , in Bangkok , 20 people were killed at a stop in a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office for constitutional protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several national offices , the conserv@@ ation@@ ists in the Con@@ federation have also placed the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see evidence of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic basic order , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said constitutional chief Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ison of the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus immigrants from Islamic faith or the Middle East are being diver@@ ted in extrem@@ ist ways .
that is why we are now watching the movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it turns against &quot; mul@@ ticul@@ tur@@ alism , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s identity through alien@@ ation . &quot;
the &quot; Identi@@ ties &quot; are already observed in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Nieder@@ sachsen , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia .
Ma@@ eating said that his authority was closely aligned with the local offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups such as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chief of the Constitution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
extre@@ mi@@ sts generally try to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with pop music .
the identi@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as legal extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a real advertising for your own cause .
the propaganda is intended to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are in a special way vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , there have been reports of contacts of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ eating said he didn &apos;t have any knowledge .
possible contacts of this kind are only relevant for constitutional protection from a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , changes their direction and becomes so extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor here is whether such persons have control over the party .
this is not apparent .
with a view to the significant increase in ri@@ gh@@ tist crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee camps , Ma@@ eating said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context .
but in recent years we have found that it is possible to give state @-@ terrorism structures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Old School Society &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Free &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it may well be that further anti @-@ terrorism group@@ ings or small groups are formed that plan attacks against asylum seekers , against asylum seekers , or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
however , a German@@ - wide or pan @-@ European regulation of legal terrorism cannot be seen .
the previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks .
Ma@@ ate expressed concern about the fact that there were many attacks on the account of people who had not appeared in the right scene beforehand .
this is wor@@ rying .
many of the susp@@ ects at attacks on asylum @-@ homes had previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or followers of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed criminal off@@ ences which had previously had nothing to do with legal extre@@ mi@@ sts who might have been politically in@@ different , or for example CD@@ U , SPD or lef@@ ti@@ sts , which , however , have radi@@ cal@@ ised themselves by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ its becomes inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always the Olympic Games or world records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the brave appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros haw@@ ks at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia moved so slowly that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ es subsequently became a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old completed his lead with a set@@ back of 48 seconds and took the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not exactly athle@@ tic figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries more well @-@ known .
since most athletes are running in Ethiopia , they just wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names quickly made the rounds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media called him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ bel der W@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; following a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ being &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was funny with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 @-@ meter fre@@ estyle , played no role .
compar@@ isons with Eric the E@@ el were also drawn .
at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i ensured media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool in Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete on his own in a pre @-@ run over 100 metres of Fre@@ estyle .
M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump does not see the im@@ pending electoral defeat too narrow
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump speaks at an election campaign in Florida .
if there is nothing to do with the election of the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has an alternative vide@@ ot@@ ape .
he then drives on vacation .
if Donald Tr@@ ump is losing the US presidential elections in November , it doesn &apos;t matter : &quot; ultimately , either , or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the US television station CN@@ BC .
if it does not suff@@ ice for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , this is al@@ right , said Tr@@ ump .
so he called US President Barack Obama and the democr@@ ats of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) .
more and more resistance was being formed within his party .
mail goes into trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously great .
the post is planning to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter as well .
the Group will shortly want to start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
as of next year , the post office wants to offer its electric v@@ ans even on the free market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been testing for months whether they want to sell their own developed street sco@@ oter , with which letters and par@@ c@@ els are shipped , also to other companies .
the post @-@ chairman Ju@@ er@@ gen Ger@@ d had said that there are always inquiries , for example by craftsmen .
according to the news magazine Der Spiegel , the Bonn Group wants to enter the mass production of the vehicles soon .
the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and layer in its own factory .
Ger@@ d had announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and to make long @-@ term changes to the environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we complete the entire fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter is active in Germany &apos;s streets since 2014 .
GF@@ RP @-@ leadership adop@@ ts dis@@ ap@@ pointing results
the Gf@@ K consumer research company exchanges its head Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the rel@@ ap@@ ts suddenly came - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K made it clear that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann became even more in@@ secure , the longer the success promised by him .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Gf@@ K market research company : after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of the company management , the worldwide number Five of the industry faces a new beginning .
GF@@ K CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board , Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert , already leaves the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September .
the management board of the Management Board already took over the previous member of the Management Board of Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger on 1 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shall officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive Officer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor is found for Hart@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a reason for the returns , the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the long @-@ term business direction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details did not want to call a company spokes@@ man on Friday .
it is still unclear who will be conducting the market research company in the future .
in investor circles it was said on Friday , in the event of the shareholders , the disappointment of the continued success of the restructuring measures introduced several years ago was great .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K peak since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of restructuring have not yet been seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the recent poor ST@@ P business figures , each shareholder will eventually become rest@@ less .
&quot; if that was the case with BMW , that would make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; he said .
after set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company did not have the chance to stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 .
at € 36@@ 1.2 million , sales fell by 6.1 percent below the comparable period of the previous year .
in relation to the first half of the year , sales declined by 3.4 percent to EUR 7@@ 2@@ 1.2 million .
the profit in the second quarter imp@@ acted above all the lower value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation .
the company &apos;s impairment charges amoun@@ ting to EUR 139 million in the Consumer Experience division were a loss of € 14@@ 8.2 million .
the Gf@@ K generated a net profit of 19.@@ 7 million in the second quarter of 2015 .
accidents - bus sli@@ ps in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n@@ in Gra@@ ben : eight injured
in an accident of a coach with 43 senior citizens , eight people have been injured in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ unk@@ n ( district Aur@@ ich ) on Thursday .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , told the police .
according to her specifications , the 66 @-@ year @-@ old coach of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to her specifications , had to avoid a truck coming in opposite direction .
the bus came to the right of the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , as reported by a spokes@@ woman of the Police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ gade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and a ambul@@ ance caravan came to the accident site on the state road 2 .
the un@@ injured travellers were brought back to the district of P@@ ew@@ all by a bus bus .
there they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the truck drivers and possible witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic meter of waste water will be 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros for the area of the Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ to / Wel@@ sh@@ ahl sewage plant from October 1 , 2016 ; for allowance mountain / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( up to now 2.@@ 18 Euro ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the waste water charge will be increased at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are needed .
after a clear calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will be 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , in the approval of the household by the District Office of Kul@@ mb@@ ach , it was established that under covers for these wastewater facilities .
due to the legal basis , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the systems cost @-@ effectively .
as of 1 October 2016 , the citizens as well as the trade and industrial companies from the first half of the world , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to go deeper into the pur@@ se .
revenue increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Director of the Board of Directors Herbert Schmidt showed the panel , a new calculation of charges for the sewage plants of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - and under@@ cover from the previous period of calculation can also be compensated .
Schmidt explained the serious fee increases in all three wastewater facilities with relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
due to the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact .
in addition , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining .
furthermore , due to their age refurb@@ ishment and repair expenses , all three plants will continue to appeal to a significant extent in all three plants .
the facility in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for the world &apos;s ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p are almost 20 years old .
Schmidt explained that the sewage plant in Az@@ endorf had to replace the mechanical ventilation system due to a damage .
after almost 20 years of operation the first sewage pond had to be removed , the sewage slu@@ dge was dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation system was installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; this extraordinary expenditure resulted in the continued care and maintenance costs , which must be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which are still clearly below the current level during the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made it clear that the expendi@@ tures for operation and maintenance fell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the low waste water fall in the three plants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs , has been spar@@ ed by the sewage plants over the past 20 years .
in the view of stone houses , the situation for the above @-@ mentioned facilities will continue to remain prec@@ arious , particularly as the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ en@@ ba@@ cht@@ al wastewater treatment association could not be extended by these facilities because it is a deficit .
Bulgaria records inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that in July , inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , compared to a positive 0.2 % .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured after the CP@@ I -@@ 0,8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison to the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic drinks ( 1,7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
prices remained as pre @-@ month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education remained unchanged .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critic@@ ised
Sn@@ ap@@ chat states that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say that it is in@@ sensitive to breeds .
with its filtering tool , Sn@@ ap@@ chat allows around 150 million daily users to change the reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders on the absurd .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from Roy Licht@@ enstein &apos;s painting .
the filters are bl@@ ended , stand@@ alone tools that generate more than 30 million sel@@ fies per day .
all the mistakes are brought to the public .
in the past Sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have cri@@ tiqu@@ ed criticism in which they were accused of promoting Black face or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week proposed a filter to some users who gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics named it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; Yellow haw@@ k . &quot;
they asked if these repeated controversi@@ es had caused a bigger problem that the company had a lot of diversity .
the news and ou@@ trage were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , one day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat announced that it had de@@ activated the feature .
the company had an ap@@ ology : the filter meant homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of inf@@ ring@@ ing c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ ets were widely used over the photos , said that the filter was &quot; hur@@ ting and the least said to be unpleasant . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contradictory Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and filter effects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ish @-@ proof , but that the yellow face was dra@@ gged into the fra@@ cking extreme .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand .
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are more diverse than their older opponents - might expect to expect sensitivity .
if one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates a picture that is offensive to a user , it is much more difficult for such things to stay un@@ noticed than it was the case before , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu , who works as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium , decided to delete her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay on media and in a telephone interview , she said she believes that racial controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the sn@@ ap@@ chat setting practices .
Z@@ hu also critici@@ zed the large part white , only male leadership and ended her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chin@@ es@@ ich @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colours that work there , but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable in order to say something about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that has largely left Sn@@ ap@@ chat un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and indicates its status as a private company .
on Thursday Sn@@ ap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently hired a personnel officer concentrating on sub @-@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu also said that she will keep her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account closed and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users than us to say that it is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military leadership fal@@ si@@ fies IS@@ IS intelligence , establishes Committee of Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to draw up an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when it allowed the actual conditions on the ground , reporting a committee of inquiry in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can Members of the Com@@ for@@ cements Com@@ mittees , intelligence committees and military budget committee , reports of great dis@@ content among Central Command sec@@ rec@@ y analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligence services typically det@@ ectable by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders posted a positive picture of US efforts against terrorism as it had allowed actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted a newspaper article . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what happened in the Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can Member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives .
the leadership mistakes in the Cent@@ Com range to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents in detail the continual problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence that government tips have given directions to change reports , it shows how analysts exposed to pressure from their superi@@ ors , to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , comments and statements before Congress were much more positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com investor publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , it is so clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , Central Command &apos;s leaders changed the intelligence reports to play down the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called Task Force into life after they were admitted that analysts worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed findings during the investigation .
in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are under way by the Secretary General of the Defense Department .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced the highest @-@ ranking demo@@ crat in the committee , a member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the moral of analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave too little room for devi@@ ating opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats did not give any reference to the intervention of the White House with the Cent@@ Com analy@@ st about a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon &apos;s general inspec@@ tor , who were admitted to complaints by Cent@@ Com analysts .
according to C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , there was a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the reports of the congress , while the investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ tor were still under way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion which is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of sub @-@ activities of more than ten years ago when a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush only fores@@ aw a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker stated that contrary to the statements made by the government , air@@ strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these provisional refin@@ eries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
however , this knowledge was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger orders , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legislature because of his over@@ ly positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin was retired in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the United States wins fourth match in the field hockey of women , a show@@ down with the UK is pending
one day after having shot three goals during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the American women won 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games were supposed to be a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their goals in mind .
but they know : the American women are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , which remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter final , the game will decide which of the two will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first place will take the strong Dut@@ ch@@ man a little longer from the path that the other group will lead .
whatever the game takes place on Saturday , the American women have triggered a surprising whi@@ rl@@ wind of their success story , four years after they landed in the last London Games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had a Ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ bat in her hands for the first time with three years ( her two older sisters played sports at Dre@@ xel University ) , at the age of 16 , she became national player in the United States , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 because she couldn &apos;t qualify for the squ@@ ad .
then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the national team and thus began to turn things to better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , mental change and physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we did not have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
we have completely ro@@ cked the ru@@ dder .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the door in the first half of the game with a back@@ lash from the local area .
India went into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the center and kno@@ cked the ball into the gate to get the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 guide .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wherever you are , as late it is , it &apos;s the Olympics .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel steadily and inevitable , a fast relay race between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stick , which is passed from the w@@ rist@@ band to a swi@@ mmer to the tri@@ athlete .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour &apos;s conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time with the Olympics and a s@@ warm of women with dimples , could have been among these well @-@ known names sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV advertising , if it were a swi@@ mmer , gym@@ ner , or even fen@@ cers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event equal .
further from the centre , partly in the shadow are the sports that are not universally recognized : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast@@ stroke and may it reign for a long time .
but if I would like to make arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although jumping on a trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , it was so sc@@ ant@@ y that many of those I had questioned were not aware that it was a sport for the Olympics .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to compete , it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and had an athlete up to 2012 who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian women for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the trampoline jumping has a certain out@@ sider character , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ lown school than the one for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I &apos;m not an expert , but I &apos;m just one enthusi@@ ast enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ istic potential - the me@@ at@@ onic tre@@ mor of his never @-@ ending boun@@ ce - but also the grace of doing gymnas@@ tics and diving , the two sports that essentially unites them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; jumping board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up @-@ and @-@ coming winners jump on a giant trampoline , shoot up to 30 feet in the air and have to hit a number of falling moti@@ ons ( turning , fen@@ cing and sal@@ tos ) before landing on their feet .
according to the official Olympic program , they are evaluated according to execution , difficulty level and &quot; flight time . &quot;
two @-@ day athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio against each other .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight forward .
medal hopes have to go further , faster , up and down in their quest for gold , sometimes up to the goal , sometimes back and forth , upwards and down@@ wards on the playground .
they do not only ch@@ ase the finish line or the starting wall , but also a further highlight in the television transmission : the world or the Olympic team .
the goal @-@ oriented aspir@@ ation is pos@@ h , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it is also what I feel fati@@ gu@@ ing even when watching these games .
the trampoline offers an breathing spell .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward motion is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , apparently wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then eff@@ ort@@ lessly upwards .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the target , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it &apos;s as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympics .
the qualification and final rounds of the women will be held on Friday afternoon , in the streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; that of the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will ex@@ ude the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 2 : 00 p.m .
in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a calm , nice moment , one that is likely to be over@@ looked in the general tur@@ mo@@ il .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the fri@@ e@@ zing and the obj@@ ec@@ tification of male athletes - as the male U.S. gym@@ na@@ sts recently suggested - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan base to go to air .
&quot; a generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long is an ally of the US
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators calling for political changes in Ethiopia met with the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses testi@@ fies that tens of prot@@ esters were killed during clas@@ hes with the police during firing changes .
is Ethiopia able to collapse right now ?
in the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into more and more areas .
last week , thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response has been ruth@@ less .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot dead on un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators and killed them .
videos about the protests that are probably from the last or beginning of this year show how security people hit young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Council now demands a thorough investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to combat terror haz@@ ards across the region , particularly in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital of Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , whereby dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and don &apos;t have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ am@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
after a far @-@ reaching election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament .
at the same time , tensions are rising along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a fight for this sha@@ ky , controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June .
analysts are concerned that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den , which have been forced more or less in recent years , can exploit the turbul@@ ence and arm themselves again .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness after years of getting t@@ ink@@ ly beneath the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate via social media since cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more common and internet services improved .
even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are .
several young Ethiop@@ ians allowed them to join the protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons the Am@@ har@@ as , who predominantly come from Ethiopia , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and live in flat land areas .
but this is also changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to coordinate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests took place in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fair@@ istically dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray who account for about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military , intelligence services , trade and politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister until his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 for 17 years .
he was regarded as a tactical genius , a man who could think around corners .
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ content and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present regime lacks this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for obsc@@ ure reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia experienced such a uph@@ eav@@ al was in 2005 after thousands prot@@ ested against elections , seemingly fu@@ eled by the government according to the analysts and then stolen .
during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if they were less than in the last few months and that time of turbul@@ ence passed relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , and their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction .
but obviously this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month , prot@@ esters attacked Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an city , businesses conducted by Tig@@ ray and hate against the Tig@@ ray is becoming more common in social media .
analysts say that the protests will bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a base for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flug across the neighboring Somalia , even though it recently announced that it has closed this base .
while the West wants to support democracy clearly , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tr@@ ump sums up his claim Obama had established IS@@ IS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , Donald J. Tr@@ ump was trying to sc@@ atter the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking that his repeated claim , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton , would have been the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious .
this clari@@ fication raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republi@@ can presidential candidates , whether he is able to communicate clearly and understand@@ ably with the American public .
it also brings its associates , who endeav@@ our to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase , into the peculiar position , to declare statements which he could not have meant .
having made the hint at an election campaign event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump calling back on Thursday claimed that he really did not intend to interpret , the president and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning twe@@ ets Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ cas@@ tically .
the T@@ we@@ et was the opposite to the previous day Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he meant the accus@@ ation completely seriously .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tr@@ ump to weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it .
the last storm of criticism spark@@ les down on Mr. Tr@@ ump while he has tried to steer the focus of his campaign because of falling survey results on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton kept talking about the economic situation in Mich@@ ig@@ an this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this subject again .
on Twitter he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he had a strong criticism when he said that the Russians were to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but he later explained , &quot; Of course I said that sar@@ cas@@ tically . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then call back on demand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive , and then , if necessary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to how the reaction fails . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert that monitors the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I also believe he is clever enough to hold his statements vag@@ u@@ ely enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has accepted an even more corro@@ sive tone , as his survey figures have gone further .
a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was released on Friday , showed a leading lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humour .
but while empha@@ sizing the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent advoc@@ ates of tr@@ umps , was struggling to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comment@@ aries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani to the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called it Hinter@@ b@@ än@@ kler , completely wrong and that &apos;s why it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to argue that the Obama administration , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister , allowed IS@@ IS to expand by allowing the situation in the Middle East to be aggressive under control .
before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of jumping around on each of his words and being prejudi@@ ced against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , miserable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts trying to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats ap@@ ologi@@ zed to Mr. Tr@@ ump as a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the Pres@@ i@@ dency .
once more than the price of the market disp@@ l@@ aces , cafe in Green@@ point will come back
Ver@@ b Cafe was a big@@ amy café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash that didn &apos;t have Wi @-@ Fi but served for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front were displaced .
the shop So@@ ap Cher@@ ie , which replaced Ver@@ b in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local bet@@ ro@@ thed it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that C@@ BGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but when New York is change it is also new invention .
a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ time employee of the old coffee shop , the owner and managing director of the new coffee bar .
he started working with Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a customer offered to provide funds for a new outdoor table , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment too .
he introduced new ingredients .
the menu includes sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and there are shri@@ mps like cap@@ ers and sau@@ ced onions .
there are natural rice dishes .
the café serves no beer anymore , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers have also been displaced by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly .
even after moving to Green@@ point , she would take the road .
when the calf was closed , she gave up coffee for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized that it was the coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she &apos;s drinking coffee again , even though she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long@@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before work and inevitably ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came fourth after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal always gets his usual order , but sometimes he altern@@ ates his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no gru@@ dge against the fact that the soap store occupied the old business space .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered to make a special soap for Ver@@ b with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of coffee as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go into the offer yet , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabit@@ ant Green@@ points also accepted the café .
a new client has translated the menu to the Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had to leave her soon , so that his new neighbors would feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice store wants to bottle and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee .
there is a chance that the café is expanding to a neighboring building .
for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favour@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to smell it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rich meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the President Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a gourmet , President Roosev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined delicacies from Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land &apos;s ter@@ rap@@ ine soup .
his menu on that day was a bit more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Bri@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was about Chinese cuisine in the USA , while bri@@ ck@@ led in their book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about living in a residential house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A decent meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they show culinary solidarity when they meet with a re@@ porter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , local snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
bri@@ ck@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate .
when the re@@ porter ordered hack@@ ers , this found the couple suitable for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man said .
there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , cream cheese and p@@ opp@@ y bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a bit of cheap which stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have settled in the stomach as lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cooked for male Fel@@ lows and it was served freshly baked past@@ es for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; marks the way the country was going to be no longer the land of Cock@@ a@@ Land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food was a central , ten@@ se topic in the food for the Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e beg@@ ged why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as ten@@ se was the new budget : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became a stap@@ le food , the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food resi@@ dues , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man noted , as coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a creamy sauce .
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
meat , which was the focal point of American cuisine for years , became a rare luxury .
peculiar mix@@ tures were tried out because a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious grati@@ fication had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen @-@ sense .
during her research for the book that includes recipes , Ziegel@@ man prepared a dish of this era , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addition for lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ mann continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the house business recipes .
like never before , or ever since , household econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - have shaped the country &apos;s eating habits .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ wives &quot; and the challenge of converting P@@ amp@@ e like creamy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a celebration of historical delicacies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
particularly tasty are the reports of the government &apos;s response to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ food attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa rural cuisine of his kitchen , he spoke like the million @-@ million man of the world to whom he became .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost golden dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was really strange to reality .
President Roosev@@ elt would perhaps have committed the same mistake , if Ele@@ an@@ or his wife had urged him to cancel an examination with his stomach .
as described in the book , the host of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by wife Roosev@@ elt caused the White House to produce the most boring meal in Washington , but also one of the most controversial . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food , was disc@@ arded as soon as the country returned to its legs .
the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , Bri@@ ck@@ man said , as well as how science was applied to foods .
the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Bri@@ ck@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for example , how they could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of wa@@ sting food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man rec@@ alled : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they really made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the drop in the wind .
after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they drew up a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert , which President Roosev@@ elt had lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man said , and added that it was a nasty trick to give modest recipes a nice name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
each di@@ ved somewhat reluct@@ antly one spoon into the t@@ ame , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it did not taste bad .
Co@@ E took a stop three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a Can @-@ Do bud@@ sman , he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Some chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything in order to save the life of others .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old himself died during a barrel bomb attack on the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil defence group which , according to the Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved nearly 60@@ ,000 people .
29@@ 00 volunteers set their own lives in order to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war area .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civilian contractor rej@@ ecting him during an 11 @-@ hour rescue from the rub@@ ble of a house was around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbolic figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he never saw himself as a hero , but he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For me this is the real ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die to save lives , I think that God sees me as a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself attacked an attack on the victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters dropped four barrel bombs above the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now removing the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ nants of the bomb to prevent children from playing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image quoted his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Assad regime &apos;s deadly bomb had to strike terrorists .
Greenland shar@@ k : the oldest ed@@ dy is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland sh@@ arks usually come to the surface only in winter .
this ha@@ i was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland sh@@ arks will only get offspring with 150 years of age .
the Green@@ land@@ shar@@ k swi@@ ms lei@@ surely at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it reaches just 1,@@ 220 meters on average .
only when it matters , the five @-@ meter @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast with this top speed as a seal .
this lifestyle shaped lifestyle seems to be a patent recipe for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at least by a Greenland shar@@ k , who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein from the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock , this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates .
although the evolutionary bi@@ ologist suspected that Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks are becoming a stone age .
only the evidence was lacking .
Greenland sh@@ arks are hard to observe , finally they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface only in winter .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sh@@ arks .
their slow motion , measured in front of S@@ val@@ bard , measured six animals with a transmitter .
nevertheless , this sh@@ arks make this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
they may ch@@ ase sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the polar sea and look for cad@@ aver , which tor@@ ques from higher water layers downward .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland sh@@ arks which caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the biggest 50@@ 2 cen@@ timeter measured .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed using the carbon @-@ 14 method the lens nucle@@ us of the sh@@ arks .
this center of the eye lens arises already before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained in it are later no longer renewed .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .
therefore , their birth was to be in the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons hunt larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the length of the third smallest animal with a length of 220 centimet@@ ers , the l@@ enti@@ l nucle@@ us , on the other hand , contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , so its 50@@ th birthday would probably have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
all larger Greenland sh@@ arks , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities in their lens nucle@@ us , resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the Carbon @-@ 14 Clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 years for a 4@@ 93 @-@ cen@@ timeter @-@ long Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ shar@@ k , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers might be even 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to associate the length with an age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ ers probably stood at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years , Greenland &apos;s ha@@ ie with the increase obviously has at least one and a half centuries of time .
this is also likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
it is no coincidence that such methane emissions live mainly in icy waters .
also the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 @-@ year @-@ old Greenland w@@ al , in whose bacon on the neck a 120 year old har@@ po@@ on tip was stuck , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on spar@@ ring flames .
so they later mature and age slower .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often very big .
the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal receives heat .
the loss of heat from one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : they have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal is therefore more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as soon as possible , &quot; explains the Evol@@ ution@@ bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein .
a very big animal should , on the other hand , invest his resources in a long life .
building site in a double pack
the council at the recent meeting focused on topics relating to construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the panel received the announcement of mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recently proven residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the real estate , plot and access questions were clari@@ fied and the applications could be sur@@ veying , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; Road lane &quot; and &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; ( section 1 ) to interested parties is no longer in the way .
the municipal council is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schö@@ nau appeal to young families and the elderly alike .
as it was said , building will@@ s can now report in the town hall , and the municipal council is expected to consult the municipal council in its September meeting .
in order to make inquiries about the reloc@@ ation of further business enterprises , combined with the creation of jobs , the council decided to change the land use plan newly created in the spring of this year .
in the area of Lower @-@ time lar@@ n , the industrial area already declared there will be extended by two plots towards the state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt profits from Bre@@ x@@ it
accordingly , the City of Main has the best opportunities to attract jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence field of financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum it is uncertain whether banks should continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
admission to the so @-@ called EU passport is already sufficient for them in the UK .
that &apos;s what big US banks are using .
several banks have already announced to reloc@@ ate jobs .
the lobby association &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; comp@@ utes with 10@@ 000 new jobs in the Main within five years .
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervision E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk basket ES@@ R@@ B .
while in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg is home to a large fund sector , but just like Dublin doesn &apos;t cut in the infrastructure .
thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt is much easier to achieve .
furthermore , the city has easily available commercial real estate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris , it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , renting for first @-@ class commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than the River Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition , thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the company counsel@@ ing Mer@@ cer , the city stands on seventh place , Luxemburg in number 19 , Dublin on No@@ .@@ 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preferences : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe , my econom@@ ist .
the balance of forces also speaks for this : in London , according to figures of Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry in the end of 2015 , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. Local Court ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal costs incurred by the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was exemp@@ ted from a claim for damages amoun@@ ting to $ 200 million for the injury of two patents from Mer@@ ck , which stood in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including Mein@@ ur@@ der and other un@@ ethical acts .
in the case of the suit filed on Thursday , U.S. Ambassador Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is right at the expense of the costs incurred during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ ate Gilead that controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck took possession of each other and appropri@@ ated property on laboratory works to which Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir landed , the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead .
U.S. backed troops say that they have reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
the US backed troops have rec@@ ap@@ tured full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters in the city left them , a spokes@@ man of the group said on Friday .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are cur@@ tail@@ ed after the expul@@ sion of the still remaining group of fighters who have buried within the city , currently the city .
they have freed more than 2,000 civilians who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j military council of Reu@@ ters who was al@@ lied with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is under complete control now , but we just run clean @-@ up work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
clin@@ tons make $ 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton published her tax return on Friday for 2015 , which resulted in the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton &apos;s USD 1 million donated for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton raised USD 5.3 million from Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster publishing house for her book about her term in the State Department .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the vice @-@ president , Sen@@ ator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton published his tax returns from the last ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards regarding financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ trac@@ ers in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax returns .
it is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns , although they are not obliged to do so by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers as a reason for his refusal to tax a tax audit by the tax authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clin@@ tons &apos;s election campaign hel@@ per Ian S@@ ams on Twitter in terms of the publication of the Democrats &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presidential candidate &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , a special consultant , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish anything before the tax inspections were not completed .
the critics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business units and various other connections , in particular with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown himself on the subject and published a video on Friday in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump invites Tr@@ ump to publish his tax return .
on Thursday she spoke about the issue during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ ig@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax returns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO has reported that during the 1990s , Tr@@ ump hasn &apos;t paid any or only very little taxes , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants who said that this could still be the case .
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a scheme that is named after billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett which would make sure that people who earn more than USD 1 million will pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in the past week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its seat here , Tr@@ ump to exchange their tax returns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a tax check of the I@@ RS and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the voters and not to the tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons &apos;s campaign has released tax return until 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , on average , paid an effective federal tax rate of approximately 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 40@@ ,5 % .
the 2015 tax return showed that only USD 100 of its income was related to wages , unlike most Americans .
their main investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the clin@@ tons distributed divi@@ den@@ ds and revenues of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 .

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ dens , fire@@ works support Tanz@@ ani@@ as Ele@@ fan@@ ten@@ ance
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going in people living settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them which are filled with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ ffs .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ ard Foundation , which had the idea for years ago , has strengthened its funding along with US nature conservation by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crops without inj@@ uring animals .
before that , many sp@@ ears used to defend themselves .
Friday is World Wide Day , dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have developed the tool@@ kit we could observe a change in their attitudes within these communities , and they are much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants away from their fields without damaging the elephant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Managing Director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first two steps involve illumin@@ ating the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if he is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together with a fire@@ work body , ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition switch .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom burst with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust in the air .
a touch is usually sufficient to ch@@ ase the elephant .
one last possibility is an adverti@@ ser firing a gold fil@@ ler in the air , causing a loud , light explosion .
Stad@@ thalle resol@@ ves unanim@@ ously : no ki@@ osk re@@ building at St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer
normally , St. Go@@ ar@@ er &apos;s investment projects of commercial entrepreneurs engage with K@@ us@@ sh@@ and - but the retail trade in the core city is considered to be considerably exp@@ and@@ able .
however , the municipal council now unanim@@ ously rejected the proposal for a new building of a sale ski at the Rhine shore in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine basin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we welcome new businesses , but at this location in an exposed position on the banks of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk would not fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director dis@@ sol@@ ves Berlin hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; demand - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media watch after betra@@ ying that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pre @-@ election since it had claimed Arab guests according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country &apos;s country selection list .
the country , however , was not listed between the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to choose Israel through its own call center .
looking for an explanation , the director addressed the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sho@@ wered him &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel employee said the measure was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel management . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it triggered even more anger in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is er@@ ased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great dis@@ grace &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were app@@ alled and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
this is really very embarrass@@ ing .
the fact that this took place in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large resonance on the Internet , in which people called it sc@@ andal@@ ous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some subordin@@ ate to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indul@@ ged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alleged aff@@ or@@ estation of Arab guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in another article , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , stands near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly referred to all alle@@ gations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct statement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to not include Israel in the quick selection list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
adds that the country code has now been added .
police sets tear gas &amp; rubber stories against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met with the police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reform for the public education system .
the police used tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led to the fact that the police used rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation over plans .
according to the suggestions of the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are implemented to save money .
some of the protest participants were gra@@ ffi@@ ti@@ ts against the provisional president , Michel Tim@@ er , spra@@ ying on walls .
the recent protests occurred several days after demonstr@@ ators went into the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dismissed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the exchange rate between Moscow and Teher@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the year @-@ on @-@ year comparison .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , interest on the part of Russian companies in the country grew strongly , the ambassador communicated with them .
Russian companies are taking on existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the exchange rate between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and was $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade recovery has been achieved by supplying machines , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan is a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
last year , the Russian Foreign Agency issued some 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , first of all Reise@@ vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran has reached the top 20 countries where the number of tourists in Russia is concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia are broken off last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , relatively few Russians are visiting Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes it will change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I personally can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
seeking witnesses : beverage market inf@@ ested in forest br@@ ushing oil
a rob@@ ber@@ y event has been practi@@ sed on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the au@@ spices of a fire@@ arm , three dark @-@ cla@@ d people , who had m@@ um@@ med their faces , asked the staff of the beverage market to hand out cash and then fled at first on foot and then probably with a silver @-@ colored VW @-@ Golf .
the police did not share how much money was captured .
the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters , so relatively small .
the beverage market can be accessed directly from the park deck of the Re@@ we market and can be viewed badly .
after the raid , the perpetr@@ ators must be sc@@ anned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and from the gravel parking space located in front of the car park entrance with the silver @-@ colored car , possibly in direction B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who have made observations at the time of the crime ( against 19.@@ 45 o &apos;clock ) who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y should urgently report to the police .
Nag@@ old : play and fun during summer@@ time
eight beautiful and happy days the children and young people of the social pedago@@ gical day group / social group work of the child@@ care association Nag@@ old spent their summer vac@@ ations in Nuss@@ dorf near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
the life @-@ joyful group was lod@@ ged in the secluded leisure centre of Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ ven during the first school holiday week .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand we went to B@@ rette with the visit to the string zoo .
to the other , to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guidance in the world @-@ famous monastery .
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about the daily life and food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days , the group enjoyed themselves in the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited to jump , swim and sp@@ lash .
culinary children and supervis@@ ors were treated with their own meals like the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese .
in workshops , be@@ ati@@ fied , beautiful pieces of jewellery made of pearls and stones were created or made of wood a Roman @-@ mill @-@ game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other highlights of leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bun@@ te evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the day of their journey home the sun and the children and young people returned home satisfied .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : the Gateway of Mer@@ cy
the mini@@ stran@@ ts from the soul care unit Ey@@ ein@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , St. Anna , were on their way to Freiburg on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
four stages were dealt with together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to bridge the time to the next Rom@@ atic pilgrimage of all the ministers in the next two years , the St. Anna &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minist@@ erial Round &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgri@@ m hike . &quot; &quot; &quot;
various pilgrimage destinations have been tested and finally decided for the bishop &apos;s city of Freiburg , where during this year &apos;s Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgri@@ m &apos;s goal was offered during the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy .
16 Min@@ is from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ene , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt , arose .
in the evening before , Pastor Stor@@ k sent pilgrims to St. Anna in a small celebration , blessed the pilgrims &apos; crosses and distributed the Pil@@ gri@@ ms &apos; blessing .
von Hor@@ b was driven by train to the starting point of Vil@@ lingen , where also a Münster Our Lady stands and so the Pil@@ gri@@ m &apos;s way from Münster was started .
the individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening by a short impulse with various prayers , songs and texts .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is repeat@@ ed@@ ely made re@@ ast of field crosses , chap@@ els or churches to sing a song from specially produced pilgrims booklet .
the local par@@ ishes of the local par@@ ishes were also available for the overnight stays .
Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller made a delicious and hearty dinner and breakfast at the stage destinations .
on the second day we passed Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
the next step was to take the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , but had to climb around 500 metres in altitude and climbed again afterwards .
in the evening , the deserved reward was a common barbecue at the bathroom .
after the morning impulse on the 4th day of pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter we went to the final stage to Freiburg .
visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , the Min@@ is met in the Freiburg Min@@ ster later in the afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy .
with a little impulse , God was given thanks .
the min@@ is by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t were welcomed at the evening mass in Münster .
after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the Brei@@ s@@ gau@@ metropolis .
in the afternoon we went by train back to Hor@@ b .
at the end all the participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped .
fleet Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ med home as Br@@ ite Gold won for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ zed last night in the men &apos;s team Sprint in Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 year old from Glasgow took the anch@@ or@@ age , which his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made his own . the J@@ uss@@ i proudly made the legend when he stor@@ med home to win a victory from the favour@@ ites of New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after catching a modest sixth place in the London rail world championships in spite of Ho@@ ys &apos;s withdrawal .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as an execution .
Gary &apos;s retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed , when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots , which has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y winning - and Sk@@ inner prevailed in the qualifying rounds of an olymp@@ ic board , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his lap , however , Kenn@@ y pushed the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation , driving in a higher gear in order to slow it down and enable Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as a BBC expert and dropped Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they climbed the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for myself .
we set up an olymp@@ ic record in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 on the site Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ der admitted that after a weak start he deliberately dropped on the track .
he with@@ drew this statement later and there was no objection of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
this time there was no such problem with such an outstanding victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole GB flags on the tri@@ b@@ une like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we came together in the last three months as a team .
with so many world titles we have come so badly that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which has won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London .
if that is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the past five months , we expect successful five days in the velo@@ drome .
with the form of Kenn@@ y it is possible to repeat Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
this would be for Kenn@@ y - exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be the same from Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y is next in the Sprint , which starts today and will go for three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Whe@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometer race .
they arrived at the finish in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record won in London in 2012 was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held today on the second day of the competition where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
he had argued in front of the qualification yesterday with representatives when officials called him to measure his height .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued and finished tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ el S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ ga@@ vie in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team relies on its strong track cycling team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to bring a crowd of med@@ als .
after a truly extraordinary portra@@ yal of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
Dra@@ mas played in the background , thus the res@@ ignation of Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s technical director in April in the midst of S@@ esto and M@@ ob@@ b@@ ing@@ vor@@ schau@@ fers as well as the retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks as if the legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which reached its peak at the perfect moment , could be repeated again .
future of melt @-@ melt from Port@@ land is question@@ able due to the lifting of the energy contract
the future of the aluminium mel@@ ts of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake , as the plant operator announces the energy supply contract , thereby raising all supply contracts , as the supply company supplies .
this step was followed by the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to plant the plant .
a grant that is set for 20 years will exp@@ ire in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk during closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effect because the melt @-@ melt consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry melt , which last year led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power@@ plant .
the melting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land is losing money and ris@@ king a closure .
this step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminum melt with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners will termin@@ ate their contracts .
the plant is in the majority ownership of a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller portions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity by enam@@ el , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L also stated that the treaties should be so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should have come into effect from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on the revenue on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L announced that the value of the contracts had already been depreci@@ ated in his annual subscription in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expecting a cancellation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa agreed that the decision to book the contracts was the ability to operate the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ co@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability ... to operate the melt or to ensure the supply of the melt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said that it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang in 2010 , which would have come into effect from November this year , even if it is still an explanation of why it has res@@ igned from the contract .
due to the poor economic conditions of the industry , analysts warn of the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt @-@ melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near New@@ castle .
in reference to the Analy@@ st &apos;s statements at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations said Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen that Port@@ land annually consume around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and tomato around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity .
should both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generating set it wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September edition of Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September edition of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and running on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of the cover followed a bizarre ( or just keeping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans ) , mirr@@ ored reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner family ( except the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the well @-@ loved Show@@ bi@@ z @-@ uncle and producers of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) .
this is the c@@ lich@@ é of almost every episode episode of a child &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity .
with regard to the September edition of Vo@@ gue , surely a new era of car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has begun .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim will have struck her as far as the Vo@@ gue cover is concerned ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to see in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September edition is the most sold issue of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference that resembles an illustrated book rather than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of advertis@@ ers ( Acc@@ ording to the 8@@ 32 pages of the tome 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the revelation of his cover @-@ star is eag@@ erly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine have been filtered through before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties that mo@@ m &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar @-@ Award winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
but even with the little chance that Mrs Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the earlier category , she is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to celeb@@ ri@@ ties or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if everything is applicable to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are truly talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , was one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers &apos; success is not pleasing to everyone .
with her reality TV story J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world was always ten@@ se .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed them and called them &quot; the mi@@ st@@ let@@ tes of the moment . &quot;
these feelings boiled down again when the news came out with the appearance J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but on the disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September edition of Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she is running for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ ming of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her made pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is in reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
congreg@@ ational centres have 160@@ ,000 people each year
more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s relief operations are rejected annually by the local councils , while the sector faces the effects of further mid @-@ cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly elderly , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for unfair del@@ o@@ cul@@ ations and similar - are rejected for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which have already been util@@ ised exc@@ essively , are ready for further cuts .
as of June next year , it is planned that these legal centres will lose further 30 percent of their federal funds .
the Director of the Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l &apos;s Local Government Centr@@ es said that the last survey of the National Federation of Local Institu@@ tions revealed that thousands of people have already been rejected every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only be worse without repe@@ aling the resolution of the Federal Government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s congreg@@ ational centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means that thousands of people are rejected by important services that you need , &quot; he said .
people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ a@@ geable and oppres@@ sive debts , families that have been dischar@@ ged by separ@@ ations , workers who have been un@@ ju@@ stly dismissed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need .
as of June 2017 , the Federal Government will cut resources by 30 percent , which means that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call on the General Prosecutor and Minister of Justice and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately lift these mid @-@ cuts , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for guidance on the national average .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community centres and their customer communities and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump Candi@@ date indic@@ ted after employees allegedly pulled fire@@ arms
new York : Donald Tr@@ ump campaign was indic@@ ted for alleged in@@ activity after it was announced that their campaign manager for North Carolina put a gun on one employee in February , while they were traveling in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment , filed on Wednesday in the State Court of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i gave up for months to have been waiting for the issue to be resolved internally before realizing that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulled a gun , put his right hand finger on the trigger , and ra@@ mm@@ ed the barrel in Vinc@@ ent Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave B@@ ordin@@ i in his accus@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
having compla@@ ined in the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i noted that at least four more persons had had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he stated in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i stated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indi@@ ct@@ ment only comes two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate dis@@ b@@ anded as he told a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - gun@@ men and weapons friends - should take action if its rival H@@ illary Clinton was elected and judge should appoint .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign &apos;s campaign made it clear that the media would have torn his words out of context and that he would not commit to violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ ordin@@ i &apos;s complaint demands compensation from the campaign for breach of due diligence and Philip due to bodily injury and permanent emotional damage .
the press spokesperson &quot; Hope Hi@@ cks &quot; could not be reached for a comment .
attempts to contact Philip were also out of place .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer an employee of the campaign .
responding to calls from his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , was not re@@ acted .
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has so far led a controversial campaign .
the procedure is B@@ ordin@@ i by Donald J. Tr@@ ump For President Inc . , 16 @-@ CS @-@ 14@@ 300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) .
Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before World Ele@@ ctions : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) considerable losses for the SPD and CD@@ U government parties are distinguished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this resulted in representative surveys from the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to go@@ vern in the North , this is not possible after the survey figures in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in both federal states , the SPD , however , would be the strongest party and would have a good chance of remaining the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD pl@@ ung@@ ed from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party only sm@@ iled short of the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is cont@@ ested between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left came to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the country parliament .
despite slight losses , the Green Party returned to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag despite slight losses of 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) .
with 3 per cent , N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented on the Land@@ tag .
according to the poll@@ s in Berlin , the poll@@ s were only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
it thus still la@@ gged behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but on the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented at 14 percent for the first time in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , while the pirates would not miss the move in 2011 .
Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and internet in slow motion : the Nokia communic@@ ator was launched 20 years ago .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - his producer experienced a disaster .
the tool weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thi@@ cker and bigger , therefore it was not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was rather cl@@ ums@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory was at the beginning eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , which would be enough for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to business exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few Euro , lovers can buy the devices on the Internet , but they somehow come from the stone age of the internet age .
20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer trade fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as an &quot; office in the west pocket format . &quot;
indeed , the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot for then standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax was the communic@@ ator .
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , albeit slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then we found a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white @-@ screen .
the price was quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , ie about 1400 euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 Euro in 2015 .
in August 1996 , no one could suspect that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything has changed .
smart phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s &apos; cell phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold to Microsoft and wound up .
today , the market is dominated by providers who came all a lot later than Nokia .
being online always and everywhere is everyday life for a lot of people .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
around 1.4 billion devices were sold , and 5@@ 55 million units were sold on Samsung and Apple .
worldwide sales of the units are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
a whole industry has been created around the smartphone in the meantime .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , then Apple CEO Steve Jobs on Mac @-@ World announced the introduction of the iPhone .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an Internet communic@@ ator , all via touch screen easy to use .
Apple &apos;s triumph@@ al march began , and today the iPhone is the Group &apos;s most important product .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had a look at it .
she finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
today every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all need to learn to get the smartphone out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of the Siemens Executive Board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the meantime , permanent availability is considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will not only bring renewal and prosperity in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me this was the biggest attraction He@@ ath@@ row , just as in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities we will already create 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips , create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding He@@ ath@@ row is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ aming on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong even at He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcoming , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question asked .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
enlargement is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 bn in wit@@ ch@@ ly growth and leave a legacy of skills and jobs in both the airport and the whole of the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , who has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - the five years as a result of the world &apos;s best airport terminal , to the T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the two most frequ@@ ented bridges of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
London &apos;s 2012 games were a great success for GB and I am confident that He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to steer this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment , which England can be proud of .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ atz @-@ und Maus@@ spiel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding ad blocking . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to circum@@ vent ad block@@ age , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertisements on its desktop site , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to again block advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop site would change the coding with regard to its advertisements to make it difficult for indicating the recognition of which part of the page advertisement .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to circum@@ vent the new codes .
in a blog post , Ad@@ block Ben Williams , spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams , wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her fight between the upcoming open source community and the b@@ yp@@ assing has been underway since the invention of advertis@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicator lights have become for the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a study of the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people worldwide use display lock@@ ers ; almost four times as much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion active users who access Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertis@@ ment accounts for 84 percent of the advertising impact of fac@@ ebook computers .
the company has placed it on desktop PCs on desktop PCs , since mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for social networking and Inst@@ agra@@ m , a spokes@@ man told them .
advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of revenue , so Facebook appears to be worthwhile investing in such a step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ad Pre@@ ferences &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tool to get people more control over them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook said that Ad@@ blocks would be wor@@ rying about new filters because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a positive experience for the users , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook spokes@@ man in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a mu@@ te means , which is why we focused instead on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences in order to put more control into the hands of people .
wife with presum@@ ed suicide on Swiss highway crossing
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call on witnesses , after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday was convic@@ ted of a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
a woman lay in the dark &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss woman , at the age of 49 , who was attacked by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she died still on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , said the police , calling them and every witness of the incident to report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investig@@ ative procedure was opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter shared the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something that the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers will not be held responsible .
in each of the two cases - where a person was walking in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian is running in the middle of the night on the highway as it was in the newspaper .
last year a police officer was acqu@@ itted of neg@@ ligent kill@@ ings after having passed and killed a man who was in August 2014 of a night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and was unconscious in the street , and took judgment .
the court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- ran into a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; the judge said .
anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once hab@@ itable
according to the projections of a new NASA climate model Venus was probably once hab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus by using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have her@@ d@@ ded similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously suggested that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and nevertheless slowly spread .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of early Venus .
the planet probably had more dry areas than Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to house life and protected from rapid evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS simulation model simulation the slow rotation of Venus is exposed to its daylight for almost two months , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than that of the earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution that was previously suspected by planet researchers .
although it was presumably inhab@@ itable , the Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light over several billion years .
their oceans evapor@@ ated and their steam was burnt away by ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro @-@ gen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect - the Venus , which we know today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy coming back as trainer of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy res@@ igned on Thursday as Trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to low co@@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
as an alternative president / general manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately seek a new trainer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a comment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of the summer , I thought about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , that it requires and to bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the Vision of the Trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations needs to be perfectly matched to that of the organisation .
it must also have a right to co @-@ ordin@@ ate decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organisation and wish him only the best for the future .
during his debut season Roy was awarded the best trainer of the League during his debut season 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
he brought the club to 112 points and at the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed in each of the last years the post season .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card Spot in the Western Conference to score five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy had four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadi@@ ens and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
Nordic workers resume negotiations again , put on strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour disputes relating to the pay for North Sea oil workers are suspended , while all the parties &apos; parties sit down for a new round of talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil @-@ field service provider Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of processing the present dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold several full @-@ day sessions in the coming weeks , which will start in the beginning of next year to address the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has cut rates to its counter@@ contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s rat@@ chet reduction follows a 10 percent decline for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said additional cuts will give the company the needed space to get through the market down@@ turn .
shell has released thousands of people and plans to abandon its oil and gas business operations in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure due to the lower crude oil prices , an economic situation which was reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish parliament , Dave Anderson , met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that have taken place in the North Sea for a generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and across the country , we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion of spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected to be around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rot@@ ational rate of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates beneath the stars of the P@@ lei@@ ades star hotel .
the new data help the astronom@@ ers understand why stars are rotating at different rates in the star @-@ pile as well as in what connection the rot@@ ational periods are with the planet formation .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star hotels , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies at 4@@ 45 light@@ years from the earth .
many stars of this star @-@ run , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
now they turn fastest .
at peak @-@ rotation rates , these ri@@ pen@@ ing stars em@@ it large amounts of star @-@ win@@ ches .
as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star age , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of any star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a visible star spot -- such as sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more solid stars turn slower than massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , making bigger stars slower Pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ballet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rotary rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lei@@ ades star cluster offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is still much ahead of us what we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base to Base .
after his emotional withdrawal announcement , the 41 year @-@ old pro will wear the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on 12 August against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say goodbye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; said the 14 @-@ times all @-@ star game participant in the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez became the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract gave him $ 27 million a year since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will serve as a consultant and youth coach in the future - with full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid back for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed some mil@@ estones .
with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys only two other bas@@ eball players show similar values in the main statistics .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should nevertheless not be accepted into the Hall of Gl@@ ory of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was so controversial his appearance outside the place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star admitted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 , banned ster@@ oids . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was locked up for 2@@ 11 games due to the involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal by the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered the main suspect to have received performance @-@ enhancing funds for years on an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a law@@ suit the lock was reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league could even have done me a favor for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said to be cute at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his farewell @-@ days are not very silent .
while many bas@@ eball legends have been playing the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and told the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress Kate Hudson , got sympathy @-@ expressions of fans from Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Arch@@ riv@@ alen Boston red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; sang the followers with the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team .
Olympics 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ i@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first dop@@ ing cases
catch : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , Wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ eber Adrian Ziel@@ inski is not allowed to start from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
an experienced athlete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become known to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter road@@ blocks in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and ruled out in Brazil - immediately before the onset of the already critically acclaimed athle@@ tics competitions this news is coming to an end .
in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de has been proven last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed its expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old finished fourth in the final over 100 m of butterfly , just 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have participated in the events above 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B @-@ test and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association assumes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and demands full cooperation in the investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history it is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio the news se@@ eps over the positive test at Dan@@ ik@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on with it even into the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Ath@@ le@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , the banned substance should be the EP@@ O blood dop@@ ing agent .
Dan@@ i@@ ova was suspended for the time being , according to B@@ NT the B @-@ sample should already be positive .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov immediately expressed criticism of the bul@@ letin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation are not allowed to participate in Rio .
on Friday the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days earlier on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon .
both pol@@ lu@@ te the intake , but both may not start in class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athletes , the Dan@@ ik@@ owa case is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the World Association IA@@ AF had banned the entire Russian squ@@ ad , except for systematic dop@@ ing , and also the parent nation of Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming sport , the former bre@@ aches in China also caused violent confron@@ tations between the athletes .
thus the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ lac . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium above 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also the focal point of an exploration of the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing fraud , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was tested positively by the Chinese championships in 2014 to the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but only had to leave a three month lock .
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ presses hack@@ ers their ran@@ som
program@@ mers of black@@ mail @-@ malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so .
according to a recent survey conducted by malware protection specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , among 540 businesses in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surv@@ eyed companies were at least once , partly multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software in the past twelve months .
in Germany , nearly 20 percent of the companies were already the target of ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som @-@ money required by the perpetr@@ ators to re @-@ use the challenged systems and data .
according to the reports of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize in terms of attacks in corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially resulting cancellation fee will be considerably higher than with private users .
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot;
in 2008 most of the painting programs were designed to send advertising .
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
only private users were the target , but the change to company att@@ un@@ ed in recent months was terri@@ fying fast .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once active on a victim &apos;s computer , it searches for recently changed files such as Word , Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
subsequently , the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
in order to get the end key code to the files , the victims must pay money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin - .
but where private users are the personal photo database on the game , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production stops .
the damage is correspon@@ d@@ ingly higher when a ran@@ som@@ ware hits .
22 per cent of the affected German companies reported loss of turnover through ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to inter@@ rupt the business operation , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t pay , you only support the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data again .
for managers , it is difficult to reject the perpetr@@ ator &apos;s claim in the face of stand@@ still in operation .
the hack@@ ers again know this and try to build up a good reputation .
in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure analyzed the user @-@ winning areas and contact with black@@ mail and came to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain to their victims via chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set free accessible support websites or de@@ code for free sample files .
and if private persons are rede@@ emed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies need to negotiate partly hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to return their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , hack@@ ers are becoming more and more professional and share the work , says Security Expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski of the anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware around within a week . &quot;
it is more likely that these are three or four persons .
the program@@ mers then sell their malware in the form of a software building kit to the actual black@@ mail@@ ers .
the so @-@ called malware kits have been created by buying malware , advice and tools for a one @-@ time , fixed price range between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; included is a custom@@ ization tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the black@@ mail@@ ers then seek further hack@@ ers to spread the newly bought software among the victims .
we live in a service industry .
so one logs in one of the forums on the ground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is made per infected computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the criminals instruc@@ t sp@@ amm@@ ers to spread , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
more than 50 percent of the company IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes pol@@ l trust to be able to rep@@ el Ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful exhaus@@ tion , the perpetr@@ ators are instead threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , the damage potential is much higher than before , depending on the type of data .
in the future , the perpetr@@ ators could also have completely new targets on the internet of things in the future .
at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz , Def@@ con , safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpetr@@ ators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 .

sounds pretty over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V seems rather small , the passengers have plenty of room in the first row and in the rear , it doesn &apos;t work tight at any point .
the interior materials are well @-@ processed and have a pleasant effect , only the upper side of the cockpit will fall off .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles when it comes to storage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a luggage compartment of 4@@ 53 l for raised and 10@@ 26 l where folded backs are available , but there are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the back bench can be folded like Kin@@ o@@ essel and thus offer storage space , which is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to ceiling .
the boot can be loaded easily , but the charging height is slightly higher at 650 mm than in the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide revolutions .
however , he is likely to qui@@ eter his work a bit more quietly .
the average daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is enjoyable .
there is another mot@@ ori@@ zation : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the steering is likely to be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment in the top variant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the safety systems include the City emergency brake assist ( runs up to 32 ) , the collision warning system and lane keeping assist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the collision worker sometimes irrit@@ ates because he ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed controller responds to the traffic sign detection and th@@ rot@@ tles the speed when necessary .
but the full connectivity is only available for top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more .
two US@@ B@@ - and one HDMI bus@@ hing are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to achieve .
the 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the petrol engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines meet the Euro 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda is offering a versatile and everyday car .
airline is not liable : fall on passenger bridge
an airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that a liability was only possible in case of haz@@ ards that are typical of air traffic .
the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff had broken a kne@@ ec@@ ap in the fall .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline had to pay no compensation to the man .
case of illness : when does the organis@@ er pay
after their trip , sick leave will only get money back when the cause of the disease is doub@@ t@@ lessly found in the hotel .
but this is only the case if more than ten percent of guests have shown the same symptoms .
in the case of the trial , a family had suffered severe diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of its door@@ way .
she spent almost all of the vac@@ ations in the room .
their illness brought the vac@@ ation@@ ers back to a defective wastewater treatment plant , which allegedly polluted sea@@ water .
the family thought that the trip was so poor - and compla@@ ined against the organis@@ er .
before the court , the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs did not succeed .
although the sewage treatment plant was indeed defective .
but the organizer only learned about it shortly before the departure of the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs .
until then , he had to assume that the sea@@ water was al@@ right .
he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , so the verdict .
since no im@@ puri@@ ties were found in the samples of water .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by infection with one another - belongs to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were dise@@ ased .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said that after the violence done by refugees in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach in July many people would have worried about further attacks .
the state must be pru@@ dent and determined at the same time to react to terrorist acts .
certainly : our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and split .
we will not grant this triumph to the terrorists .
if criminals want to leave the country more quickly , however , the security and strength also increase the approval of the population for refugee policy .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve a realization of the proposals up to the Bundestag election in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced further personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a medium of four @-@ scale order over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the promotion of sympathy for terrorism must again be under punishment .
video surveillance needs to be improved , the ce@@ ase@@ fire will be am@@ ended in such a way that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is ham@@ pered .
after de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words , the most recently discussed duty of confidentiality for physicians should be maintained .
however , he wants to seek solutions in dialogue with the medical profession , how the endanger@@ ment of the citizens can be reduced , he said with regard to mental ab@@ norm@@ alities .
in order to counter the ra@@ dic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister regards a better social care .
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ zed people .
in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère plans the use of concealed investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD leader Gabriel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about anything that will help to improve security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior distinc@@ tly opposed action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a sla@@ p for the sni@@ pers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gabriel to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had previously rejected calls from the Union following a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double nationality .
he considers a general prohibition of full @-@ wear to be constitu@@ tionally problematic .
you can &apos;t forbi@@ d everything you reject , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses in court .
green boss Sim@@ one Peter accused the minister that he wanted to simulate crime and maneu@@ ver@@ ability with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terrorist par@@ c@@ els .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ wing leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; naval pro@@ verb@@ s and a tigh@@ tening of the right to stay bring people no more safety in this country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow at the motorway
it st@@ alls regularly on the circum@@ ference road - here a picture of November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this is to change : the right @-@ wing deposit is to be extended . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is good news for all car drivers who are driving in traffic on the ambient street every night in traffic jams when driving over the highway den Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between Hammer Street and Wes@@ eler Straße , the road construction extended 700 meters .
you can then drive directly from the Hammer Straße to the right .
the big advantage : traffic shares early on , thus improving the overall workflow on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder anno@@ ys the drivers especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the Back@@ sta@@ u goes up to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes also beyond .
the reason for this is the needle eye on the B 51 shortly before the departure of the Wes@@ eler Straße .
from here , traffic is guided only one lane via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built back in three @-@ quarters years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer possesses the necessary load capacity , in order to absorb mainly heavy @-@ duty traffic .
the responsible state company cannot say how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the connected factory traffic jam will last .
however , it has to be reck@@ oned with years : the bridge has an official remainder of its life by 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the rule of law , the state company deliberately chose the less traffic @-@ less time during the school holidays because it was to be expected with disabilities .
the traffic will be passed on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .
intercultural Travel : cultural Activities for Schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Das invisible Haus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; visited the theatre piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Das invisible Haus &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are now planning a music project .
the N@@ ima &apos;s association makes it possible for young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Young Theater Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the context of the &quot; intercultural journey &quot; initiated by N@@ ima &apos;s association , 19 students from 11 to 15 years visited the staging in the small house .
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project .
most of the boys in the class had come to Münster from September 2015 to March 2016 , among others , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria and spoke little German .
thanks to the choreography , the scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action nevertheless , thus the press release of the Young Theater Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg , and the Young Theater will work together within the framework of a music theatre project .
from October to December , adolescents with and without refugee and migration background should be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the areas of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theatrical language mediation are in the planning phase .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; continues .
in view of the increased number of refugees , the association comp@@ utes with many classes who want to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of weather
the weather has made the shooting star Gu@@ ck@@ ern a d@@ ash in the south @-@ west of Germany in the night to Friday - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain to observe the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we will surely see a lot of shooting stars in the sky .
the shooting stars are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which are one of the fastest shooting stars with 2@@ 16@@ ,000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us that rises in the Nor@@ theast .
rest@@ ful night : advice on sleeping disorders
in the evening , one rolls around etern@@ ally , at night , one is awake for hours , in the morning it is no longer to think about sleep well before the wake @-@ up ring .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than 10 percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleeping problems or sleep problems manifest ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and many causes can be attributed to them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , member of the board of the German Society for S@@ leep Therapy and S@@ leep Medicine .
what one understands for the time being , however , is the In@@ som@@ nia , that is , an in @-@ and @-@ sleep disorder .
just being able to sleep makes many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , board member of the German Medical Association with Practice in Lower Saxony , Var@@ el .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind this can be organic , mental or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also drugs .
not in@@ frequently is the sleep disorder expression of another condition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is often common in a depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Weber . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors op@@ press each other .
for example , if you have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , you can sleep well , wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to p@@ onder@@ ing about everyday problems and worries , then there is an example .
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and are affected by the day should go to the doctor , tell them .
the impairment can look quite different : you are de@@ pressed , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulty with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache .
to ease sleeping disorder , it is important to find out the causes .
the treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quired .
Dr. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Medical Center of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin , emphas@@ ises the low @-@ lying sleep physician in Germany .
that is why one should first contact the family doctor in case of sleep problems , he advises .
this can be clari@@ fied with investigations , whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep , and what happens ?
in order to study in the sleep lab , doctors advise , for example , in snor@@ ing with breathing drop@@ outs , in case of illness , sleep@@ wal@@ kers or if you do not find the cause of a dor@@ man@@ t disorder , Fi@@ etze explains .
you don &apos;t have to prepare yourself for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please do not make a nap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after ti@@ ling , one goes to bed at its normal time .
besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ go@@ g@@ gles , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger .
in addition , a camera draws the sleeping person on the ceiling .
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a few screw plugs on which you can apply for a better sleep .
they don &apos;t sleep on the day , do not watch TV for sleep , don &apos;t watch TV while sleeping , don &apos;t watch TV at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that &apos;s not condu@@ ci@@ ve to it at all .
what the jungle camp has to do with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has commented on Facebook for dis@@ ap@@ pointing out@@ cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he won gold for the first time at the World Championships in Doh@@ a , and at the same time set up his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ athlete Markus Dei@@ mmer has placed himself in front of his ex @-@ team@@ mates via Facebook .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € bonus and a jungle king 15@@ 0.000 € should not be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; said the 26 @-@ year @-@ old in the night to Friday on his Facebook page .
the transport system in the swimming sport is bad , the dop@@ ing controls , on the other hand , are very good .
this way we can &apos;t compete with countries that promote very much and do not look so closely at dop@@ ing or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to make a com@@ eback , Dei@@ zer would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; if you cannot take a certain amount of time before WM / OS by independent controllers from WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A , you must not participate , &quot; said the election ham@@ burger , who meanwhile runs an ice cream shop .
airport : gang of baggage tigh@@ tened
professional thi@@ eves at Dus@@ sel@@ dorf Airport
on Thursday , two women and two men aged 50 to 61 were arrested by the police of Düsseldorf police .
the susp@@ ects had committed several bags and luggage pil@@ es as a gang .
at 21.@@ 30 p.m. civilian officials in the area of the airport Düsseldorf recognised a gang that was known to the police of past theft deli@@ ri@@ ties .
since mid @-@ July this year , the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences and were involved in a collaborative , collaborative and particularly professional manner .
the specialists of the Criminal Inves@@ tig@@ ate 34 can demonstrate four acts to the thi@@ eves who had been specifically ind@@ ented for crimes against Germany .
in total , they carried over 15,000 Euros .
old buildings , a few lin@@ den trees , a rest of cob@@ ble@@ stones in between : the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not look like this at first sight , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if one goes along the road from east to west , one passes at play@@ grounds , a fres@@ her kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ aden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the facade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
compared to a Li@@ dl , which is to be demol@@ ished even soon , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments is to be built here by 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the competent real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , will be favor@@ ed by burning cars in recent weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rented contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin interior sen@@ ator Henkel has advoc@@ ated a tough action by the police against the project , called the area as &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
after clearing the premises on the ground floor , the Ka@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers , the police pat@@ rolling official statements for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three crew wag@@ ons on site , locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94 .
in the meantime , construction workers were renovated on behalf of the unknown house owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal , and one day later police and construction workers moved under the che@@ ers of sympath@@ isers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the street is peaceful : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk in the late night .
in the immediate vicinity of the building projects are a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
lef@@ tist violence is not the chief concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who raises three children here , are mainly anno@@ yed by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the building projects they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it doesn &apos;t sound like a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kie@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who wanted a majority of police protection from the left . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police put up between house owners and their neighbours , apparently does not exist .
Friedrichsha@@ in , in the east of Berlin , was actually a traditional workers &quot; quarter , which , even today , has a low average and has a high poverty risk compared to the rest of the city .
in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former East German Democratic Republic , including almost all the main@@ z street near the Riga .
while the Main@@ zer was cleared in a real street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people who occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the neighborhood has become increasingly popular for tourists and ball@@ ads from all over the world over the past few years .
this is reflected in the r@@ ents which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols for this development : they detect them from thrown discs or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which have been disc@@ arded with paint bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other street was mentioned this year as often as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason for not all of the neighbours to view this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily imp@@ acted by crime : crimes such as personal injury , according to statistics , are almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen .
the largest part of the criminal off@@ ences constitute material damage , which tend to hit the newly built and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer who has lived in a ten@@ ant house next to the disputed 94 for 17 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
as far as violence is concerned , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours , they are not destined to be .
even the famous burning cars are no longer available in the ri@@ gs .
for the architect , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here , one helps one another , lives together on the road and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has been deliberately drawn into the streets of Riga - and remained .
this is why it was so important that the residents get back their road : from the police , the politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the district .
but in the eyes of residents , as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street is still taken away : due to fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former buildings , which disp@@ lace the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , these are con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well used here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what do you want to do if someone never listen to someone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , including the police and the inhabitants .
for those who are anno@@ yed by color bombs , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
those who come here should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub neighborhood to complain badly about noise .
all persons presented only with first names have asked not to be called by their proper name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee commission@@ er
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner for integration and organisation .
she is also a social worker on site .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the Refu@@ gee Officer of Ur@@ bach since July .
the social pedago@@ gue supports the team of the administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group refugee aid , administration , authorities and anyone else interfer@@ ing with .
Reg@@ ine &apos;s client of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is there now , the aff@@ lu@@ ent Woll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau , which has a problem above all .
thus some - less ridi@@ cul@@ ed than on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job .
we were looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ term experience in the field of social work , just an en@@ during wool mil@@ k@@ sau .
but administration work is not a central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organization , work with people on site and behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been with us for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position on three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors .
there are big and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
new containers soon in Was@@ en@@ straße
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the municipalities are responsible for the connection provision .
they have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the costs of the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the commun@@ es themselves .
the responsibility changes from the Land@@ rats@@ amt to Commune and Job@@ centre .
problem : there are free objects but not every owner wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
in fact , the administration does not find any private apartments .
so far , it is not possible to rely on private apartments , such as Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common dwell@@ ings have to be in@@ timi@@ dated as it is so beautiful .
in other words , new containers will soon be set up in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , are Reg@@ ine &apos;s customers and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a firm place of residence , there are intern@@ ships , training centres , school places , one @-@ euro jobs and aid activities for refugees and migrants who need to be und@@ am@@ aged or furnished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more places would be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many work in the building yard or help house masters , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but work doesn &apos;t just mean work .
the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and the customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so it takes offers like sports , contacts with locals and above all language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so also here are administration and honorary posts .
it is central that the refugees feel that they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they need to explain to the refugees that it takes time and they can bridge the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses .
those who develop the feeling that he could not help anyone in Ur@@ bach would not be able to work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate .
the clear majority was motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the customer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who don &apos;t work at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and the customer is therefore always motivated to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all that is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : do the two have fear of ra@@ dic@@ alization after the latest occur@@ ren@@ ces , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine &apos;s client clearly says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some people may call nai@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also subject to the refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins will make them completely ob@@ s@@ essed .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so the main and honorary officials have to look for jobs in the region and in the region .
