<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer looked for a little variety with some colleagues with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden sport pyramide" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes the horses remembered their holidays, they hunted in the fast gallop home to the feeding troughs.</seg>
<seg id="7">A kilometer at this pace, I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," says Langer.</seg>
<seg id="9">And thus the riding career ended again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday Germany's best golfer ever was - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He had his family run over the system of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even look for photo purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and with it also with CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports crew handed over the gold sports pyramid to the man from Anhausen in the course of a small gala.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards for the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silberhorn laurel leaf, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen already blamed him.</seg>

<seg id="20">"" "" "" "this award means a lot to me," "" "says Langer," "" "because it is awarded not only for sporting achievements but also for social commitment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">For decades, Langer has been fostering young talent.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so he also received the prize money of 25,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "with 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US master winner was recorded on Saturday in the" "" "Hall of Fame des deutschen Sports" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">The winners include athletes of Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the runner Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthum the handball Erhard Wunderlich.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sportsmen came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and dumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">"" "" "" "investing in infrastructure and preventing TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="3">The two U.S. presidencies, however, are unaffiliated with the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question.</seg>
<seg id="4">The difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">That, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep this in doubt rather small and warns about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to control the economy and regulate death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, asserts Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will massively drive back regulations, and he is strongly committed to a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for businesses." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, it has disadvantaged chances to open up and needs money for it.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes for the rich would be increased, they say.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In order to be invested, Trump and Clinton speak almost word-like.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate sees the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the state-critical party wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So, there could be party-internal discussions on trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power stations and drive coal mining back in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, the Parisian climate protection agreement wants to cancel it.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly expand renewables and demand: "a country will create the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will be either China, Germany or America - I want we to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the trans-spades trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, however, both do not want to isolate the US from international trade - they simply want to better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should also be paid better, for example, ask Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a starvation wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to go up, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand, Trump is standing who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics point out that the budget deficit would only increase.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least the rich to demand that they pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are fowl.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich North in one of the few decentralized accommodations for single-winged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs made up the institution together with Pro Familia and Munich's Frauenhilfe.</seg>
<seg id="18">It has recently been officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>

<seg id="30">Those who believe that, as soon as they are in Germany, are mistaken, Bahr tells us.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here too, single women in refugee camps are often regarded as inferior and abused in the worst case.</seg>

<seg id="40">Even in Swabia alone fledged women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman for the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central Franconia, there are in some community accommodation floors or own houses only for single women and their children.</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "Russia and Turkey: an" "" "alliance of outsiders" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to proclaim an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I can't resist the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile was sleek and he hardly radiated heat, even for his restrained circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report a whole five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper wrote that Erdogan had behaved as if something bad happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">It seemed to me that his enthusiasm was rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But a sustainable coolness radiating by Putin showed that Russia's head of state had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory remarks: the downfall of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at the time was hot.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin denounced and accused Ankara of being in the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater because it was celebrated by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Building the veto again becomes difficult, if not impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media launched a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse that he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a cease-fire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan first of all needs all the friends he can get after he was removed from his office last month for a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shocked him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the State television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports were allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Veodemographic put it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes are long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious at the West as it considers its response to the attempted power transfer as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">The continued resentment on the snail pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin, which is keen to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara for claiming support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this splendid palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present one, as an analyst once described to me, "Alliance of outsiders": two countries that are violated and badly treated by the West and are now allied.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played its role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents have said at the press conference that they hadn't even striped the issue.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasise them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian fighter jet, it is certainly better that the two heads of states talk to each other at least again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin firing Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly relieved his staff of staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV was many years part of the tightest of confidence in Putin.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in a statement by the Kremlin it is said that without giving reasons, Putin has ordered" "" "the dismissal of Ivanovo from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been his deputy since 2012, was appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin's website it is said (in Russian) that he was later the Chief of Staff and Chief of Staff of the governing staff.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the government's most important task to support your work as head of state with respect to bills and controls to implement your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov asked Ivanov to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are smiling faces convincing?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mystical.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was long time one of the closest confidant Vladimir Putin and works like him for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As chief of staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff will withdraw at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the ridicule for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the result of a kind of power struggle here?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who once was praised as a potential president, would like to lead Russian environmental policy, met with great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin cited on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said: "it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, I could almost say - trusting jobs for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV adopted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was president of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted the most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term as Putin's third term in office violated the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another close-up ally, Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became President three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The project is expected to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the northern deck of the Queensland crossings with the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closures of the" "" "ceiling blower" "", "which are approaching each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 metric tons of concrete and 46 skive ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The project is expected to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown already paid a visit to the construction site and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensland crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnessing an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">A total of almost 79% of all the bridge decks lie in their place and the last section of the deck is given in Rosyth today for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "Michael Martin, project manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said:" "" "the first closure represents a significant milestone in each bridge project." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">With this fantastic project, the closure represents trend-setting high and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower on the north, we had to close the still existing gap in the north or country side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern road bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massively, since the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at a slope of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate as the tolerances on which the team worked were tiny - on each side they were just a few millimeters.</seg>
<seg id="20">Luckily everything went very well.</seg>

<seg id="7">Up to now, a provision is missing.</seg>

<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="13">"" "the problem, such as Bratmann:" "" "there is currently no agreement between the factions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU would like to make as few rules as possible to investors.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harder editions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Regardless of how viola, a tightening of the situation on the housing market persists.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the action concept is implemented, this will take care of additional tasks in the construction management.</seg>

<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program is not yet complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how to compensate for the loss of some 1300 favorable apartments, whose funding is going to expire over the next few years?</seg>

<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It's fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children don't go outside to play, but rather prefer spending their leisure time on screens has been depleted by many over the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go, it's about getting people out of the sofa and being more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the television, then on video games and finally to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs were created).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop culture phenomena, interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand fell somewhat in the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries has been postponed by the massive demand that the servers overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokemon which can be tracked with a GPS and once they have been found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured" can be captured.</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the delusion and jumped for the lookout for the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the United States, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the "average" person returns every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which pursues 35,000 users, recently announced that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of persecuted people who train every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it merely looks the raw data for improving performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns for health, people want to take "30 minutes of time" to "come from the sofa" and "to be active every day" hit deaf ears because many public messages to health are boring and come from people who look miserable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sport reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical exercise helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead you here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderfull thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Three pillars of health are thus covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships during the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also deadly game spoils, which always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk around a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should I do?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they did not give us a reason to do sport as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will be decreasing over time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because of Poker's success, however, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="13">Billet is the fourth heterosexual American woman who wins a multi-competition title and the fifth, while she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation, or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears as her end result was shown and her long journey at that moment ended.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles won the last three years of her sport, 15 world championship medals, including 10 gold medals, including 10 gold medals, including 10 gold medals, including a mix of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou rescuon told her that she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It awaited her last examination in Brazil, a competition which did not go so much between the balance and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be regarded as disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in each of the women's workshops at the 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>

<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a little child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school excursion into the gymnasium in which Boorman trained, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, it hasn't lost any additional competition, a series of victories that will last as long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though Mustafina was slightly led by two turns, the picture shook.</seg>

<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her gently as she waited for her closeness - a pure formality - and tears poured into fine shiny red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collection book became a reality.</seg>

<seg id="10">The river Comite near Baton Rouges and the River Amite near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, will probably reach record levels over the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="11">The metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also said that a downstream flooding in Ascension Parish is a danger, as these flows only slowly over the assigned rivers into Lake Maurepas.</seg>

<seg id="25">Krautmann said that the rain has been completely absorbed by the rainfall since Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="26">The authorities indicated that heavy rainfalls and flooding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and the loss of instruction in five boroughs.</seg>

<seg id="32">In the town of Hammond, the municipality of Tangipahoa, almost two dozens of roads were closed because of the flood, and sand bags were provided for the residents to take part, hoping to keep the water out of their homes and shops.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "the last major flood we had was in March," "" "said Lacy Landrum from the city administration." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That's what I set up at the women's Olympic team in the Turns and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA have never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who were inspiring for many young girls of other skin colors.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess is and Madison Kocian, the Catholics, rounds off, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the United States.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic-female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America acclaimed.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they provided unexpected but masterful gymnastic routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual competition event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but we do not see gymnastic classes all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all hit the same way as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "" "because the next Olympic team will have only four female gymnasts in the team. besides, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and Turner is primarily in private sports clubs that are maintained by parents who pay for training, training, travel, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnens and families). the list can be continued as you like.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these trainers are in prosperous suburbs to support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs the gymnasts get their entire training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained their athletes since they started with the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to give the churches a countless, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and easy-to-use gymnastic.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my sports foundation for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">In my events we offered free and affordable gymnastic in Harlem for over 15,000 urban teens (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastic, which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration for this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of 'Girl Power' by the Holen of the Olympic clubteam and thank you for letting so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way, healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman was removed from office last year due to the dismissal of a government report</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities knowingly ignored, like a devastating government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and town councils to have ignored proof of electoral abuse due to" "" "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The former minister of integration and local government, who is now an anti-corruption manoeuvre, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off shut-off tapes outside of electoral cabins to protect intimidated voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should take a card to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">At present, a voter has to name only his name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes removing non-removable ink on a person's finger when they hand off their voting voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whistleblowers should receive more protection, says Sir Eric.</seg>

<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets election skandals in the east of London.</seg>

<seg id="18">In particular, he voiced alarm on the fraudulent letter of letters - when senior members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, mapped, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including conducting alignment to prove the identity</seg>
<seg id="20">In his report it says: "as proof, pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exerted, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the older, in particular communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveler Ian Wright chabts his tongue to the dirtiest places in Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveler undertook his immune system and prostrate of a serious test by leaking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting locations in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shook his course on a euro note, a banister at Piccadilly Circus, a flush button of a train toilet, as well as a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before landing any object, he used a luminometer to show himself and to show us what he is going to get involved in.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought of leaking the flush button of a train toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left behind him, more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his bowels by travelling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public balustrades to railway stations to rinsing buttongs of toilets, the task was definitively tested by his immune system</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the film he said:" "" "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and mud water." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he justified his reputation in any case.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he rejected was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His sample line showed a luminometry number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison to this, the luminometry number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to lick after her luminova figure was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "that comes close to the worst thing I got into a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing worse than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I won't lick anything here because it is disgusting inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune systems.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Valios Senior Venice president for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "" "we really wanted to offer consumers something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating for watching and at the same time explaining the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We conducted mad brainstorming that ended up saying that we said "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put it in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added:" "" "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he checked some of the things I told him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick her and others where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of all respondents reported lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of the stomach and intestine and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products containing enclosed lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their deeds had to be horrible for their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have provided us with the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message conveys that anti-social behavior will not be tolerated.</seg>

<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they have understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021, the country's election will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">After all, it's not stupid as yet: summer holidays, heat and landday balm struggle - that bites.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are supposed to be convinced by the election champions, are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the holidaymakers who are in the country, on the way to Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not locals, so do not choose the land day.</seg>
<seg id="8">Practical problems come here: during the holidays helpers who hang posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and end up votes will only work hard.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election day and the last day of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign close to the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.</seg>
<seg id="13">It will be exciting, how strong newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition agreement.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost inconspicuous electoral campaign, one sees from his big posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the country, distributes roses and chatting a little with the people, just as his legendary eloquent predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.</seg>

<seg id="18">The CDU with its peak channel data, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to make election campaign at the wrong time at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited Angela Merkel twice as Chancellor Angela Merkel to make her big news; the German Chancellor Angela Merkel is located in the north-east.</seg>

<seg id="21">"" "" "" "there was probably the majority from other federal states," "" "said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in the NDR." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's too bad to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.</seg>
<seg id="23">Apart from that, the Northeast-CDU largely waives the usual campaign conditions on marketplaces and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "that," "" "says Kokert, plays only a" "" "subordinate role." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "the Union has also noticed that in the country, it is clear that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again." ""</seg>

<seg id="27">The Council of the CDU campaigner Kokert to his fellow campaigners is also self-revealing: "you must go where it hurts, namely where people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party has to be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because there is a lot on the game, Sellering has now called his SPD into a particularly committed election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys, the Socialists and Democrats lay at least 22 percent behind the CDU (25) and just ahead of the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the election of 2011, the SPD won still clearly with 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>

<seg id="2">At the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "" "" "they've done everything pretty flickering," "" "says Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet petrol station." ""</seg>

<seg id="8">The award is also commended to those responsible for the construction work, such as when it comes to furnishing of emergency drives.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site was moved to the south on Monday and also the lock of the asphalt road in Ofterdingen has been lifted and so the connection to Rottenburg has been restored, the traffic situation within the village has relaxed.</seg>

<seg id="11">The passing through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "there have been some considerable complaints," "" "said deputy prime minister, Florian King, responsible for the transport management of the rehabilitation." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachstraße, Steinlachstrasse, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many Schleichstraße sought and preferred their Navi as the signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks were frantically sealed in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the speed limits were not complied with, the municipality called for the exhibition vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable overrides," says King, who himself made himself informed about the situation himself.</seg>

<seg id="19">Since the construction site has been moved, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businessmen at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is now open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 rehabilitation has led to revenue brooks allows everyone to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "those who have less to do with the" "" "end customer" "", "i.e. produced for other companies, have hardly any consequences for them." ""</seg>

<seg id="26">The most hit are the bars along the road.</seg>

<seg id="28">This is already existential threat.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "not only him, but all the restaurants have" "" "hit hard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.</seg>

<seg id="33">"" "the road refurbishment took its operation" "" "back two years ago." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Half of his staff have had to release him.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, President of the government has given Jörg Schmidt on a request by Göhner whether there could be a financial compensation, with the advice that the restaurant profit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties, where it was handled more generously.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been settled here since 1715, and refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">He can understand that other regulars are seeing less frequently because of complicated traffic management.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't go down, it is also somewhere else beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubts that his pedigree will come back after the refurbishment work has ended.</seg>
<seg id="43">In spite of the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göhner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on his clientele for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long-standing history.</seg>

<seg id="24">Some people are still uneducated and leave questions unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="25">And with some points - in the unequal treatment of patient for example - the question arises: what does it really have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the themes of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be argued that the assassins of Ansbach and Wuerzburg were refugees.</seg>

<seg id="2">In spite of diesel prices, delivery volumes are increasing worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="3">But not all markets are running smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="4">There is confusion around a term in the recall action.</seg>
<seg id="5">Volkswagen starts cautiously in shipments to the second half of the year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Despite the diesel affaires, Europe's biggest car manufacturer can continue to show a plus in spite of the diesel prices, thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in July, Volkswagen's core brand was weakening mainly in Western Europe and thereby adversely affected the total sales, as the company quoted in the Dax.</seg>
<seg id="8">In July, the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles in July with 449100 cars than in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="9">In Western Europe alone, China was the second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous year's level.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the home market of Germany the deliveries fell by almost a sixth.</seg>
<seg id="11">Jürgen Stackmann, head of sales, led the weaker figures from July, especially at two sales days less in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "in addition, there has been a reluctance to buy back in some core markets due to" "" "changed economic conditions" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote on the exit from the EU also stressed that a spokeswoman explained.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the United States, where the exhaust gases first escalated, a minus is also available.</seg>
<seg id="15">Big support for VW is the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="16">All in all, the primarily affected house brand of the Lower Saxony was further off lightly by the diesel scandal: after the first seven months only a delivery minus of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is available.</seg>
<seg id="17">Group sales director Fred Kappler was able to advance a sales increase from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time, 5,904 million worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had manipulated emission tests with a software.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany alone, VW is calling around 2.5 million vehicles for retrofitting into the workshops.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the course of the retrofitting VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects.</seg>
<seg id="22">After the conversion of the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "after the changeover, the car manufacturer establishes a" "" "guaranteed certificate" "" "certificate, but I do not speak of a" "" "guarantee" "" "as it was called on Friday in company circles." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Reason for this is juridical intricacies.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "the" "" "Focus" "" "had reported that Volkswagen now provided its German customers with a guarantee of scaffolding diesel models." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">This would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.</seg>

<seg id="29">"" "" "" "deviations from these will not be accepted," "" "said Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the ministry." ""</seg>

<seg id="31">"" "Volkswagen self uses the term" "" "guarantee" "" "but not as it was said in company circles." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination records: who actually buys vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle-aged people love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you go to the comment section, to cut it under the pseudonym Non-Alleviation men's middle-aged with harsh insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the re-emergence of records is not attributable to a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to mid-life nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight at the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hormone by hobby collectors - it has an emotional impact: older record buyers tend to retain their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog was a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the midst of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit and wildly dressed, before I stop, hold my hands and say something menacing like: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent salesmen were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I received from Sister Ray (Number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (number of data: eight middle-aged men, a woman, presumably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I guess," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have approx. 3,000 or 4,000 slabs.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and bought again items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60s early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things in which I was probably a bit too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and would like to spend time alone, and add: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers who meet him apply to the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pe, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the talks I have conducted, people usually get rid of their collection by 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers joined the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of trusted record covers, from items that awaken happy youth memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possessing material possessions as a kind of comfort," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is my collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to mentally employ yourself.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "inspires a worker from a plate stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month have not listened to them yet.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% possessed a record player they never used, while 7% of those who buy a record don't own a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried as I scroll through a pile of Bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (number of data: three middle-aged men) has noticed a "trophies aspect" of the revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came here just recently and said," I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead LP, so that I can put it on the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product-laden, less musically.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say," "" "I don't have a record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones who come in slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records, has a blower audience when I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned stores - Wild Beasts of latest synthesize and sex- packed pop instead of experimental jazz from the speakers - it's good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but psychic traumas are hard to determine if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the store for a few minutes and considers the variety of records to be sold.</seg>
<seg id="49">It makes a window-stroll rather than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">She doesn't deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is... "she is driving with a loving sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of fans: urban oufitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I am pretending to smuggle the jeans pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who are grouping themselves around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Crosley turntable.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items will mean more money for the industry and some customers could send into the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research has shown that the results of YouGov are correct, they are unaccounted for, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday mornings with security not strolling through record shops of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates as they avoid the staring look of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter who raises no middle-aged men's shoulders.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary transactions where individuals within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to Energydrinks, sell, provide hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and that a fire and sanity risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 temporary business, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were "absolutely trackable."</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely feeding people living in extremely precarious conditions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places threatened by the tearing was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is usually operated and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170.000 people signed the petition to keep the kids' café.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive achievement of Great Britain at 7-7 Rugby came to an abrupt halt in the final hurdle in the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they hit the deodoro stage here in Rio with a result of 43-7.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji shared a master class in handling, side steppe, back, line run and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was lost due to the not too bad consolation price of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day, could fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But independently of this Fiji would have beaten a 15-man-team in top form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least one Briton tomorrow will have a gold medal to hang around his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, former head of England in Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, Ryan lost any game at Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they only lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This slag will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji mysteriously began to bounce GBs from fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. to run into driving buses. the World Series Winner went up 5-0 up when Osea Kolinisau moved in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right-hand corner.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">An ugly Tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, jasa Veremalova scored a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new beginning, and there was still more than a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou pressured through further weak Tactics of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a goal.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB still learning.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced basic changes to the half-time and closed the fijian gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova passed through a brilliant interplay by Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went off for a long time in favor of the South Seeinsulans, whose fans sang, flags and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The fiff heard, the Fijis hugged themselves and GB kicked crushing down in the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day Fiji Japan defeated in the semi-final with 20-5 and Britain urged South Africa in a tight semi-finals match from the race - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a door among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no erotic gold than with these games and that will mean something.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first strokes to the last, 220 hard Hieve that go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">The echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was all present when they rowed to the second Olympic gold in a row without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sports, who laid a scale on such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, after all, their 39th disobedience, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant female athletes who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the nature of the triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in the rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to incremental advances that make the difference and no one was more instrumental than the coach who did not know 30 months ago whether he would survive this day as cancer was diagnosed with him.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer that is operable and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes slightly the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if that was the right term in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was hospitalized and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">That's how it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing itself is a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of the victory their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a moralizing morning doing something more than usual and trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "I was an emotional wreck this week. that's maybe a bit extreme, but it means so much." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It only repeats how much this means, how much I and Helen and Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him. he is the best trainer in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have wished for a better person to train or better coach.</seg>

<seg id="4">A small Frankish drinking water-purpose association as a model for the large water producers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Some time ago, it was in the original on a contribution by the Bayerischer Rundfunk.</seg>
<seg id="6">Little later, the water forum of the government of Lower Franconia rejected the purpose.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "the work of the Veitenstein group is" "" "Bavarian far as exemplary." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="8">Behind all this is Rupert Göller, who was 31 years in the German Zweckverband colleague, 28 years as managing director.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drinking water management association of the Veitenstein Group, based in Kottendorf, municipality Breitbrunn, annually supports about 150,000 cubic metres of water and supplies 32 locations and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">Member municipalities are the municipalities Kirchlouder, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are water supply contracts for other towns and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairwoman, Breitbrunn mayoral Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was appointed a water keeper in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the German Association in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"his tasks have been very diverse and they range from water management and maintenance work through office and organisation activities, budgeting planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends," said the president.</seg>
<seg id="15">As outstanding events she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain (1994), land purchases in the area of the new fountain (1998) and compensation of farmers, the renovation of the high container (1999), the repurchase of a central computer control (2004) and the rebuilding of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was no stalemate and there was always new improvements because water is debiting and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her speech she praised Göllers loyal, reliable and correct service over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has used a lot of heart blood for his water-purpose association and he has governed the water-purpose association as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a true practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitensteingruppe as a nitrate cut in front of the water forum of the Lower Franconia district.</seg>
<seg id="20">For this he received a lot of recognition and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller, for his part, praised Alfons Griebel who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best water keeper and he was a faithful knack.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">As highlights from his point of view, he described the well construction and the restructuring of the Zweckverband.</seg>
<seg id="25">The biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the rupture of the blast furnace at Kirchlouder on a 3rd of January.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here we had to work all night at minus 17 degrees, so that the villages could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">Also the supply of Neubrunn can only be maintained, because one filled the high container of Pettstadt with hoses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The management of the drinking water management association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - light vision for the German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-packed and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared from additional costs in millions of millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that the industry threatened from green-green promotion are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">The German Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), said the "West German Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ), said that it remains with the release of the Renewable Energy Umbrella in the German steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "I am really glad that we could finally reach that after two years of tough negotiations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">According to this, the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers to use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.</seg>

<seg id="8">Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only if the generators in the steel works are replaced, an EEG levy of 20 percent falls.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also the steel industry is not surveyed.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation.</seg>

<seg id="17">The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.</seg>

<seg id="21">On the one hand, imposed import duties on import-steel impact, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have increased.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how long the price collection is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, prices would have stagnated.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry reacts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">Last but not least ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude the closing of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">Around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, despite rising prices and increasing orders, German steel manufacturers are cautious.</seg>

<seg id="30">After a short increase in May the produced amount went back for the second month in a row.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent below the previous year's figure.</seg>

<seg id="2">Ursel Kipp has always accompanied her whole life: as a young girl she was in school choir, she finished the subject of music in the teacher's school, and today the 78 year old sings in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and more lively, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good in her health and mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "because singing is a great hobby for seniors," "" "says Erhard Hackler from the German retirement" "" "Bundesretirement" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Regular cooperation allows seniors to socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve in the age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">Ursel Kipp has also made this experience in her choir: "to speak and organise oneself, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together."</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be strenuous in the positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For this purpose, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly challenge their lungs are not so fast from the pudding even in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice at the age, Singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "older people often have a very special effect," "" "says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Association of the Senior Citizens Organisations." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, the common singing had a much higher value, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening of songs in older people stimulates many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their adolescence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Due to lyrics and especially melodies, people who suffer from dementia suffer from long-standing events.</seg>
<seg id="19">While singing, the head is also required to perform special performance, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time focusing on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - that's a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just older people who live alone do so not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir," "" "says Hackler." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Even the self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I practise for a long time, I become better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you want to try a new hobby, don't hesitate - even if he thinks that you have little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who can hear when there's a tone next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">Looking for the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of friends in a retirement choir, one can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer insights on the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Whoever wants to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you don't have access to the internet, the family, friends or neighbors can ask for help with the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating - that applies to any age.</seg>

<seg id="14">Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-western coast and in Chumphon on the Southeast Coast demanded several wounded.</seg>
<seg id="15">It was said that there was a connection with the explosions of Hua Hin.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "the bomb attacks bear the same signature," "" "said army general Danai Kritchavee Friday morning before journalists." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "we assume that this is a coordinated attack." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">It is too early to express themselves to potential motives - however, it is likely to be the acts of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the attacks also Thai media wanted to see a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamic resistance movement or with international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is only local sabotage that is limited to limited areas and provinces," "" "said a speaker in Bangkok." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It is rather assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta have been laid.</seg>
<seg id="23">The authorities would have kept secret notes on upcoming attacks in the south of the country in recent days - however, they were not informed about the exact time and places.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police proved their officials throughout the country to enhance safety around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand, there are still smaller bombings, but mostly they do not address tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hua Hin is a palace that was used for years by Thailands King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">After the actual bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions issued by the Thai security authorities.</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and its surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="30">After clashes between security forces and Muslim populations, there will be no need for necessary journeys to these provinces.</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drawn up by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military great influence over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta head and prime minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country moves towards stability, an improvement in economic conditions and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military unta, who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, benefits himself to have led the Kingdom back to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the revolting revolt of Muslim rebels in the far south of the country for years.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Almost a year ago, in Bangkok, 20 people were killed at a stop in a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the bloodiest attack of the recent history of the country.</seg>

<seg id="8">But it was rather his not exactly athletic figure that attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf, the waste water charge will be increased at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are needed.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a clear calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will be 4.37 euros per cubic meter.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, in the approval of the household by the District Office of Kulmbach, it was established that under covers for these wastewater facilities.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to the legal basis, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the systems cost-effectively.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of 1 October 2016, the citizens as well as the trade and industrial companies from the first half of the world, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">Revenue increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Director of the Board of Directors Herbert Schmidt showed the panel, a new calculation of charges for the sewage plants of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- and undercover from the previous period of calculation can also be compensated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt explained the serious fee increases in all three wastewater facilities with relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Due to the low distribution basis, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, due to their age refurbishment and repair expenses, all three plants will continue to appeal to a significant extent in all three plants.</seg>
<seg id="14">The facility in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the facilities for the world's ahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt explained that the sewage plant in Azendorf had to replace the mechanical ventilation system due to a damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">After almost 20 years of operation the first sewage pond had to be removed, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation system was installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "this extraordinary expenditure resulted in the continued care and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which are still clearly below the current level during the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012.</seg>

<seg id="2">Snapchat states that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is insensitive to breeds.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filtering tool, Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change the reality and to play with identities in such a way that borders on the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from Roy Lichtenstein's painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are blended, standalone tools that generate more than 30 million selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All the mistakes are brought to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the past Snapchat filters have critiqued criticism in which they were accused of promoting Black face or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week proposed a filter to some users who gave them slit eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics named it a racist caricature of Asians - "Yellow hawk."</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked if these repeated controversies had caused a bigger problem that the company had a lot of diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage were widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it had deactivated the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company had an apology: the filter meant homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of infringing clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets were widely used over the photos, said that the filter was "hurting and the least said to be unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "she added that" "" "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contradictory Asian caricature and filter effects." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellowish-proof, but that the yellow face was dragged into the fracking extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats great audience of young people - who are more diverse than their older opponents - might expect to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one of Snapchats filters creates a picture that is offensive to a user, it is much more difficult for such things to stay unnoticed than it was the case before, "said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu, who works as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay on media and in a telephone interview, she said she believes that racial controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the snapchat setting practices.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu also criticized the large part white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce, so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinesich-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colours that work there, but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable in order to say something about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that has largely left Snapchat unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and indicates its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a personnel officer concentrating on sub-represented population groups and on internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu also said that she will keep her Snapchat account closed and added, "I wonder if they need more users than us to say that it is not O.K.."</seg>

<seg id="5">"" "" "" "intelligence services typically detectable by high-ranking Centcom commanders posted a positive picture of US efforts against terrorism as it had allowed actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services," "" "quoted a newspaper article."

<seg id="6">"what happened in the CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, Republican Member of the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership mistakes in the CentCom range to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents in detail the continual problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that government tips have given directions to change reports, it shows how analysts exposed to pressure from their superiors, to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, comments and statements before Congress were much more positive than the facts" "" "stated the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom investor publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could already begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigations, it is so clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican congressman from Kansas, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, Central Command's leaders changed the intelligence reports to play down the danger of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called Task Force into life after they were admitted that analysts worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed findings during the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of CentCom reports are under way by the Secretary General of the Defense Department.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "in 2014 and 2015, CentCom created an overly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services," "" "announced the highest-ranking democrat in the committee, a member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process," "" "Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed publication of intelligence reports," "" "said the moral of analysts and" "" "gave too little room for deviating opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats did not give any reference to the intervention of the White House with the CentCom analyst about a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon's general inspector, who were admitted to complaints by CentCom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, there was a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the reports of the congress, while the investigations of the General Inspector were still under way.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also stated that" "" "experts sometimes have diverging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion which is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the accusations of last year have raised the question whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of sub-activities of more than ten years ago when a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush only foresaw a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker stated that contrary to the statements made by the government, airstrikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, this knowledge was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damaliger orders, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature because of his overly positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin was retired in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after having shot three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockeyteam of women in a match on Thursday against India that the American women won 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games were supposed to be a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she could not remember that ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "I have no idea." "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their goals in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">But they know: the American women are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Britons in the first place, which remain undefeated after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter final, the game will decide which of the two will win the first and second place within their group of six teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first place will take the strong Dutchman a little longer from the path that the other group will lead.</seg>
<seg id="10">Whatever the game takes place on Saturday, the American women have triggered a surprising whirlwind of their success story, four years after they landed in the last London Games on the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had a Hockeybat in her hands for the first time with three years (her two older sisters played sports at Drexel University), at the age of 16, she became national player in the United States, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she couldn't qualify for the squad.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>

<seg id="18">We have completely rocked the rudder.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening, Bam opened the door in the first half of the game with a backlash from the local area.</seg>
<seg id="20">India went into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the center and knocked the ball into the gate to get the Americans a 2-0 guide.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of trampolines</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late it is, it's the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel steadily and inevitable, a fast relay race between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stick, which is passed from the wristband to a swimmer to the triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time with the Olympics and a swarm of women with dimples, could have been among these well-known names sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising, if it were a swimmer, gymner, or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event equal.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shadow are the sports that are not universally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breaststroke and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I would like to make arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although jumping on a trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, it was so scanty that many of those I had questioned were not aware that it was a sport for the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to compete, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and had an athlete up to 2012 who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian women for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain outsider character, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than the one for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I'm not an expert, but I'm just one enthusiast enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristic potential - the meatonic tremor of his never-ending bounce - but also the grace of doing gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially unites them.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means" "" "jumping board" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Up-and-coming winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot up to 30 feet in the air and have to hit a number of falling motions (turning, fencing and saltos) before landing on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to the official Olympic program, they are evaluated according to execution, difficulty level and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-day athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio against each other.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight forward.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medal hopes have to go further, faster, up and down in their quest for gold, sometimes up to the goal, sometimes back and forth, upwards and downwards on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They do not only chase the finish line or the starting wall, but also a further highlight in the television transmission: the world or the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented aspiration is posh, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel fatiguing even when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers an breathing spell.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward motion is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, apparently weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly upwards.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final rounds of the women will be held on Friday afternoon, in the streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; that of the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will exude the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 2: 00 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia-Mania they promise a calm, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the friezing and the objectification of male athletes - as the male U.S. gymnasts recently suggested - then Mr. Dooley expects his new fan base to go to air.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long is an ally of the US</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators calling for political changes in Ethiopia met with the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses testifies that tens of protesters were killed during clashes with the police during firing changes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia able to collapse right now?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the government's response has been ruthless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen shot dead on unarmed demonstrators and killed them.</seg>
<seg id="11">Videos about the protests that are probably from the last or beginning of this year show how security people hit young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Council now demands a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terror hazards across the region, particularly in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital of Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, whereby dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and don't have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," "" "said Seamm Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold in relation to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a far-reaching election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions are rising along the border to Eritrea; a fight for this shaky, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts are concerned that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been forced more or less in recent years, can exploit the turbulence and arm themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of getting tinkly beneath the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years many Ethiopians were able to communicate via social media since cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more common and internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians allowed them to join the protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons the Amharas, who predominantly come from Ethiopia, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in flat land areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are going to coordinate under a screen," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairistically dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray who account for about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military, intelligence services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "the third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopian Prime Minister until his death on a non-publicized illness in 2012 for 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of discontent and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the present regime lacks this fundamental skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for obscure reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia experienced such a upheaval was in 2005 after thousands protested against elections, seemingly fueled by the government according to the analysts and then stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the ensuing raids, many protesters were killed, even if they were less than in the last few months and that time of turbulence passed relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and their measurable progress in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal displeasure of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters attacked Gondar, an amharan city, businesses conducted by Tigray and hate against the Tigray is becoming more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests will bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a base for Dronenflug across the neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West wants to support democracy clearly, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region.</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "Donald Trump sums up his claim Obama had established ISIS" "" "sarcasm" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">On Friday, Donald J. Trump was trying to scatter the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking that his repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, would have been the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not serious.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidates, whether he is able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings its associates, who endeavour to take care of him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position, to declare statements which he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">Having made the hint at an election campaign event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump calling back on Thursday claimed that he really did not intend to interpret, the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweets Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastically.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was the opposite to the previous day Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant the accusation completely seriously.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism sparkles down on Mr. Trump while he has tried to steer the focus of his campaign because of falling survey results on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton kept talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried again to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">On Twitter he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he had a strong criticism when he said that the Russians were to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but he later explained, "Of course I said that sarcastically."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then call back on demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive, and then, if necessary," "" "clarify" "" "according to how the reaction fails." "" "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert that monitors the language of both candidates." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also believe he is clever enough to hold his statements vaguely enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has accepted an even more corrosive tone, as his survey figures have gone further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was released on Friday, showed a leading lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally trying to excuse himself for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while emphasizing the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump Scherze has brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent advocates of trumps, was struggling to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political commentaries," "" "said Mr. Giuliani to the correctness of Mr. Trump's statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it Hinterbänkler, completely wrong and that's why it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to expand by allowing the situation in the Middle East to be aggressive under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of jumping around on each of his words and being prejudiced against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he ridiculed the" "" "poor, miserable" "" "television experts trying to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats apologized to Mr. Trump as a further proof that he was unsuitable for the Presidency.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland shark: the oldest eddy is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This hai was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland sharks will only get offspring with 150 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Greenlandshark swims leisurely at the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches just 1,220 meters on average.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it matters, the five-meter-long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast with this top speed as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle shaped lifestyle seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at least by a Greenland shark, who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity," commented Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist suspected that Greenland's sharks are becoming a stone age.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was lacking.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland sharks are hard to observe, finally they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow motion, measured in front of Svalbard, measured six animals with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, this sharks make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They may chase sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the polar sea and look for cadaver, which torques from higher water layers downward.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland sharks which caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the biggest 502 centimeter measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed using the carbon-14 method the lens nucleus of the sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This center of the eye lens arises already before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it are later no longer renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Therefore, their birth was to be in the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons hunt larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the length of the third smallest animal with a length of 220 centimeters, the lentil nucleus, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, so its 50th birthday would probably have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 quantities in their lens nucleus, resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the Carbon-14 Clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493-centimeter-long Grönlandshark, while the record shark with 502 centimeters might be even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to associate the length with an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland's haie with the increase obviously has at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is no coincidence that such methane emissions live mainly in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland wal, in whose bacon on the neck a 120 year old harpoon tip was stuck, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on sparring flames.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they later mature and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often very big.</seg>
<seg id="38">The volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal receives heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The loss of heat from one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal is therefore more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as soon as possible," explains the Evolutionbiologist Scheuerlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal should, on the other hand, invest his resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="1">Jewish director dissolves Berlin hotel because Israeli pre-election was removed after "Arab" demand - RT News</seg>

<seg id="3">Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah," left his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.</seg>
<seg id="4">During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the country's country selection list.</seg>
<seg id="5">The country, however, was not listed between the countries that can be invoked directly from the hotel room.</seg>
<seg id="6">How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel has been eliminated and deleted?</seg>
<seg id="7">Wrote Lanzmann.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner razed last night in the men's team Sprint in Velodrom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23 year old from Glasgow took the anchorage, which his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made his own. the Jussi proudly made the legend when he stormed home to win a victory from the favourites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after catching a modest sixth place in the London rail world championships in spite of Hoys's withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as an execution.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gary's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed, when they saw potential in the Scots, which has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hinder, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy winning - and Skinner prevailed in the qualifying rounds of an olympic board, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">After his lap, however, Kenny pushed the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation, driving in a higher gear in order to slow it down and enable Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked at his position as a BBC expert and dropped Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they climbed the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it's a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an olympic record in the final round and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 on the site Kennys and Hoys, Hinder admitted that after a weak start he deliberately dropped on the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He withdrew this statement later and there was no objection of England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">This time there was no such problem with such an outstanding victory.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Hinder said," "" "It feels like the whole GB flags on the tribune like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We came together in the last three months as a team.</seg>
<seg id="25">With so many world titles we have come so badly that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which has won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If that is a barometer of our progress over the past five months, we expect successful five days in the velodrome.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kenny it is possible to repeat Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">This would be for Kenny - exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for British sports; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same from Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny is next in the Sprint, which starts today and will go for three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "" "I just enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "Hinder said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Whedly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometer race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the finish in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record won in London in 2012 was 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will be held today on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had argued in front of the qualification yesterday with representatives when officials called him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued and finished tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on its strong track cycling team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to bring a crowd of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary portrayal of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">Dramas played in the background, thus the resignation of Shane Sutton's technical director in April in the midst of Sesto and Mobbingvorschaufers as well as the retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks as if the legendary reputation GBs, which reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of melt-melt from Portland is questionable due to the lifting of the energy contract</seg>
<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium melts of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workstations of workers - are at stake, as the plant operator announces the energy supply contract, thereby raising all supply contracts, as the supply company supplies.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step was followed by the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to plant the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A grant that is set for 20 years will expire in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Alcoa in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk during closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effect because the melt-melt consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa closed the Point Henry melt, which last year led to a closure of the Anglesea powerplant.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting of Alcoa in Portland is losing money and risking a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminum melt with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will terminate their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is in the majority ownership of a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller portions.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity by enamel," "" "said the company." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "AGL also stated that the treaties should be so-called" "" "hedging transactions" "", "which should have come into effect from November 2016." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12 month notice period, so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "therefore, AGL assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenue," "" "said the electricity supplier." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on the revenue on AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "AGL announced that the value of the contracts had already been depreciated in his annual subscription in the amount of $187 million in" "" "expecting a cancellation" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "Alcoa agreed that the decision to book the contracts was the ability to operate the" "" "Alcoas" "" "ability... to operate the melt or to ensure the supply of the melt." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said that it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which would have come into effect from November this year, even if it is still an explanation of why it has resigned from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Due to the poor economic conditions of the industry, analysts warn of the possible closure of the Portland melt-melt in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the Analyst's statements at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations said Stephen Mikkelsen that Portland annually consume around 600 megawatts and tomato around 900 megawatts of electricity.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September edition of the US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and running on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on her Instagram account.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to tears," "" "Kendall wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The unveiling of the cover followed a bizarre (or just keeping Up with the Kardashians), mirrored reality video showing the entire Kardashian Jenner family (except the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the well-loved Showbiz-uncle and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest).</seg>
<seg id="6">This is the cliché of almost every episode episode of a child's show (Seacrest brought the sentence "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September edition of Vogue, surely a new era of cardashians has begun.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's big sister Kim will have struck her as far as the Vogue cover is concerned (she and her husband Kanye West were to see in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most sold issue of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that resembles an illustrated book rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (According to the 832 pages of the tome 615 pages advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The revelation of his cover-star is eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine have been filtered through before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "in recent years there were clearly more" "" "celebrities that mom" "" "as" "" "models that are celebrities" "" "on the cover." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar-Award winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honour.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the little chance that Mrs Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the earlier category, she is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to celebrities or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if everything is applicable to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are truly talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, was one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course Jenners' success is not pleasing to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With her reality TV story Jenners's position in the fashion world was always tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June, the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized them and called them "the mistlettes of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings boiled down again when the news came out with the appearance Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But on the displeasure seems to pass by the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">She is running for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your priming of Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">You and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sells her made pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.</seg>

<seg id="4">The tool weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, therefore it was not good in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was rather clumsy.</seg>
<seg id="7">The built-in memory was at the beginning eight megabytes, which would be enough for about two selfies with high resolution.</seg>

<seg id="9">"" "the" "" "Nokia 9000 communicator" "" "came to business exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, and it was the first smartphone." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few Euro, lovers can buy the devices on the Internet, but they somehow come from the stone age of the internet age.</seg>
<seg id="11">20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer trade fair Cebit in Hanover as an "office in the west pocket format."</seg>
<seg id="13">Indeed, the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot for then standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax was the communicator.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser, albeit slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then we found a small keyboard and a black-and-white-screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, ie about 1400 euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 Euro in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">In August 1996, no one could suspect that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything has changed.</seg>
<seg id="22">Smart phones are a success story, even if not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Finns' cell phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster, was finally sold to Microsoft and wound up.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, the market is dominated by providers who came all a lot later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">Being online always and everywhere is everyday life for a lot of people.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="27">Around 1.4 billion devices were sold, and 555 million units were sold on Samsung and Apple.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the projections of a new NASA climate model Venus was probably once habitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus by using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have herdded similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously suggested that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and nevertheless slowly spread.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably had more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to house life and protected from rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "in the GISS simulation model simulation the slow rotation of Venus is exposed to its daylight for almost two months," "" "said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than that of the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution that was previously suspected by planet researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was presumably inhabitable, the Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their steam was burnt away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their hydro-gen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect - the Venus, which we know today.</seg>

<seg id="1">Olympics 2016: chen Xinyi, Silwia Daniova and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Catch: because of a positive doping test, Weightlifeber Adrian Zielinski is not allowed to start from Poland in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be overshadowed by the first official doping cases.</seg>
<seg id="4">An experienced athlete would have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh race day, the first official doping cases have become known to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">Chinese swimmers Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter roadblocks in Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and ruled out in Brazil - immediately before the onset of the already critically acclaimed athletics competitions this news is coming to an end.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide has been proven last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday afternoon, the International Sports Court CAS confirmed its expulsion from the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old finished fourth in the final over 100 m of butterfly, just 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen would have participated in the events above 50 m Freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">The International Olympic Committee (IOC) requested the opening of the B-test and a hearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "the national association assumes the matter" "" "very serious and demands full cooperation in the investigation," "" "cited Xinhua from a message:" "" "we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the judgment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history it is no longer the IOC, but the CAS is responsible for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also in the night of Rio the news seeps over the positive test at Danikowa, the 33-year-old went on with it even into the offensive.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "this was an incredible shock," "" "she said to the Bulgarian TV station BNT." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "she is innocent," "" "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," "" "said the Athletics." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, the banned substance should be the EPO blood doping agent.</seg>
<seg id="18">Daniova was suspended for the time being, according to BNT the B-sample should already be positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov immediately expressed criticism of the bulletin.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "I don't understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions," "" "he said:" "" "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, all weight lifters from the chronically doping nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested like his brother Tomasz three days earlier on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both pollute the intake, but both may not start in class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before the start of the athletes, the Danikowa case is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The World Association IAAF had banned the entire Russian squad, except for systematic doping, and also the parent nation of Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the swimming sport, the former breaches in China also caused violent confrontations between the athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">Thus the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang.</seg>
<seg id="28">"sun Yang pinkelt lilac."</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "when I see the podium above 200 m Freestyle, I want to hand over," "" "Lacourt said in French radio." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun was also the focal point of an exploration of the Australian Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I have no time and no respect for doping fraud," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Sun was tested positively by the Chinese championships in 2014 to the stimulant Trimetazidin, but only had to leave a three month lock.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: so perfide erpresses hackers their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail-malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey conducted by malware protection specialists Malwarebytes, among 540 businesses in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies were at least once, partly multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software in the past twelve months.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, nearly 20 percent of the companies were already the target of ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom-money required by the perpetrators to re-use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the reports of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators specialize in terms of attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially resulting cancellation fee will be considerably higher than with private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of malware," explains Malwarebytes-chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the painting programs were designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the change to company attuned in recent months was terrifying fast.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works after a simple pattern: once active on a victim's computer, it searches for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently, the software presents the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the end key code to the files, the victims must pay money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrency Bitcoin -.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users are the personal photo database on the game, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">The damage is correspondingly higher when a ransomware hits.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 per cent of the affected German companies reported loss of turnover through ransomware, 13 percent even had to interrupt the business operation, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims:" "" "don't pay, you only support the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers, it is difficult to reject the perpetrator's claim in the face of standstill in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build up a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure analyzed the user-winning areas and contact with blackmail and came to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain to their victims via chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, set free accessible support websites or decode for free sample files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private persons are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies need to negotiate partly hard and pay five-digit sums to return their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risky profits from ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming more and more professional and share the work, says Security Expert Chester Wisniewski of the anti-virus provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware around within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">It is more likely that these are three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software building kit to the actual blackmailers.</seg>
<seg id="30">The so-called malware kits have been created by buying malware, advice and tools for a one-time, fixed price range between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included is a customization tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmailers then seek further hackers to spread the newly bought software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the forums on the ground, buys the set of a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually the criminals instruct spammers to spread," "" "explains Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of the company IT managers in the Malwarebytes poll trust to be able to repel Ransomware by means of file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful exhaustion, the perpetrators are instead threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," "" "said Malwarebytes-chief Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Thus, the damage potential is much higher than before, depending on the type of data.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the future, the perpetrators could also have completely new targets on the internet of things in the future.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackerkonferenz, Defcon, safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and the versatility of a minivans.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds pretty overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V seems rather small, the passengers have plenty of room in the first row and in the rear, it doesn't work tight at any point.</seg>
<seg id="6">The interior materials are well-processed and have a pleasant effect, only the upper side of the cockpit will fall off.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles when it comes to storage.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "there is not only a luggage compartment of 453 l for raised and 1026 l where folded backs are available, but there are the" "" "Magic Seats" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the back bench can be folded like Kinoessel and thus offer storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the floor to ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The boot can be loaded easily, but the charging height is slightly higher at 650 mm than in the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide revolutions.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he is likely to quieter his work a bit more quietly.</seg>
<seg id="13">The average daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is enjoyable.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another motorization: a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">But the steering is likely to be a bit more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "the equipment in the top variant" "" "Executive" "" "leaves nothing to be desired." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The safety systems include the City emergency brake assist (runs up to 32), the collision warning system and lane keeping assist.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "the collision worker sometimes irritates because he assesses many obstacles as" "" "approaching objects" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">The high-beam assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed controller responds to the traffic sign detection and throttles the speed when necessary.</seg>
<seg id="23">But the full connectivity is only available for top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and one HDMI bushing are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who don't want to invest so much will receive the petrol engine from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, one rolls around eternally, at night, one is awake for hours, in the morning it is no longer to think about sleep well before the wake-up ring.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than 10 percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleep problems manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and many causes can be attributed to them, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society for Sleep Therapy and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understands for the time being, however, is the Insomnia, that is, an in-and-sleep disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just being able to sleep makes many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, board member of the German Medical Association with Practice in Lower Saxony, Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind this can be organic, mental or behavioural factors, but also drugs.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not infrequently is the sleep disorder expression of another condition.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is often common in a depression," "" "says Weber." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors oppress each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, if you have a herniated disc, you can sleep well, wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to pondering about everyday problems and worries, then there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and are affected by the day should go to the doctor, tell them.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: you are depressed, tired, sleepy, has difficulty with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To ease sleeping disorder, it is important to find out the causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">The treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquired.</seg>
<seg id="22">Dr. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Medical Center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin, emphasises the low-lying sleep physician in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is why one should first contact the family doctor in case of sleep problems, he advises.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified with investigations, whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">In order to study in the sleep lab, doctors advise, for example, in snoring with breathing dropouts, in case of illness, sleepwalkers or if you do not find the cause of a dormant disorder, Fietze explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare yourself for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "please do not make a nap," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After tiling, one goes to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-goggles, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera draws the sleeping person on the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a few screw plugs on which you can apply for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">They don't sleep on the day, do not watch TV for sleep, don't watch TV while sleeping, don't watch TV at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that's not conducive to it at all.</seg>

<seg id="2">Professional thieves at Dusseldorf Airport</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, two women and two men aged 50 to 61 were arrested by the police of Düsseldorf police.</seg>
<seg id="4">The suspects had committed several bags and luggage piles as a gang.</seg>
<seg id="5">At 21.30 p.m. civilian officials in the area of the airport Düsseldorf recognised a gang that was known to the police of past theft delirities.</seg>
<seg id="6">Since mid-July this year, the two women and two men had committed several offences and were involved in a collaborative, collaborative and particularly professional manner.</seg>
<seg id="7">The specialists of the Criminal Investigate 34 can demonstrate four acts to the thieves who had been specifically indented for crimes against Germany.</seg>
<seg id="8">In total, they carried over 15,000 Euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few linden trees, a rest of cobblestones in between: the Riga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like this at first sight, but the police is one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If one goes along the road from east to west, one passes at playgrounds, a fresher kindergarten and a bioladen.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "someone has" "" "ugly" "" "on the facade of a grey house." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Compared to a Lidl, which is to be demolished even soon, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments is to be built here by 2017.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "article about this" "" "trendy neighborhood" "", "as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain calls, will be favored by burning cars in recent weeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rented contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin interior senator Henkel has advocated a tough action by the police against the project, called the area as "no-go-zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After clearing the premises on the ground floor, the Katerschmiede, with 300 police officers, the police patrolling official statements for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three crew wagons on site, locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the meantime, construction workers were renovated on behalf of the unknown house owners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal, and one day later police and construction workers moved under the cheers of sympathisers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the street is peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk in the late night.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the building projects are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Leftist violence is not the chief concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who raises three children here, are mainly annoyed by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the building projects they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "it doesn't sound like a" "" "Kiez" "", "who wanted a majority of police protection from the left." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, which the Berlin interior senator and the police put up between house owners and their neighbours, apparently does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain, in the east of Berlin, was actually a traditional workers "quarter, which, even today, has a low average and has a high poverty risk compared to the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former East German Democratic Republic, including almost all the mainz street near the Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was cleared in a real street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people who occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the neighborhood has become increasingly popular for tourists and ballads from all over the world over the past few years.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is reflected in the rents which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols for this development: they detect them from thrown discs or freshly painted facades, which have been discarded with paint bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other street was mentioned this year as often as" "" "left-autonomous violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason for not all of the neighbours to view this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily impacted by crime: crimes such as personal injury, according to statistics, are almost exclusively directed against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The largest part of the criminal offences constitute material damage, which tend to hit the newly built and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer who has lived in a tenant house next to the disputed 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As far as violence is concerned, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbours, they are not destined to be.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars are no longer available in the rigs.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the architect, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "here, one helps one another, lives together on the road and gets more of each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has been deliberately drawn into the streets of Riga - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is why it was so important that the residents get back their road: from the police, the politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents, as Neugebauer, the street is still taken away: due to faceless newbuildings in former buildings, which displace the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "in the end, these are condominiums that are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well used here," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I cannot approve violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what do you want to do if someone never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For those who are annoyed by color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who come here should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub neighborhood to complain badly about noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons presented only with first names have asked not to be called by their proper name.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee commissioner</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact partner for integration and organisation.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the Refugee Officer of Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of the administration around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working group refugee aid, administration, authorities and anyone else interfering with.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine's client of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is there now, the affluent Wollmilchsau, which has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thus some - less ridiculed than on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">We were looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-term experience in the field of social work, just an enduring wool milksau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administration work is not a central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organization, work with people on site and behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been with us for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine Customer, that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers soon in Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "a serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection provision.</seg>
<seg id="19">They have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs of the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the communes themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Landratsamt to Commune and Jobcentre.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects but not every owner wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">In fact, the administration does not find any private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it is not possible to rely on private apartments, such as Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common dwellings have to be intimidated as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">In other words, new containers will soon be set up in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, are Regine's customers and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a firm place of residence, there are internships, training centres, school places, one-euro jobs and aid activities for refugees and migrants who need to be undamaged or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "more places would be good," "" "says Regine Customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house masters, do charitable work - and that motivates and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But work doesn't just mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and the customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So it takes offers like sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also here are administration and honorary posts.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees feel that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They need to explain to the refugees that it takes time and they can bridge the time wisely, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who develop the feeling that he could not help anyone in Urbach would not be able to work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "but there are also problems," "" "says the customer," "" "people who don't work at all." "" "the work of Deuschle and the customer is therefore always motivated to motivate others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all that is already a" "" "mammoth task." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two have fear of radicalization after the latest occurrences, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "Regine's client clearly says," "" "what some people may call naive." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins will make them completely obsessed.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the main and honorary officials have to look for jobs in the region and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that a new surge of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, politics abhors.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to place them helpers on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine's client also makes it clear that the Urbacher is already utilized to integrate the existing people in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
