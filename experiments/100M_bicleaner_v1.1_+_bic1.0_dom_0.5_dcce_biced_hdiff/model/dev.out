Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu isn &apos;t just a friendly one .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
at the meeting , however , it should also be about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and repro@@ aches Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal between the two has deterior@@ ated further by the deal struck by Obama on Iran &apos;s nuclear programme .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu , at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , held a controversial speech in front of the US Congress , which was partly considered an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with regard to the election forthcoming in Israel .
in an emergency call , Professor tells us to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officers would have to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was important to emphasize that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably excited and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the house the officials found the cor@@ pse of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was scri@@ b@@ bling on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted I could undo it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who loved me ever . &quot;
there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school premises , where according to the police , he shot a popular professor of history , E@@ than Schmidt , who shot and killed at the door to his office .
Delta State University police chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff listened to shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb did the fat@@ eful emergency at some point after that .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after the shooting in the university , forcing students and teachers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal pre@@ history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a book written by him , Schmidt himself mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty contains 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time there were some tendencies to problematic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised the Lamb , said he was also a little excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
she had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and told him that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
the latest changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the doc@@ torate , which Lamb had worked so hard for him , would represent no guarantee for an automatic path to an employment as assistant professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the escape from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs Spur later , when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before being arrested , Lamb opened himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb opened his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and education .
he earned a doc@@ torate in the spring of education .
one of the long @-@ time friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met together with friends .
she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar playing .
he was the s@@ warm of women at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all girls were melting away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and resident in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , Lamb said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but had friends and had a daughter who was 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail occurred three years ago both on a summer fair market .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for various companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a fain@@ tly lighted bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night of September 5 for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and oral music playing before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that anything was wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were sitting up and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in Native American and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his bro@@ therhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening , about 900 people participated in the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght anniversary celebration .
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt took part in the M@@ ahn@@ guard , while the Univers@@ it√§@@ tsch@@ or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and Ama@@ zing Grace sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associ@@ ated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ sters P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb opened the emergency when he had shot Schmidt , and that lamb in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss was called his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
To@@ ys R Us plan to employ fewer workers for the Christmas season
To@@ ys R Us says that it won &apos;t be as many Christmas seasonal workers as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers throughout the country . 4@@ 5.000 people were hired during the Christmas season 2014 .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees from October to December is increasing .
while the holidays are still months away , the Christmas business is drawing closer , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equi@@ p shops with employees who sell , ship and deliver products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael J. Fox is jo@@ king over his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Date &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Princess Diana &quot; &quot; &quot;
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we were sitting in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to mind that I am a simulated mo@@ b and a length of arms about being with the princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s really for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ disputed the biggest time travel film ever filmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
back in Time will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN chief said there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says that his response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will only exac@@ erb@@ ate violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN chief reiter@@ ates all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and to support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution .
however , Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , the United Kingdom and France - at the edge of the meeting of the General Assembly this month in order to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to tackle the crisis in Syria , Ban has called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity that they have proven in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 Survey results show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks at poll@@ s , it has not worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating the real estate mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of which won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize the l@@ umps of per@@ sever@@ ance and begin to let their dollar flow to overthrow it .
here are some current survey figures indicating that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
the popularity of tr@@ umps has turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two out of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
now six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ vot@@ er GO@@ P would be happy with plat@@ former as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; happy , &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two out of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they are &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about junk ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they are &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans does not regard s@@ ling@@ ing temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of Irish voters tend to believe that real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , says ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is seen in the first state election state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively perform his ministry , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temp@@ er did not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
repub@@ li@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they set up their hats , Republi@@ can voters keep up Tr@@ ump for real .
if they are asked who most likely wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , four out of ten will say that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four out of ten at the end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P @-@ voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination vis @-@ √† @-@ vis only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
yet it shows that a large number of GO@@ P @-@ voters can view the campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump sums up almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to s@@ ling@@ ing , while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is diff@@ used to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump re@@ aps the majority support .
he has 13 points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally on edge Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday reveals that only slightly more than half of voters supporting Tr@@ ump are saying they have fixed their votes firmly .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one really can say never change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nevertheless , the strongest competition is the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are dou@@ bly so frequent for pumping .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with the issue of immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign calling immig@@ rant from Mexico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two months ago , immigration has been a turning point in public discourse in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression by Tr@@ ump will keep decisive His@@ pan@@ o Americans away from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post Survey of Monday six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on issues of immigration .
so long as immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ ight , Donald Tr@@ ump will appear to do so .
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs to new levels .
in the meantime , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son account for about half the support of Republi@@ can voters , mainly due to their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days Survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are also mad at Washington .
a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago , shows that three of four I@@ owa Repub@@ lic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish angry . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential districts of Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg is the most expensive residence - with a view over the North Sea .
in the street , one square meter of a can@@ opy station costs an average of 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; stated in the study - therefore , the high price .
a new study shows in which particular locations a square meter costs the most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student book in Munich are not really little .
unlike Germany &apos;s top residential areas , however , the price is like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; V√∂lk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euros not - per square meter , well @-@ marked .
but it &apos;s good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here as an exception .
champi@@ ons League : Bayern @-@ dream start thanks to M√ºller and G√∂t@@ ze
double sc@@ orer in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bavarian star Thomas M√ºller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas M√ºller paved the way to the FC Bayern 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
world champi@@ ons Thomas M√ºller and Mario G√∂t@@ ze gave the FC Bayern a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; in the witch @-@ chair of Pi@@ ra@@ eus .
the team of Train@@ ers P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in a hot atmosphere thanks to M√ºll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ at@@ ous hits ( 89 . ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth star success in series is supposed to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
M√ºller won the Champions League for the Bavarian leadership in the Champions League for the Bavarian leadership , with the aid of Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who caused a f@@ lange of the World Champion to pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp Lah@@ ti promised before the match at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 - and the Munich @-@ based words . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed idea without gl@@ itter@@ ing .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his latest six home games in the top class , including well @-@ known clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ √©@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 we also stum@@ bled on Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bav@@ arians , defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they ran cour@@ age@@ ously , but often too in@@ ventive in their offen@@ sives ende@@ a@@ vors .
the attacks were often initiated by a game shift on the left @-@ wing Douglas Costa , which was seldom passed through against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
M√ºller had more luck from the right , when his flan@@ k hit the right half @-@ field in the left upper corner of the gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first of all , as Olympi@@ ac@@ os stri@@ ker Ide@@ ye Brown hit Poland &apos;s head ball from the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto was par@@ ked with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians had their usual dominant play , Pi@@ ra@@ eus was able to set con@@ i@@ fer bites .
but on the door@@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er there was a discount .
so , for instance , when he drew a shot from the idea of the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
in front of him Guardi@@ ola defended a chain of four chains with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well .
Mario G√∂t@@ ze , back to muscular problems in the Ka@@ der , was sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero gave the green light only after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director Matthias Sam@@ mer on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to make something different , this is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also at the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an on the beaten Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
G√∂t@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , M√ºller made another bet by el@@ f@@ meter .
in front of the game it had come to power in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly war@@ med Bayern fans had prov@@ oked the fans of host Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and went against the Munich fans with dr@@ um@@ sticks .
at least one Bayern fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
those who smoke , not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - that suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
good news : the risk of aband@@ on@@ ment disappears quickly .
smokers have a much higher risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study conducted by an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ times higher .
the scientists had watched more than 23@@ 300 participants .
the main causes of tooth loss are c@@ aries and inflammation of the gum , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphasizes the authors .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth therefore goes back to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk however within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could , however , take over ten years before the endanger@@ ment goes back to the level of non @-@ smokers , said Er@@ it@@ tor Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people need to persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smokers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lung and blood vessels and results in good dental health right up to the old age .
in Germany more than 20 per cent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of tooth@@ lessness has been affected by the DI@@ f@@ E .
previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ scores the findings .
archae@@ ologists encounter the ruins of the late antique era at the Rhein@@ u@@ fer
archaeological findings have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the second time .
near the construction site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ levard , arch@@ e@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings have been excav@@ ated , Museum Director Marcus Trier , on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians are looking for so @-@ called ground monuments .
in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always attracted to the Department of Archae@@ ological Natural Monum@@ ents .
in the third section of the Rhine @-@ bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists were now five .
from text documents it was already known that there was a fortress in the place in the 4th century and in the 8th century a church stood , explained Trier .
beside the remains of the fortress and the church tower , a cemetery with around 350 tom@@ bs was discovered , which was probably part of the church .

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
in order to tigh@@ ten the dispute on the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TTIP , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration devices for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system which in its function corresponds to significantly more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens can trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ str√∂m in the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swe@@ de proposed introducing the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
by means of TTIP , the largest free trade zone in the world will be created with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings specifically envis@@ age that the EU states and the US jointly choose independent judges for a new Investment Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries .
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to appeal against jud@@ gements .
so far , the parties involved have agreed among themselves to arbit@@ ers , there was no objection to their judgment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussions over the past few months it has become clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system did not trust in terms of fair@@ ness and justice , Malm@@ str√∂m commented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , she wants to work towards an international investment court .
there , for instance , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) demanded primarily by major corporations are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel judi@@ ci@@ ary , where companies can collect compensation from tax@@ pa@@ yers , negotiate national laws or enforce a lowering of consumer and environmental standards .
in initial statements , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act described the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate .
the main criticism was that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German state secretary of state Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as great progress .
the Commission took into consideration essential points in the reform that Federal Minister for Economic Affairs called Sig@@ mar Gabriel in the spring with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ str√∂m .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the economic opportunities of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
when the talks on the TTIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday .
negotiations have been ongoing since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally a framework for the agreement should already be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is no longer valid .
delicate Folk from Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens was sitting on the stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy folk singer recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 persons , is almost seized by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s talk .
he tells the story of different places he repeatedly records on the map , about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they were created and what it looks like in his homeland .
since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderful creative person .
with the third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State &quot; released in 2003 , clever@@ ly composed songs seem intellig@@ ently very close to American folk in the late six@@ ties , but can be dri@@ fted into the great opul@@ ent at any time .
it is rum@@ oured that &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 U.S. states should be rec@@ alled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and in the proximity of the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and has a positive effect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
guitar and ban@@ jo are enough for him .
a year later , the musician living in New York returns to the show .
in 2005 , &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) is a well @-@ acclaimed masterpiece .
over@@ flowing with ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album goes into the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in any annual list of influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after very productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic components . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth , regular studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effects and rever@@ b .
since long since the smaller clubs have desc@@ ended , the stage shows are played here for the colorful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and big fluorescent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five @-@ member band .
in the glo@@ omy ham@@ burger More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although here nearly 2,000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the distinc@@ tly mature st@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and folk .
without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians plays through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
you hear from the audience : the talk is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and you can throw away the &quot; record basically . &quot;
only to an en@@ core , St@@ ev@@ ens thank@@ ed himself , plays acousti@@ cally few older songs and eventually bows to thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the prime minister &apos;s fra@@ ming
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut has been eag@@ erly awaited by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the prime minister &apos;s fra@@ ming session .
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will give his debut at the prime minister &apos;s fra@@ ming and for the first time to join David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to address the first of his six given questions shortly after lunch , and his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs from the neighbourhood .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip a few sessions to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary review of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s leadership , because after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Conference on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent during a commem@@ oration ceremony marking the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence has prov@@ oked criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and stands in the center of several news stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a Mr Cor@@ by@@ n spokes@@ man said he was &quot; respect@@ ful of silence &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told in the BBC Two News@@ night Program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; irrespective of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are calling for differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary party originally supported it as a leader .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Political correspon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t states that political differences are also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; st@@ acking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Labour Party , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation on profits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference that Labour should make changes to remove the whole idea of a limit altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ worker and reti@@ ring minister said that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against government plans to lower the ¬£ 26@@ ,000 by ¬£ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he is T@@ ory boss , over the last decade across the Dis@@ patch Box across the Parliament .
the Labour leader , who promised a different set of policies , says that he has asked &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and given him more than 30.000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s fra@@ ming is too confron@@ t@@ ative and that he will refrain from tac@@ kling problems like poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people instead .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the Shadow of Economic Council , will represent him if he does not participate - for example , when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into a conversation that other colleagues occasionally seize the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy show , &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s fra@@ ming .
as it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the frac@@ ture with the prime minister was considered the most important bar@@ ometer of the ruling part of a leader and his leadership in the House of Lower House and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics argued that it had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needed far @-@ reaching reforms .

pounds rise due to accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound rose mark@@ edly according to data showing an increase in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the bid objective of SA@@ B@@ Miller .
between May and July , earnings without Bon@@ uses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the quick@@ est and achieved estim@@ ation since 2009 at the time of interest increase .
the pound rose by more than 1 % over the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to ‚Ç¨ 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after tak@@ eover offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v was received .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and combine brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
berry equi@@ ties were 0.@@ 9 % higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
Gl@@ en@@ core &apos;s shares rose 5 % after the mining giant said he had taken $ 2.5 billion by a stock sale as part of his strategy of debt reduction .
the shares in the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a decrease of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his assessment for the company rating on &quot; selling . &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % after the sports@@ wear company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the head of J@@ D Sports says higher wages je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labour costs in his company , he says .
the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and this could mean that there are less additional jobs .
Jus@@ tin Bi@@ eber in the Capital : on Bi@@ eber @-@ Expedition in Berlin
Jus@@ tin Bi@@ eber , Meg@@ ast@@ ar .

the type with the plat@@ inum @-@ blonde hair is 100 million euro heavy .

currently Mon@@ si@@ eur Bi@@ eber is in Berlin .
and the generation U@@ 17 turns around .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans attended Jus@@ tin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
but since 7 am the pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates in front of Berlin &apos;s luxury hotel on Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ eber &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : here you live I@@ dol , whose poster belongs to St@@ et@@ tin since Monday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the suite in which the Canadian singer lives , costs exactly as much money the day her mo@@ m ear@@ ns for half a year .
if at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually my Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a would have to sit in the tenth grade in the gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am fulfilling her a dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
compulsory education ?
who cares ?
the fans don &apos;t .
even Bi@@ eber herself did not .
this has already taken care of .
for the advertisement in the publicity break of the supermarket he cas@@ c@@ aded three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ imp@@ le company r@@ ins@@ ed many , many dollars on the be@@ aver account .
and with every doll which looks like him and goes over the counter , Bi@@ eber collects as well .
when Jus@@ tin Bi@@ eber drinks a coffee , one amazed at the wind@@ screen .
he is said to have captured more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e goes too far .
others stress Bi@@ eber is finally in the US and Great Britain with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; in 1st place .
Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , doesn &apos;t interest the many zer@@ os first .
at least he does so .
PE@@ GI@@ DA poster brings Lebanese to potato mas@@ king idea
potatoes or D@@ √∂n@@ er ?
both - and in the potato d@@ √∂n@@ er , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger Imb@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the slogan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ √∂n@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat have put together a stick together . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ √∂n@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had seen on television by chance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , there is a barbecue in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; that &apos;s mul@@ ticul@@ tural for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the idea was to have the Lebanese registered at the Patent Office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
for this reason , Al@@ hay does not want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding also comes well with its customers .
Met@@ cash starts off @-@ line campaign to combat al@@ di@@ - collapse
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the I@@ GA branches from an Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a ground tracking campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA single dealers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di is preparing the opening of two distribution centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia in the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand I@@ GA through mainstream marketing and marketing about the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
I@@ GA dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA shops and store owners who sell approved tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish more details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler of food , alcohol and equipment passes through its annual investors strategy day .
there is a lot on the game as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ a &apos;s I@@ GA shops and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ a &apos;s I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will take away about five percent of the food market in these two states after opening its first markets and take away all available players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and about $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di has opened 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and the amounts on Met@@ cal@@ c &apos;s high fixed cost base could cost about $ 13 million before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , Met@@ cash is losing market shares in the eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ cal@@ c &apos;s sales and food business increase by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told in a business lunch in Melbourne that met@@ a would likely disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the Management Board of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ AS market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenues from Met@@ a &apos;s food and food trade , which provides about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retail outlets , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the reduction in operating debt at simultaneous pressure on sales and margins .
the wholes@@ aler , however , resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to increase sales prices with Col@@ ors and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products each week and to improve their stores by improving their stores due to fast growing fresh foods and providing a better choice of home @-@ label gro@@ c@@ eries .
Ian Mor@@ rice , Chief Executive Officer , Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging re@@ conditioning programs are to be made to El@@ an and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by President of Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ i and ear@@ ns praise as criticism for his own behaviour according to the president of Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight with the not@@ orious debate about Kyr@@ gy@@ z with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the arbitr@@ ator , and Har@@ rison said , &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to kno@@ ck down , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he beat a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cra@@ mp sh@@ ook a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the sole behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m pretty busy about is the fact that after my view , Th@@ an@@ asi was somewhat dra@@ gged into the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he broke a ra@@ cket when he lost a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a bit too stern .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with other players , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to do not consider Kyr@@ gy@@ z in the important preliminary decision , which begins on Friday , and it describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long @-@ term fixed part . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe Nick has quickly made the climb , what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he has made some bad mistakes and he deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency state , closes the border , stops refugees
Hungary declared the emergency state and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all who tried to get illegal into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border when hundreds of migrants trapped in a land of No Man and Ser@@ b officials re@@ acted with indignation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land between the two control points of the countries and built up tents and settled down there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter was floating above them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opened the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some returned from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back while more and more from Macedonia and Greece will arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; talks with Brussels and other countries will take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ nation block at a disputed meeting in Brussels did not agree on a common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states would receive further 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary did not put its hopes on a spe@@ edy action from Brussels or its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the emergency level issued on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block streets and speed asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country is planning to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country after it has ended a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were used during the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck and an entry point into the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most upcoming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU countries , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make crossing the border or damaging the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 foot ) high fence that the government built along the southern border to Serbia led to a crime . these laws also impose higher prison sentences for convic@@ ted human traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still appro@@ ve of the military application of the military , which is expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have seen on the border heavy armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people tried to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated the country .
they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of commit crimes under the new laws .
authorities are in the process of re@@ pairing the fence .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders was arrived .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container in order to process people &apos;s data and squee@@ ze a crowd to squee@@ ze themselves there .
about 20 failed to enter , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l
former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to keep a double @-@ digit advance in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face to the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent before ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidates for the Pres@@ i@@ dency , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the start of the preliminary elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say their opinion is determined which candidates they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders scored some gains .
Clinton has a big advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have reduced .
their support among the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points .
Clin@@ tons &apos;s advantage in democratic constitu@@ ents under the age of 50 has evapor@@ ated , and they and s@@ anders are now at the same height .
Clinton , however , has a big advantage with the older voters .
last month , Clinton was a double @-@ digit fron@@ tier in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has a 5 point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries state that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps it is not surprising that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about it .
the views are stronger mixed with those who don &apos;t currently support Clinton - just about a quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their peak candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman president is ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clin@@ tons &apos;s supporters have also mentioned their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with problems and eligi@@ bility are also cited .
since the Vice @-@ President creates a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the pre @-@ elections want to see him in the race - although a third thinks he should not do it .
if democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are asked who is their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the helm .
von Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to run for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead goes ahead of S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic elec@@ tors see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure has dropped from 78 percent over the last month .
bi@@ des are by far a second at this measurement , but the percentage that looks at him as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has increased .
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call for questions about eligi@@ bility .
similar to last month , not a single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these elec@@ tors stands out as unacceptable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results on some important characteristics in voters of the prim@@ aries of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den is best cut in hon@@ esty in the three candidates , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no idea of it .
in general , democratic elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
with all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic constitu@@ ents have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server during the term as foreign minister continue to be asked , most Democratic voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions were not affected altogether .
but it &apos;s a different story in the American public overall .
now half of the Americans are unhappy with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans have said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion had worsen@@ ed .
it is mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse .
although Clinton is regarded as honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of eligible voters do not consider it an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of the eligible voters are also seeing Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
however , Clinton and Tr@@ ump receive good lead notes .
out of the six tested candidates Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush get the best out of hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders to be honest , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the prim@@ aries is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son approaches Donald Tr@@ ump in a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is close behind Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times survey
in the meantime , half of the vot@@ er &apos;s support in the new pol@@ l is om@@ itted , and others are losing a dramatic footh@@ old .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large number . the support grows from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son fell from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and has out@@ performed pumping under repub@@ li@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated with Wis@@ con@@ sin &apos;s Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell at the bottom of 10 % support in the last month to now 2 % .
the former Gover@@ nor of Florida , J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place .
the margin of error in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son is in the poll@@ s - with 19 % support among the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey by ABC News / Washington Post also clearly showed Tr@@ ump ahead of Car@@ son .
looking at a Car@@ son rising in the past week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon himself , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question the umps of faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday during a campaign performance in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the Eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers already have a trip to the Mediterranean to find warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people don &apos;t go to the sea anymore : the water has a maximum of 18 degrees in the North Sea and Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) .
on the other hand , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean Sea : in the east , it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic Sea it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt reaches 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College &apos;s no@@ vice
almost two years after a student died during a religious ritual of a student relationship in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , mur@@ ders were filed against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g brut@@ ally during an introduction ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death .
officials said he was charged with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound ru@@ cksack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while he tried to go over a frozen field to a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about headaches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ fully and waited for an hour before bringing him to a hospital , so the police .
but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice , said Police Chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide U@@ ten@@ sils and basically put the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood through Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ gra@@ ef Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added with bl@@ unt force injuries to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; too many families have been destroyed by the har@@ ass@@ ment of the Brotherhood . at least one student died in the ch@@ ic@@ ans every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s family in a statement .
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment concerning murder of the third degree for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of har@@ ass@@ uring attacks and the formation of a criminal organisation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that has - official or in@@ official - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold them accoun@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College has forbidden the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rise in interest is coming , and the domestic market is going to be bank@@ rupt , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into a recession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy provides little guidance to the process .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest rate and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial systems react .
so representatives of the US Central Bank have so sharply stressed that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather to the period needed for normal@@ isation .
indeed , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could find that all excitement was possibly over@@ stated due to a rise in interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is in@@ vari@@ ably interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights but still to a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no re@@ perc@@ ussions .
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rate increases can make things volatile for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is apparently a tendency that assets will be ero@@ ded 12 to 24 months after the first raise , which may reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happened after the F@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest rate increases &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , the market in the past 35 years is usually in upward trend - approximately 14 percent - on the way to interest rate , rather flat in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , then return to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , published by Bob D@@ oll , chief asset strate@@ gi@@ sts at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares ten@@ dered later in the growth cycle and the return begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often encourage them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that did not exist before and could speed up a recession .
remarkably , the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the rate of interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank 118 interest rates since 1950 had only twice nominal GDP below 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest rates in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whe@@ ther this time is different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the year &apos;s net interest rates rose year @-@ round , and all eyes were on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading only has a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all increase cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sional heights were quickly put into shadow after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months .
fixed income was also volatile , as the market anticip@@ ates a rise in interest rates and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in equi@@ ties when they change their strategic direction .
in bonds the yields seem to change direction as soon as the first raise / reduction in the cycle takes place .
at the end of the raising cycle , the bond yields immediately fall , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will cause returns between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
it is interesting that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , lending margins have expanded and volati@@ lity has increased - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tened its strategy .
in large and large , companies that handle the greater part of their business activities in the US will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational corporations with high debts will get worse as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after initial interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analy@@ st in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed on average 5 percentage points after each of the Inter@@ est In@@ cre@@ ases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a big problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
outside the pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; savers could see profits through higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are how fast it will take place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Parliament member Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of Parliament critic@@ ised the station for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ishable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also referred to the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins gra@@ bbed the voice of The Voice and said this was not very original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says a leading Member of Parliament and raises new pressure on the station to prove that he does something that the private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D MEP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name .
so , if you are trying to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ General Director dismissed the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far from its commercial competi@@ tor when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn anywhere else about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to commission new works , I really think it is important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued harder to engage the audience than it did in the past , because the British are less informed about classical music .
however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sport was under fire to tread the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
T@@ ory de@@ pu@@ ties Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins gra@@ bbed The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , bought by Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of ¬£ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in special BBC manner &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wants the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house barn &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if the next time it starts a series of entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from further ranks of The Voice in the future , or to spend money on the fees for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales increased slow@@ est in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed down the issues in November
for over a decade , virtual shopping has bo@@ oted , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
but experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure on August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers only showed 7 percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian .
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases using their mobile phone purchases .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this comm@@ utes , and we may experience that growth will decrease .
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is quoted as a reason for the decline in revenues .
experts believe that buyers will hold back their purchases in front of this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites fell off .
experts believe that Black Friday , on which the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that out of ¬£ 5 was spent a little over ¬£ 1 online .
in some products such as television and washing machines , more than a third of the gro@@ c@@ eries are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothing and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident Get@@ ting - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first funeral par@@ ables in Mec@@ ca by the streets .
Saudi Arabia lays down the collapse of some of the huge Saudi Bin Laden &apos;s Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed when a crane collap@@ sed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mo@@ sch@@ ee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mour@@ ning filled , dressed largely in white , the track to pay their respect when the first of the dead appeared their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the procession passed on to the Holy site , where only days before a building crane had fallen through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the worshi@@ ppers .
the bodies were approved for the funeral , when the Saudi king handed over the family bin Laden &apos;s construction company because of the disaster that left 3@@ 94 injured , a san@@ ction .
the bodies of 29 pil@@ es killed when a crane collap@@ sed by the Great Central mo@@ sch@@ ee Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage , was promoted as the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents at the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officers have already stated that the p@@ add@@ an will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
king Sal@@ man said today that the Bin Laden group should not have stopped the arm of the crane than it was not used .
an Arab version of the decree published by the state @-@ owned Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was in charge of the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad was prohibited .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which pl@@ ung@@ ed into an inner courtyard of the Grand mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ an who later took place this month .
the Bin Laden Group has issued no statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a comment .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also rebu@@ ked the group because of not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes are surrounded by Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project managed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been connected to the royal family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over larger construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the crash of the crane was in the midst of strong winds and rain , just a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said that 15@@ 8 people remain hospit@@ alized .
government officials stated that 1 million Ri@@ al ( ¬£ 17@@ 4,000 ) must be paid to the members of the killed and the same amount is permanently injured .
other injured receive half of this amount .
boss says that the time of cheap East European craftsmen is over
British employ more and more arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has seen a rise
this leads to the opening of 200 new Scre@@ w@@ fix stores aimed at professional tra@@ des@@ people
at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher 60 B &amp; Q stores nationwide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Head of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that Br@@ its lay down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of skilled Eastern European craftsmen who carry out the work in their home .
if you can deal with a hammer or a brush for painting walls , you seem to belong to a minority nowadays .
the British employ increasingly skilled workers to perform do @-@ it @-@ your@@ sel@@ fers jobs in their homes , such as the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q .
V√©@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , the new Managing Director of King@@ f@@ isher who owns the Bau@@ markt chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe that offer services at low prices is now obsol@@ ete .
for this reason , King@@ f@@ isher is planning to open 200 new Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that are aimed at professional tra@@ des@@ people and to close 60 outlets of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are met by women .
at the moment the men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to address the growing demographic trends that show more female single households which perform more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it still works a majority of men in our stores . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to move this stronger towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions about buying articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British UK &apos;s FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that has owned 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial board .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales , after the Group bl@@ amed the cost of closing the shops .
because of the trend , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob on account of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball vice master A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and ev@@ asion .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of office .
he was legally acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial was postpon@@ ed .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney @-@ General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the preliminary investigation cryst@@ alli@@ zed that the defend@@ ants in the years 2006 to 2011 used mon@@ ies of association accounts , about which they could disp@@ ose in their functions , used for private purposes .
the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros .
sports officials are also accused of financial off@@ ences .
this fact was taken over by the chair@@ woman of the Sch@@ √∂ff@@ en@@ sen@@ at , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
for the sake of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that at no time the association had created an item of wealth .
the sports officials had only charged expenses and the sports club for which they had been operating from 1982 to 2011 and in which they invested a lot of time and money from debt - the liabilities tot@@ alled around 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 EUR ) .
&quot; at that time we were faced with the situation : are we carrying on or blocking the club ? &quot; said one of the defend@@ ants , in the bread profession of major financial institutions .
with his colleagues and co @-@ defend@@ ants he then decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , put our life insur@@ ances as security on the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said when he was arrested . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , there are no debts to be made .
furthermore , in case of a corresponding financial success , the reimbur@@ sement of expenses for reimbur@@ sement of expenses had been resolved retro@@ spec@@ tively by 1991 .
that is why one has paid off a part of the reimbur@@ sement damages only years later , namely from 2003 when a plus on the account has been paid off .
therefore also l@@ ump @-@ sum and not detail @-@ bookings appeared , the former Ob@@ server explained the occur@@ ren@@ ces .
the accounts and books administered the two defend@@ ants together , said the second defend@@ ant .
the judge asked why the expenses to the association were not disclosed in detail .
the association did not care in detail for the financial burden , it was important to have only the freedom of debt , the answer .
when , in 2011 , against the one function@@ ary investigation due to abuse of office , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
these were appropri@@ ations , declared the defend@@ ants .
this securities account was based on the name of the second defend@@ ant and , according to his statement , was not known to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know the answer for a long time .
then he said he thought that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known something of that money , the prosec@@ utor put in the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claims for damage &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why in@@ dem@@ n@@ ity ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
the first defend@@ ant stated that he did not agree with this wor@@ ding , because the association had never been damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this you are all from the cutter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary told him that he has never taken a cent salary , he only calcul@@ ates mil@@ eage and di@@ eting .
he added 1,000 euros per month to the association , but the actual effort had been much higher , he added .
the indic@@ te@@ es were not able to show accurate records for the early years .
these were no longer maintained after an operational test in which everything was judged correctly , they declared .
the second defend@@ ant also received kilomet@@ ric money .
all the changes were made in cash , and he said in his statement from his home town of the international market to the bank to Blei@@ burg .
the main trial will be continued on 23 September with the interro@@ gation of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Exp@@ ands More 30,000 Jobs
in addition to the workforce reduction that has been running for three years , the computer giant will reduce further jobs when it spl@@ its up the company .
the positions at the US computer giant H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) do not end .
within the framework of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to cut down 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer division .
as a result , costs tot@@ aling EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special charge of around $ 2.7 billion that will fall from the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 5@@ 5.000 jobs , which has been running for three years , has not yet been completed .
at the end of fiscal 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 associates .
on the stock exchange , the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard share delivered 2.3 percent .
the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto , which has become large @-@ scale printers , is currently split up : the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led in a new company , separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business segments are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales , as well as a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services , last recently accounted for the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
thus revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responds with spl@@ itting up and massive sub@@ missions to change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only responded late to the fact that customers increasingly purchase smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and do more and more business online .
in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age the reduction of approximately 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
however , a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would predominantly result in rejection : 54 per cent said , on the other hand , 35 percent expressed themselves appro@@ v@@ ingly .
the fact that other countries are flying air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive .
24 percent are opposed to interven@@ ing in the conflict .
a co @-@ operation with Syrian authorities , Bach@@ ar el @-@ Assad , reject 51 percent of the respon@@ dents , and 20 percent would be responsible for this .
29 per cent could not decide .
car : second day of the press at 6@@ 6th IA@@ A
at the centre of the fair stand up to 27 September connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and electric mobility .
after two days of press conference , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Automobile Exhibition under the slogan &quot; Mobility Connect &quot; on Thursday .
the wide public can attend the IA@@ A from Saturday .
the organisers of the Auto @-@ Verband V@@ DA expect about 900 000 visitors two years ago .
R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke : violence erup@@ tion in Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police used the Serbian border with R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke tear gas and water laun@@ chers against several hundred refugees .
Euron@@ ews @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ √°@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed a breach of violence at the border control point .
he reported on the phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it was a police line formed and behind the polic@@ emen was a water lamp ready .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officers initially stopped using pepper spray .
after that , the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have waited for a while now .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
children , who inhal@@ ed the tear gas , cried out .
other refugees gathered together and suffered under short@@ ness of breath .
the press spokes@@ men of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by using tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
the world ob@@ serves when the US central bank is coming together on two days , Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest is raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , the last week of the view that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and will keep interest rates on the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest rate was on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Chief Operating Officer at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global conditions .
it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds against such a step are good .
the decision should be announced at 20.@@ 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
Delta State University De@@ aths Trans@@ mitted L@@ etter of Sor@@ ts
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot and killed his colleagues on the day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to tell him that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; the authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer in ge@@ ography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He has shot on someone and killed one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb said to the staff of the emergency call centre that police must send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cute dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers for his name , but he didn &apos;t give him .
Lamb did not give any explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice from Lamb , 45 , saying , &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted , I could undo it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb went 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen were ring@@ ing him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , which supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , officials said on Tuesday that there was &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said she was married for about seven years , as a &quot; good person . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said Pr@@ enti@@ ss &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I telep@@ hon@@ ed relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t go to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a polic@@ eman took him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , he drove his car to the side , fled on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
in the spring of 2015 , Lamb received a doc@@ torate from the Delta State University , as his life @-@ law ad@@ mits to the University &apos;s website .

Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa is expanding the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large group restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year with a better organisation .
150 of the around 1,000 leaders around the world will cost the workplace .
however , there are new negotiations with the pilot union .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and upgrading the cheap Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment was to generate a profit contribution of some 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , announced the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa will not be a member of the board of directors for the passenger business in the future .
the airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
in the future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the executive board of chief Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr .
the new order under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in future .
up to now , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex .
the airlines operated under the roof of the airline Air@@ line Group , which accounts for three quarters of the annual turnover of ‚Ç¨ 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the tari@@ ff conflict with the Pilot Factory Cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations will be resum@@ ed after the court @-@ based strike on Thursday .
that divided the union .
the topic of conversations shall be the retirement regulation for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a projected record result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wants to achieve faster results as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and the airline led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the background is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ par@@ ag@@ us concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it seems that Lufthansa in the fight against competitors travels to the company &apos;s own cheap Eu@@ row@@ ings line .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United won &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Manchester &apos;s Champions League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
while this brought the left outside def@@ enders to cry and will be excluded from playing for at least six months , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w will be able to play again this season .
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by H@@ √©@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w broke into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg size and lies in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , has very hard and then plays fantas@@ tically , and then that happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture then it will take six months and will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno was happy to have escaped a red card and the im@@ position of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , did not punish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbit@@ er had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself when I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a tweet on Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
related to : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in defeat at PS@@ V
the UK distributor has an additional incentive to recover until the coming June with the European Championship in France .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player with this type of injury leaves the place , all are very sad about it .
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al as the Netherlands team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very hard , because it wasn &apos;t his intention to hurt his opponent , and if you then hear that it is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .

surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax , who was published in 1971 , decided Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read to my children , because it always seems to give a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is pur@@ port@@ edly describing the plot of the book , re@@ prints a summary of the 2012 film version , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; in the heart of the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams , &quot; reads .
as if it wasn &apos;t yet suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron reads partly like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
even though he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the plot of the book . here , an un@@ named boy , like the local environment , will be rav@@ aged by the gre@@ edy , trees f@@ ading , th@@ ump@@ ing natur@@ es , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; despite the protests of the name @-@ giving Lor@@ ax .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task has been deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row .
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s election circuit .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s employees , but no further direct comments were made .
Adam Ly@@ re was clearly under threat from the exclusion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult
hitting Pakistan in the U@@ AE is a difficult task , but when one sees the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I wouldn &apos;t finish an out@@ going victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not carry sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown quantity at test level , is an option for the attack .
related news : Adam Ly@@ th is out of the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th , of course , is hard to analyse for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
in his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results .
there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best sel@@ ections .
long ago , the course of ly@@ th could have been extended , but he had control over his own destiny .
hopefully , if it kno@@ cks out further bor@@ ou@@ ghs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes .
the England coach Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss thank@@ ed his attitude even if he did not get such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team @-@ man .
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to put his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ re got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick comp@@ ton received nine .
only comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first used Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer that I set up high .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which hit us a lot .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this naturally depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to make Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and get four Qui@@ cks , emerged , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t strike there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s pole of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ que may not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop , before he joined the op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred r@@ ents immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a punch , but there is no big number of backup spi@@ ders who raise their hands and the trainers decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some smart additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful application to the setup .
I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela , he has insights from which we can profit .
sometimes new voices in the locker room can bring fresh breeze even if the messages are in accordance with what has been said before .
Coll@@ i &apos;s te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ downs , R@@ oot got a similar break from Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some won &apos;t agree , but coaches and team rank@@ ings don &apos;t determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy .

we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Minister of Finance are climbing at summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , making a photo of himself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care if we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her , as in the exagger@@ ated long endurance like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s Fran√ßois Hollande faces his re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right @-@ wing government , Spain a left .
it is hard to imagine that they will be ri@@ pping a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Brit@@ ons whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they do not want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore some such ministers may even deliberately refrain from helpful ann@@ ot@@ ations , entirely in the SN@@ P style , while the UK &apos;s refer@@ en@@ dium campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process susp@@ ects my boy@@ friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and what EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they did during the referendum in 1975 by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our admission 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can weak@@ ly remember Boris Johnson , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opport@@ uni@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who made himself a name as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 1990s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were with all his ma@@ dness .
this included the Med@@ ley of Tax @-@ fear@@ ing Sch@@ ur@@ ks , telephone @-@ hack@@ ers , and the pseu@@ do @-@ non @-@ nationals who have most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir actually thought about her , but found that when sitting with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , one better distri@@ butes ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of going to his lunch and dinner .
in fact Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir himself than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum vor@@ tex , because Bla@@ ir had the principle of the un@@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly ch@@ aps on the back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he no longer need to waste me - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 1980s , an error at that time and today .
it may take but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ Sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position in Europe - I express it friendly - in the development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ ant tendency and the wild gra@@ dient of Tor@@ y &apos;s Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ man can say yes to everyone .
it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV said this week , when the boy Sc@@ out fought in him , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues without going too far and losing his Cab@@ inet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; remain &quot; under all circumstances - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports at their conference evening on Monday evening .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he has stir@@ red me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s right not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe that allows him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the refer@@ ral campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks like that .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s basic ambig@@ u@@ ities to EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dissi@@ dents , for whom the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic differences .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato , Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to leave - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - to make concessions to the British when all this can be point@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military capacity in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded when I started on Monday by something British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum called .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health England report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts , who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , concluded Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic Law Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month gra@@ bbed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extremely wind@@ y foundation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which P@@ he substanti@@ ated his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public expects that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people called to develop a model for multi @-@ criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to make their opinions about the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were sum@@ mar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously been received by British American Tob@@ acco means ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting announced to receive funding from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding it was supposed to have received from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International in advance .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the board are not supplied , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which include a sector funding in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
the meeting also took part in the tobacco leadership of P@@ he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group &apos;s research work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acknow@@ le@@ dges &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for most products damage to most criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or limitations will be discussed in the P@@ he Report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; serving &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a way of smoking for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims had already been re@@ acted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are considerably less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
he has the un@@ ambig@@ uous obligation to inform the public about what proves evidence and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative haz@@ ards compared to tobacco .
almost 80@@ ,000 people die every year in a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs the National healthcare system two billion pounds per year .
by clearly showing current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ on , says former boss of Channel 4
the former leader of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programmes like East@@ er and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK stations .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs likely to be seen by a smaller public in hard @-@ controversial tim@@ pan@@ es against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and stations such as BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he had been trying to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes are commissioned or sent , which would also be clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson in his investigation on the future of BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , what I don &apos;t think for a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least rely on programs that others don &apos;t do or contract .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve the wi@@ dest possible support for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s of course non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax program is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ er is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I would like to see how this is supposed to be public television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts are what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 , that BBC shows like East@@ ers should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal ni@@ ches should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they can argue if they go to their apparent missions to justify up to $ 4 billion , &quot; Well , of course , we &apos;ve created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the committee on the broadcast fee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I call you to find a more reg@@ ression system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course you all think we all think that you get a great value for ¬£ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for the ¬£ 150 , ask me if this is true , because they do not consume much from the BBC .
former head of the SK@@ Y@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check their rei@@ thi@@ an mission , &quot; educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate , and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC production would be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example in &quot; inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain &quot; the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada .
to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of tel@@ ev@@ isions are shown , and with commercial channels to make alliances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems , which can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment when they are radi@@ ated with sound pulses , which have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the stimul@@ i work by switching on mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure , called Son@@ o@@ genetics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , Res@@ ear@@ cher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that the method of a day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
th@@ read@@ worms generally do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid containing micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 I@@ on channels and found in the membranes of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these I@@ on channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned , such as a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani has genetically modified the worms that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 I@@ on channels .
when he applies ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ ves@@ icles and transferred into the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the method has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground @-@ breaking tool which enables scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics may have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that needs to be sent down to the desired position in the brain at an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

one of the par@@ o@@ dy advertisements produced by Special Pat@@ rol Group .
according to Gav@@ in Gr@@ ind@@ on , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol Designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists become more critical and try to bring political work to the public outside of galleries .
many artists turn to work with activists within protest movements and notice that they must go out into the real world , so that their art has an impact on society .

V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around advertising for the Ce@@ ase@@ fire - by a legend of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought , &quot; Let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic cy@@ ber company advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the blu@@ ei@@ sh with bright colors and animation , it remains sti@@ ffer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we need now is a step in the British government and the guarantee that torture instruments are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our front door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the most creative art around the ce@@ ase@@ fire comes from the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors are fantas@@ tically bl@@ ending eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; uniquely shaped &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bra@@ id that delivers outstanding reflection effects inside the target . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student resi@@ dences
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved to a student residence , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral Rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those whom I anger@@ ed - and at the numerous , long @-@ lasting complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entrance to student resi@@ dences ranges from slightly ner@@ ven@@ tively to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to sh@@ at@@ y : people tell where you come from and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ year , where you stand in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those that you would not talk to , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
leave people .
people often transform themselves into drinks reception , film night venues and local meeting points , but they are also places where people dressed up and under@@ wear their under@@ wear .
referring to this : don &apos;t remember to start a relationship at university
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge but many student resi@@ dences are a space @-@ to @-@ space b@@ um@@ mel culture that can be friendly and social and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I can get back the energy that I have spent on interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a milit@@ ant of convi@@ vi@@ ality is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos anch@@ oring : do it .
a guy in my student resi@@ dences had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friend@@ ships close through che@@ eks .
since you begin the university at the climax of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ ck on the doors of people to imagine yourself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I &apos;ve baked something for you . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain yourself and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
badly mixed l@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat cause people to sleep when you kno@@ ck .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of sp@@ le@@ en for your tea also ?
check this with the milk owner .
chances are good that they say to use themselves even when they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it more balanced than my room@@ mate who added a dish@@ washing agent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
it is not just about being a decent person , but that you belong in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb to the people sitting in the glass @-@ house .
a girl on my corridor asked her neighbors , whether it was something to make them a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more lou@@ der music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbours to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut her door and went to her three hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would accidentally move into the same student residence ?
on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be too aw@@ k@@ ward embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future spouse , take care of them , get rid of them , and then see them every day and maybe experience how they are heading towards each other together ?
of course the heart goes its own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your subordin@@ ate a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has left its key in its not closed room , the border between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ bbing is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good sweep is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never forget someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and put your keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but don &apos;t t@@ ack your holding on the ceiling more than twice .
town@@ houses for refugees , single @-@ parents , low @-@ wage ear@@ ners
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ ler is building terra@@ ced houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus for example for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living space , but also the single @-@ educ@@ ating mother and the low @-@ ear@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build affordable and well today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will rush to the housing market .
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly the affordable housing can be created : it builds town@@ houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Gil@@ ler , many refugees will be pushing for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Markus Gil@@ ler : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mass storage in containers or gym@@ nasi@@ ums has no sustainability . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the people remain a great deal here .
in view of the flood of refugees , we need sufficient living space in the coming decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
guil@@ der : a terra@@ ced house needs least space .
it makes integration easier .
this is different if people are living in blocks of housing .
each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge .
it can be that many refugees say that it is peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
guil@@ der : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 euros , without land .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
do building regulations have complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ ler : I have dra@@ gged my project correctly .
especially complicated it always makes the threatening Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the parking ordin@@ ance .
sp@@ ook@@ y .
it is still under@@ estimated who in a terra@@ ced house creates three apartments , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities there is a lack of space .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the residents respond to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ ler : there were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
which is definitely not true .
but do you not tigh@@ ten the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ ler : it &apos;s true : over the last five years we had a construction boom in Germany , but we built luxury apartments , which can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees but also the educ@@ ating mother or the low @-@ ear@@ ner .
I &apos;ll show you how to build affordable and well today .
that is why it is all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setup app , click &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it &apos;s ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after installation , because they get an error message telling that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or try to update via iTunes .
the telephone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able through the stream@@ lining of the update . similarly , it will be easier to do this by using a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worth to ensure that your mobile phone is charged while updating or is located near a charger so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued , as the phone may switch to half way and this may lead to a break@@ out of the update .

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s sole motto : full attack
in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton , N@@ ico Ros@@ berg only knows a motto : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup second stressed before the start into the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the runner @-@ up champion before the night race in Singapore on this Sunday from tit@@ le@@ holder and two @-@ way champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on already won seven of the twelve races of the season and takes the floo@@ d@@ light Grand Prix in the City State as a favourite .
in 2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Brit@@ on was able to win the race .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will influence the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; founded three months ago has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed for over 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz 1 . class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ √ºb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation , which President Alfred Klein received .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot collect the membership fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent search should also be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is seen as an expression of its solidarity with the spa town . &quot; &quot; &quot;
district Office looking for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the elderly care centre Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined together under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened up a new contact point at Count @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg Square .
in addition to consultations you can also take part in courses .
the social foundation draws it down from the mountain to the city centre .
more specifically to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was opened there recently .
here , immediately next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and counsel@@ ors will receive information on questions such as care insurance or health and care insurance services .
for years we have been working with our ambul@@ ant care service to ensure that nur@@ turing relatives are often left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not in@@ frequently many services of the insurance companies are not used because the complexity of insurance is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new landlord Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ appliance and the citizen &apos;s hospital as well as for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health and wellness .
for this purpose the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as prevention prevention , memory training or a physi@@ o@@ therapeutic treatment can be used .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , provision and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
both business executives see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre particularly in the demographic change .
this necess@@ it@@ ates a good decentr@@ alised infrastructure in the individual parts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , as mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations , the district office also devoted itself to the agreement with age : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ able soci@@ alizing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this makes the social foundation a big contribution for sen@@ iors to be able to live independently and well in their familiar environment .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 : 00 to 18 : 00 and Saturday from 10 : 00 to 12 : 00 .

rebu@@ ke : Tim Wiese is throwing polic@@ ew@@ oman with money
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ex @-@ foot@@ ball@@ ers Tim Wiese is dis@@ liked in Bremen &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
foot@@ ball@@ ers once , meanwhile , Tim Wiese , former Nation@@ alt@@ or@@ h√º@@ ter in Germany and at Bremen and H@@ offen@@ heim are engaged , W@@ rest@@ ler .
according to his own statement , he wants to have laid 30 kilograms of muscle mass over the past two years .
on the other hand , he has not attributed intellectu@@ ally .
Wiese was just cutting his hair in the city &apos;s inner city when he saw a parking space guar@@ dian issued a ticket for his white Chev@@ ro@@ let Cam@@ aro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , Wiese was stor@@ ming from the business , insul@@ ted the be@@ amer and threw her the fake fine in front of her feet , as reported in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Image &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the city of Bremen , one confirms the accus@@ ations , but is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only then will it be decided whether meadow will be displayed , or not .

men beating a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ m√ºn@@ ster : on Friday evening , around 23.@@ 45 , three young men were on the way from Bad So@@ den to Sal@@ m√ºn@@ ster .
one of the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an , followed the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was at the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the site of the gas station .
one of these men now cried out to the young man and struck him with his fist .
the victim suffered a nose @-@ bone and bleeding heavily from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the thu@@ gs , he first left off his victim .
the injured young man was brought home by his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car up to their apartment and passed through demonstr@@ atively several times .
when you didn &apos;t see the car any more , the injured person went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the m@@ allet and another male person .
the victim &apos;s face and thi@@ ghs checked the victim &apos;s face with the help of a dr@@ um@@ stick .
the injured person had to be hospit@@ alized for medical treatment .
so far , only a vag@@ ue perpetr@@ ator &apos;s description lies ahead .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters tall .
the second m@@ allet should have been about 1.@@ 65 feet tall and was clothed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police ask witnesses and instructions to report on the phone number 06@@ 18@@ 1 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank M√ºller to acquire field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank M√ºller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ den@@ ausen .
the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , business promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also looking forward to this .
in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing : Dr. Frank M√ºller takes over the practice Fel@@ den@@ ausen on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ den@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on his way to his successor in the coming months .
after a reconstruction phase M√ºller will open the practice on October 12 , until then he will invest EUR 3@@ 10@@ 000 in the premises on the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ stra√üe 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight , when the ri@@ ms met Frank M√ºller and his wife Dr. Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l who are currently completing their specialist training in the Ver@@ den hospital and who also wants to enter into practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mil@@ ler would fit into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ den@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I was so far , I just called her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the future , the couple M√ºller liked the idea of running their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old mil@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage he also sees his own boss soon .
and so it was agreed that the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with the practice .
however , they continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there , the two @-@ time father Frank M√ºller was also raised , his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several medical practices and in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as Senior Consul@@ tant in Sul@@ ingen . in 2009 he was appointed senior emergency doctor in Di@@ ep@@ holz and is involved in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the practice will be prepared for the new boss as of September 19 .
during the surgeon Dr Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ den@@ ausen works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ ist ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the mil@@ ler , both inter@@ ne@@ es , want to settle down as home doctors .
&quot; the endos@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l .
after the conversion , the rooms look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a total of 50@@ 000 Euros will be allocated to the mil@@ ler within the scope of a funding program from the administrative district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes Sam@@ vet Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2,000 patients come to the field of field breaks in every quarter , in the northern German average practice it is approximately 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another GP practice .
a positive side effect of the practical acquisition by Frank M√ºller : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ den@@ ausen .
if no successor was found , it would have gone too .
those who attend M√ºll@@ ers &quot; consultations are still looking at familiar faces : take over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning lady from the fields of the field .
with their departure in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all the doctors have practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ur@@ sel Fel@@ thouse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they feel a little melanch@@ oly after the long time already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will surely see many patients more often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the journalist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pressed myself before gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also raised at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the controls at the Hungarian border are maintained parallel to this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear that everyone who wants to put an asylum claim can do so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people stand in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , nor about the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses
the Croatian government had previously announced that also Slovenia wants to leave the incoming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and under certain circumstances establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
so the Minister of the Interior , Ves@@ na Gy@@ √∂r@@ k√∂@@ s Z@@ no@@ dar , did not see this in Lai@@ bach though .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - above all to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by contrast , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the boundary of the Schengen area .
as the minister pointed out , Sloven@@ ians does not want to dis@@ assemble his borders for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill out its commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ √∂r@@ k√∂@@ s Z@@ no@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like the Croatian government , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours on Tuesday to leave in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid registration .
the c@@ roati@@ an police could pick them up in the nearby fields of corn .
according to local media ever police vehicles with new refugees arrive in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in operation .
in the coming days , his country accounts for about 4,000 refugees , said Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were diver@@ ting Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it was possible for people to adopt certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do so , &quot; he said .
according to the media reports , in the morning , a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses were expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were on the way through Serbia all night long from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border around 500 kilometers away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary joined , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could actually lead to a somewhat further west stretch of the former Balkan Route between Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary , already forec@@ asted by observers .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive border control capabilities &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic stressed that his country had prepared corresponding plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not refer to details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive options for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strict controls are carried out in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , and since then the EU partners have consistently issued a good testimony regarding the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side there are about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Minister of the Interior , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic , still tried to calm the debate on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not be about very high quantities of refugees at this time .
one could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian Refu@@ ge@@ ants have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe : in parts of the border area there are still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields for 20 years after the end of the Croatian war .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .
stock H@@ acker : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard a ring of cy@@ ber criminal that has been accused of having gained an insight into un@@ published financial statements and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the information captured , insi@@ der transactions should have been made on the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , a total of over 100 million dollars were launched to the investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated in the SE@@ C message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trial against 32 other defend@@ ants in the case continued .
most of the defend@@ ants are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators should have acted in both the US and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
there is a lively operation around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz .

they control the two stations of the Mannheim &apos;s aut@@ os@@ al@@ on@@ am at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep city tracks down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; puls@@ ating , boun@@ cing life with wonderful autumn sunlight and in the midst of four big boards each with the heading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Before I die I want to .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce has drawn attention to its 20th anniversary with this action and is quite confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we &apos;ve gone through the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Help is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and discussions like the volunteers .
while some p@@ asser@@ by spontaneously resorts to the chal@@ k and completes the sentence about &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; stopping the war &quot; or &quot; not suffering long , &quot; others will be short , read , say phrases like &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and go on .
again and again on the br@@ ink there are small discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with the dying .
Peter H@@ √ºb@@ inger is also on the spot .
&quot; only when I realize that for me eventually comes the end of this world , I can live responsible , &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onian work Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband sponsors of ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce assistance .
therefore , this public @-@ effective action for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good .
the fact that not everyone wants to communicate openly on the boards , is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing .
the subject of death and dying may still be frau@@ ght with tab@@ oos , such as the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , even though the Hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed a lot to the opening up of people .
an app@@ rais@@ al that An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid shares .
the death and mour@@ ning accompan@@ ist is one of the volunteers of the first hour .
confronted by personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce was called for by calling on volunteers , she was immediately reported to have been involved in the formation in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and their relatives in private homes , hospitals , nursing homes and in the hos@@ pi@@ ce Saint Vincent .
they are all carefully trained .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid can deal well with her task and the experiences and experiences he has made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another war@@ ts , keep it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of ambul@@ ant ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insurance funds and donations from relatives and associations allows the training as well as further training and supervision of the death and mour@@ ners .
training sessions for new employees are offered every two years .
the pla@@ ques described on Saturday are now displayed in the House of the Evangel@@ ical Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) .

F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the delivery giant has lowered its profit prospects for a whole year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its bo@@ d@@ land transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for their holidays .
at that time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to recru@@ it 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by more than 2.5 percent in the after@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said earning a profit between 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the fiscal year ending in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous pre@@ diction .
according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set , analysts expected a $ 10,@@ 84 million survey .
the lower outlook , despite the price increases , is 4.@@ 9 per cent on average and will take effect on 4 January and despite higher allow@@ ances for bo@@ d@@ land transport of heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result would increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and because of growth in online trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company is considering &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid earnings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , which plans to adjust 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , for example the same number as last year .
in the first quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just below $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which predicted twelve analysts from Z@@ ack Investment Research .
sales rose by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six analy@@ st surv@@ eyed by Z@@ ack expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
over the past few years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , bringing sales in its unit express delivery to stagn@@ ation .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , bo@@ d@@ ging sales increased 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result fell due to higher labour costs in the freight business .
in the after@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
at its most expected conference in the year Federal Reserve Strate@@ gies are spending two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to raise the body for the first time for almost a decade .
threatening over them at an end of the decorated two @-@ storey meeting hall is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed chair@@ person Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the nation &apos;s economic interests ahead of all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold order from Congress : maxim@@ ising US employment and prices here stable .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written Third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict . it will be announced on Thursday that the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented incentives by the close @-@ to @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data in the economy show that it grows soli@@ dly , the latest turbul@@ ence in the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives afraid to increase this volati@@ lity by raising interest for federal securities - and be it just a quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing to observe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , making the financial market uns@@ ett@@ led .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase in interest this week .
the financial markets , however , expect the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator that only shows a 30 % chance of up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment .
this indicates a drop in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mi@@ tig@@ ate the blow by promising that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her declaration to calm the financial markets so they won &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that increasing interest rate would calm the financial markets because they would remove uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
still a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the rate by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow intensi@@ fication of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the sentence was expected .
although the job creation slow@@ ed in August , the improvement in the labour market this year was solid .
the unemployment rate declined to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary impact of much lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chief Econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world came together at the end of last month , after China had vali@@ dated its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would ch@@ okes global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , and the Dow is now around 10 % below the high level of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation , when the interest should be increased .
&quot; if events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the past few weeks , they would tigh@@ ten the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US Federal Reserve .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the effects on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in its decision @-@ making technology .
but in the end the F@@ ed has become the F@@ ed Monetary Authority in the world .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
the mere hint of the former director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow down their monetary expansion , &quot; triggered del@@ u@@ sions around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , F@@ ed representatives can expect that they not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also seek advice with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA , re@@ marked this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that apparently are not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ ier , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which advoc@@ ates a rise in interest rate , quoted decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to lower their benchmark interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited noticeable effects on growth in the U.S. , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lack@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later , the F@@ ed representatives were revers@@ ing these cuts .
the F@@ ed should only place aspects of financial stability in the first place during a serious crisis such as the 2008 market collapse , said Adam S. P@@ osen , a former member of the Committee on Inter@@ est Det@@ er@@ mination of Bank of England .
the recent turbul@@ ence does not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she fears a rise in interest because the markets are upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until this is changed , I do not believe that it should ha@@ sten the time .

try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
yes , Chin@@ at@@ own
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Assistance for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
to give you a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine are among them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still loves to teach her 74 L@@ ess@@ ons .
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seekers home on the D@@ ill@@ inger Strasse .
there , she helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German .
of course , that &apos;s completely different than at a proper school .
Rio Grande Brazil &apos;s pedi@@ atric community promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS tries to educ@@ ate women in a sho@@ cking way to clarify how important good nutrition is during the lac@@ tation period . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who su@@ ck at breasts which are painted with portra@@ y@@ als of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should undertake .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new amber sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the building request for the 2.3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be flat for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ awaited turn@@ out on the Bern@@ ina sports grounds is progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent council session , the elabor@@ ated building application has been unanim@@ ously approved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; prior to that , among other things , the committee had approved an application for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the current construction plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with a top and roof top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be erected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through this we get together a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was again about the pitch of the roof , which for energy reasons - unlike in the construction plan - should lie under ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the construction plan has not allowed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the ti@@ lt of the roof - whereby the council of the municipal council usually proceeds more restric@@ tively in the case of liber@@ ating contracts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , this is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym@@ nasi@@ um building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
costs are estimated to be around 2.3 million euros .
subsidies are expected from school and mass sports promotion .
in the next process step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall will be presented to the Office of the Land@@ rats@@ amt ( Land@@ rats@@ amt ) .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the Hospital P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg is to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new Medical Director at Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of the staff move from P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , who confirmed the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü .
however , a decision is made by the Supervisory Board , and the meeting will be postpon@@ ed on Wednesday , 23 September .
should the plans be implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg would continue to work .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the still existing inside station .
the rooms are available .
employees who cannot come to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü .
the employees were informed of the plans .
the change of notice from Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year , has now changed to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play on the question of who should succeed him , who agreed to take the lead from 1 October and change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means an &quot; appreciation &quot; and a spread of the offer in the area of &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the inside station .
for the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees , will lead both houses until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ schaft , which has more than 35 beds , is to be closed permanently in P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , when the currently ongoing renovation at the hospital in Wei@@ l@@ heim was completed .
Coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , res@@ igned against rum@@ ours that the house , owned by the Federal Ar@@ med Forces , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I close it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü could not say that there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a day psychology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity will not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer on the quasi @-@ move to the Le@@ ch , which was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positively and very understandable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as head physician for more than 30 years has not been given .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
in the past decades , the P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg Hospital ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened with closure , detach@@ ments were closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .

hunting season with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their harvesting on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several hunters were in use as the police informed .
after a shot , an 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
at first it was not clear how exactly the accident could happen .
the police investig@@ ates the criminal police .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a crime suspect has led the police to the funeral of 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
in interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old gave up , killed youths and threw their bodies into a channel in Rock@@ house .
a 16 year old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who had been missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to violent crimes .
the cor@@ pse of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ h@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as the public prosec@@ utor and police told on Wednesday .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , also arrested on Tuesday evening , is considered to be a suspect , who , in fact , conf@@ essed the statement and led the investig@@ ators to the place of discovery of the cor@@ pse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she didn &apos;t come home as agreed on the evening after a visit of an autumn festival in Rock@@ house .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first encountered personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
during interro@@ gations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing persons , a crime suspicion was finally found against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ h@@ ausen , where the cor@@ pse was found .
the det@@ ain@@ ee told the authorities in the police interro@@ gation that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was killed and the cor@@ pse was placed in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be led to the port fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put an end to him .
the further investigation is intended to shed light on the actual circumstances of the act .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing space
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is faced with a challenge .
the distribution of distribution on the German housing market has long since begun .
with the incoming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a study commissioned by the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social H@@ ousing Building &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes to this conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison : in Germany , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished this year .
a total of 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial housing .
many then hit the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year .
the negative development of the housing market , however , is not only due to the rising number of refugees .
the study also makes considerable om@@ is@@ sions in the housing policy of recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany is moving an apartment deficit , increasing from year to year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present , around 77@@ ,000 units have already been missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Gu@@ en@@ ther , author of the study , compla@@ ins .
many professionals therefore lived in large cities into shared rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults remained un@@ tarily over the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the dol@@ drums on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita has declined again for the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a new start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , new incentives should stimulate social housing construction .
thus , the property tax tax could be wai@@ ved and the basic tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed apartments may be suspended for a limited time .
in addition , attractive fiscal write @-@ downs are necessary according to the alliance .
the funding programme for state bank Kf@@ W refugees is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the launch , more than half of the remaining 300 million euros had already been obtained on Monday evening with ‚Ç¨ 18@@ 4 million .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free access : Croatia and Slovenia align corridor
there is practically no access to Hungary , since more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia .
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the transit through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to the Sloven@@ ian Minister of the Interior , and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the deportation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border hundreds of refugees to Croatia broke out to escape from there to Western Europe .
500 people had come across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reported to the Croatian television station RT@@ L .
on the day of the day Hungary had sealed its border to refugees .
new laws that entered into force on the same day also necess@@ itate the need for proper asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic asser@@ ted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can go through , and we prepare ourselves for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
but they were people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the c@@ roati@@ an police picked up the first refugees at the Serbian border on the border of Serbia in the morning .
most of the reports were reported in Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they arrived with the bus as well as with taxis in the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not come across borders .
but the border strip poses other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mine clear@@ ers are now to quickly create a safe passage .
after Hungary , however , after the closure of the border no more refugees arrive .
on Tuesday , the police numbered 3@@ 66 .
shortly before closing on Monday it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws prescri@@ be overcoming and damaging the border between us as a crime .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the border town Sz@@ eg@@ ed in the south @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
prisoners sentenced to five years imprisonment and deportation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly established &quot; Tran@@ sit &quot; zones , of which almost all - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants were 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees there .
in practice , however , no one has a chance to grant asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up in R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the rub@@ b@@ ish which tens of thousands of people had left on the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
barriers were disman@@ tled and one of the detention centres in the border area was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to express themselves at the goal of this conversion .
after closing the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria only reached a few refugees .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
but around the 20,000 migrants , according to government information , they still remained in the country .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the continuation to Germany .
the train from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the instruction of German authorities .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees arrived on foot on a regular basis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mayor drove &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; str@@ and@@ ete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; across the border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the bridge festival on Sunday we were occupied with the clearing , when suddenly ten people were standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly set the rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the flood of refugees , it was at the end of W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; so Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the stu@@ ds together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border to the nearby Passa@@ u .
prior to that , we first used the unexpected guests , with snack and drinks .
we said right away , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ √ñ@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man refused to give a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers were switched to a regional train in W@@ els by an ICE on Sunday evening in a regional train direction to Passa@@ u . after the announcement that the railway traffic was set to Germany , it was still trying to cross the border .
but the regional train was placed at the Inn before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Br√º@@ cken@@ fest combined with Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably , days before a two @-@ brid@@ ling sport - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ √°n is sending more thousands of thousands to us is a logical result of hypo@@ critical policy :
instead of helping to establish structures in the R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke camp , our Chancellor has officially and publicly acknowledged the position of the Hungarian government in the sphere of national socialism .
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions in the bor@@ der@@ lands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even the refugees will have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yellow land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they invited and welcomed , is nothing but a further refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a major challenge in the face of the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter to produce decent conditions for protection @-@ seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be an even greater one - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad searching for 35@@ ,000 winter@@ ized Quar@@ ters
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the support of refugees , Konrad has to do all his hands full . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Konrad used to know that his word has a weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to place arti@@ llery for the thousands of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chaos in the first recording centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Con@@ rad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said of his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was also without great fuss , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master@@ stroke &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad reck@@ ons with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ igen year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodation units have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 should provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
should there be more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a bot@@ tom@@ less pit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the provincial govern@@ ors .
these would have assured him of creating quarters for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things are going well in Upper Austria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Sch√∂n@@ born , who will explain how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator sets high expectations also in the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Help like us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform private persons can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty during the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , it could not be that qu@@ arti@@ ers have to respect a certain amount of the towel rack or size of the sky@@ lights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply for a temporary period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Interior Ministry , he is more successful in accommodation , Konrad bases himself on his experience .
I am an older gentle@@ man , whom you do not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood .
the power of persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier are not responsible for the Republic as they themselves stated .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
up to now , the own quarter search has not been successful .
Konrad wanted to place a container on Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz demands a better distribution
for the time being , no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design center for refugees planning is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , as the victims are currently under way without these measures , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further sites are to be tested for their suit@@ ability .
the city chief has critic@@ ised the division of refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also contribute to this .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; boundaries are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ √ºhr@@ inger ( VP ) , on Monday , cor@@ ded the further action in the refugee issue .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders will not be smu@@ g@@ gled .
the continuation of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany .
however , the asylum seekers would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ √ºhr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria now carries out controls at its borders is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general restructuring of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new shi@@ py@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Linz industrial line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T is integrated , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square metres ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine investing in the startup companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard and later also to acquire them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - from which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
‚Ç¨ 1.7 million was invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the Federation ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is rented from Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 sq@@ .@@ m. remaining space in the building is already rented out , for another 40 percent there are inquiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second shop in the ar@@ cade
Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are the centre of attention in the new shop .
actually Jut@@ ta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
this project had to push the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the do@@ ve @-@ market ar@@ cade : after all , she now has an increase in the form of another business area .
in the Fur@@ la shop over the shop where they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes of various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags from the Fur@@ la brand , pur@@ ses are available from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories will cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks were rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long thought if I should still open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of an own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Linz Gro√ü@@ raum , who sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who have even Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her interest in fashion has been raised from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
I am deaf to the most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women when looking at a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , the expert can &apos;t answer with last certainty either .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag enhances every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter from K@@ all@@ stadt
the P@@ f√§l@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place named An@@ ders .
this feature also connects some to the billi@@ on@@ aire , who wants to become U.S. president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ setting .
whether he expresses himself in a foreign hos@@ tility , concerns journalists or gaps in knowledge in international crisis policies - the candidate for the U.S. presi@@ dency s@@ wir@@ ls the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cut it off well .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ √∂hn@@ fris@@ ur &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is well known in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine route . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant @-@ village is related to it over -@@ zig corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ st√§d@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the villa@@ gers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they somehow find it exciting but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter style , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ st√§d@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous children , to whom besides Tr@@ ump the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz matters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2014 ) , Tr@@ ump is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y - so with the statement that he would be successful even if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he didn &apos;t bring it to the king of his heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to think that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is already a bit a big mau@@ l , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is loud , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in High German : the investors , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the An@@ ders .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the corner@@ stone of the real estate company were first real estate purchases in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed at the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time .
he did not take up Tr@@ ump because he was once cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared the start of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal immig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the occasionally br@@ anded statements of the descend@@ ant .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the Polish , this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of the tr@@ ump ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The grand@@ ma was a native Tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the v@@ int@@ ner in retirement looks rather dist@@ anced to the American , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so start@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared for K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pen@@ sion@@ er Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions how many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters mention that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz with a visit ended a visit to the church organ , which was generally good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 68 @-@ year @-@ old says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be better if he didn &apos;t know the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like he , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;d never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ cher Sarah B√ºh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not my president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe even without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 movies , also in the USA aw@@ akes interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper Bavaria congregation of Ram@@ sau with Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the vice @-@ president &apos;s hand to the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 inhabitants of the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den national park received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday .
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; clim@@ ber villages . &quot;
in neighbouring countries , the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sunrise dominates the ratings , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son are moving to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there has not been much shifts in Today &apos;s ratings .
the breakfast show by N@@ ine was broadcast by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull made the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sunrise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a week @-@ long series of international television programmes including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the uprising did not seem to play a role for Australian TV viewers , as Sunrise achieved an average of 39@@ 7.@@ 000 viewers in the five capitals , compared with Today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today , Today achieved a slight increase in rating on Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , Today , the gap to Sunrise was closed .
in August today , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ 0.000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year the distance between 40.000 and 50.000 went away .
until now , sunrise is available on an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at Today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect these da@@ w@@ ns more than Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial production of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently wit@@ ched father , who decides to settle down with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the ra@@ fters star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening responded with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven stayed strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and easily hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5 : 30 p.m. ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe scored an average of 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ 000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia scored 5@@ 20,000 people and 7@@ 20,000 in the second half hour .
average 6@@ 20,000 hot @-@ seed .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ seed will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars a minute that didn &apos;t manage to over@@ run the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
mystery revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki have probably un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , at which Sam Wood finally landed in The Bachelor , was sh@@ rou@@ ded in greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who has received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons fel@@ lows on the day before out of three , checked , you might inad@@ vert@@ ently have given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips tightly sealed until the final on Thursday
all three women have settled in a ly@@ rical way why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude to why they would like to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked , &quot; If not you , who should get the last rose ? &quot; could their answers become a destro@@ yer who won the heart of the Bachel@@ ors .
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both quickly named - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and notic@@ ing ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams energies , I sen@@ sed that they were quite compatible and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah is on Earth at both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week showed her clear that wood could be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ condition@@ ally att@@ un@@ ed to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked wh@@ om@@ ever Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zzling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the b@@ achel@@ or will be broadcast on Ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ ush@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a don@@ ki as he did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ sions on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ ush@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return and also to the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ ush@@ a still showed his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
in his press conference Tom@@ sul@@ a also reinforced his press conference after the match .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his missed catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian ent@@ our@@ age had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a po@@ orer start in his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne resem@@ bled the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut then in 2007 , when a passport with his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lay the clo@@ ister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ai@@ van@@ er called for the establishment of UN shel@@ ters for refugees in Syria , just as they were during the Yugoslavia war in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free voters chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to post@@ p@@ one free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more personnel for the administrative courts responsible for asylum proceedings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum judges , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W manager critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform federal standards across Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria obli@@ ges , others not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to become more powerful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the country &apos;s policies should not fall under the table .
a long @-@ lasting tor@@ so remains on the agenda : the education policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the new school year , the Minister of Culture , Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Medium @-@ level plus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which an extension of the upper secondary school level is tested for three to four years - in the result it takes again nine years to finish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger is not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we demand freedom of choice for all gym@@ na@@ sia who want this .
free travel at G@@ 9 wherever desired .
fir@@ mer Wall Street helps Da@@ x jump on jumps
following a widespread and nervous trade course , the German stock market has closed with profits .
it was only in the afternoon that a strong pr@@ el@@ ude to the US stock exchange ensured a clear direction that ultimately promoted the Da@@ x by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points upwards .
the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized values won 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2,@@ 88 points .

the trading posts in London and Paris also earned solid profits .
in the United States , the Dow Jones Sustainability Index points to around 1 percent in the increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many stock exchanges reck@@ on that the markets will take place until after the interest rate decision in the US and also for the great decline in the fut@@ ures trading on this Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the debate about the loads from the nuclear phase has temporarily pushed the shares of RW@@ E to record low and also left deep tracks at E@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German energy companies may lack 30 billion euros of provisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered slightly , but ultimately lost 3.3 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .
Infin@@ eon shares rose by another 3.@@ 22 percent at the Da@@ x peak .
according to a merchant , a positive report from the US investor magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; had a positive impact on the weekend .
so investors seem to have too little attention to the German chip@@ maker .
in doing so , investment in promising w@@ afer @-@ technologies and focus on the automotive market should be paid off .
car values were in demand : even in August , even in the traditionally weak summer month of August , more cars were sold than in the same period of the previous year , as the industry association AC@@ EA announced at the start of the International Motor Show IA@@ A in Frankfurt .
Daimler and BMW &apos;s papers increased by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets against the proposed new constitution , said a civil servant on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ el@@ ong@@ i district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Chief District Officer , said that more than 1,000 prot@@ esters had gathered outside a police station , and some of them threw stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resor@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber floors , known to be able to kill , but which are traditionally used as less le@@ thal alternatives , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ ri@@ ans say that new provinces , formed under the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence .
there were protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th .
August was killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been centrally governed for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legis@@ lators have voted this week about certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
construction site planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Old Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4,000 square metre area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are no concrete proposals .
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den intends to market an area around 4000 square meters in direct neighbourhood to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
the plan is to use the premises for a mix of trade , commerce and housing .
waiting for suitable offers is called on the part of the city .
what investor would demand is not clear yet .
correspon@@ d@@ ingly , no contracts were concluded .
the town of Em@@ den had a part of the property located at the ring road / corner Big street , bought already a few months ago and leaving the building on it .
project H@@ ieve : details on the table
the plans for a holiday settlement on the small sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
some residents are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure activities
for months , behind closed doors , it was pla@@ gu@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now there are plans for a new holiday settlement on the Little Sea near Em@@ den on the table .
the interested party , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ der Company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented his plans for the first time on Monday evening in the City Development Committee of the Em@@ den Council .
originally , this point had stood on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , who accused the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends went on the offensive from the system building management : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said in front of the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ors now .
the project , which is worth around ten to twelve million euros , has been in discussion for months .
violent reactions among sea @-@ owners who had come to the meeting brought the pictures and new details to the desired hotel building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the Meer@@ bus@@ den@@ owner and board member of the advoc@@ acy group of the An@@ gli@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be a huge block that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears , like several other project critics , that the traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all buses will have to come so that this pays off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , what is happening on the well one hect@@ are area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still lacking , the development plans were still variable .

Google launches a dou@@ bling donation campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign to launch 11 million $ for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have over@@ run the European nations , as they flee from war @-@ torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donation call on his blog .
instead of making a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , wrote about her personal experiences when she was seven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey included many dark railway and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / will be doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many were also fle@@ eing from the war @-@ torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

for slightly overweight diabe@@ tics , weight loss surgery may be helpful .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years according to a new study .
it is still too early to tell whether lightly obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data takes a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery .
weight loss surgery or obesity , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity operations have proven to be efficient in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are path@@ ologically obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , are comparing two types of obesity - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and stomach upset - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I of those undergoing this surgery fell from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately at 29 .
among those who underwent surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was completely dissolved and at 28 % partially .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , diabetes was completely dissolved in only one percent and , in some cases , only about two percent .
in addition , the results of the control of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol were generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , and found the authors .
the researchers also monitored the patient blood level of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation , the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c dropped by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce the mortality in five years , according to the leading researcher Dr Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared the average results of the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the host rec@@ tomy group ( 7.@@ 4 versus 5.1 ) and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.2 % ) and reported a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show survival benefit after five years , there are indications from a study of heavy people in Sweden that surgery results in a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , obes@@ e people who underwent adi@@ pos@@ ity surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soothing for individuals with a BM@@ I less than 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient lies between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have to wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think once they have accumulated those genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story takes place in the H@@ uns@@ r√ºck
it is an issue that is currently attracting attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets after years the flock of her youth , and she falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recent novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel might be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ r√ºck readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europe cannot accept all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama , and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying .
the Tibetan Buddhist leader demanded an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama talked about the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , focusing on ethics .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in addressing the crisis , he stressed that it was just a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , like real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we need to think about how the killing in their countries is reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 and pointed out that the violent reaction of the United States drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
quad@@ ru@@ ple increase of intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
po@@ ison@@ ous control centres in the US report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years who swallow strong alcoholic san@@ iti@@ zing agents , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of in@@ comes of disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years , the poison control centres report , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them end up in emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children do not drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants intentionally while some do it to impress their friends or because of a sample of the social media .
videos on YouTube show how juven@@ ile disinf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
young people allegedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with soft mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very appealing to children .
hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in small children , only a few sp@@ lashes of alcohol can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison emergency centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as Hospital , the Fox 4 transmitter in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you would leave no si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , then it is a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently took four sp@@ lashes of straw@@ berry eff@@ ecting hand@@ shaking hands in the school , was brought to the treatment in an emergency .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally considered as drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency physician who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah fl@@ ushed her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of bra@@ ins , as the girl was fallen by alcohol and pushed her head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs Mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and to store hands @-@ dis@@ infection products outside the child &apos;s reach .
in addition to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing hanging disinf@@ ect@@ ants which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
health authorities suggest that the product contained meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth grade in the New York State planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by spreading anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them out of their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police viewed the sha@@ ky plan as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mess &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and showed disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time gave Aber@@ deen a tight victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ ra@@ dri@@ e , allowing the D@@ ons to create a five @-@ point gap between Celtic and Celtic .
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
there are rum@@ ours about disc@@ ord at Celtic Glasgow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths spontaneously . this insi@@ sted that he and his team mates are not under increased control as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think players look forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football is bored by Dut@@ ch@@ man - de Bo@@ er
the former ran@@ ger mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch fans lost interest in Celtic fans because there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of Celtic games any more and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here talk not only about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what interests them .
there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian chef s@@ wore to turn things back .
after the defeat against Malm@@ √∂ and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which is now promin@@ ently positioned at the top of the table with five points of lead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel it exactly this way - but we must continue .
we really need the support from Celtic , because that makes the players better .
standing together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton careful in January transfers
despite his comments just a few weeks ago , suggest@@ ing that he ha@@ sten@@ ed some January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ Boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is war@@ y of the signing of new entran@@ ts and insi@@ sts that he does not want to dis@@ rupt the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x cad@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players who come in the summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you saw with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

Hear@@ ts on S@@ FA battle set for N@@ eil@@ bad comments
the Hear@@ ts led 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and lost 3 : 2 , but the defender &apos;s Red Card was later rev@@ oked - the third red card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son stays with what he said and insi@@ sts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no question of integrity , I have not commented on performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Tan@@ na@@ dice Supervisory Board has trust in Dun@@ dee United @-@ Management

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while the United Kingdom increases overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without labour for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above that of the U@@ K@@ s by 5.5 percent , as the figures of the Bureau for National Statisti@@ cs ( ON@@ S ) showed .
in the meantime , jobs in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a number above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The government &apos;s long @-@ term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year since Scotland has taken the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken interfer@@ ed with the process
because the security guards were unable to paci@@ fy the situation , the staff called the police .
only with the use of pepper spray could the officials take the stor@@ ks into custody .

why I &apos;m witn@@ essing an exec@@ ution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
a little later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see a man being brought to death .
if it happens and I hope that it will not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ sy is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and since more applications are available as places , a more mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery will take place in order to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
those who are selected will observe it emotion@@ ally .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ sy &apos;s closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of aband@@ oning my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could have been better form@@ ulate &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go into details here again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ sy is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the deed .
but I believe that there is a strong likel@@ ihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I &apos;m sure there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters who can contact you .
what you get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death .
man after wet police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the C@@ anning River
the c@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he talked to the man of the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang up the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters away from a police officer attempting to &quot; gently persu@@ ade &quot; him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale were called on Tuesday for a break @-@ in incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ si@@ vec was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tactics - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negotiating . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
master football player Ben c@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car in the dit@@ ch to escape a alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims ste@@ wards trying to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to end the race immediately .
he targeted the ste@@ wards and the integrity division of Racing Victoria and claimed that she conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching by Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and found himself under difficult conditions than it was about the positive cobal@@ t T@@ up@@ f sample at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had held back 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ onage charges and did not want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like over@@ hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it and I sat down for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk up@@ stairs and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
when they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be more trainers .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
prior to that , M@@ oo@@ dy had made the bomb blast in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity division had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart stayed in a room with a man - whom I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing@@ .com .
they obviously believe that I am a sc@@ ammer .
if that is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses , because they failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former President of R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , reign@@ ing President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should this bring me to the conclusion that it will be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L have a cow@@ ard@@ ly attitude and maybe make people outside coaches responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now being considered .
but now I &apos;ve arrived at the point that doesn &apos;t matter to me , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainers &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have been built up with the long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ defeated Master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse @-@ strip , which pushed against the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my colleagues mistakenly placed mud on the leg .
it could have been so last night .
it could have been the whole day as it was .
but it was also the same on the day of the race .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it &apos;s a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
man after driver &apos;s cur@@ ses arrested

the cycl@@ ist was delivered to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with severe injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray @-@ Valley Highway .
the police said the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured rider .
on Monday , a 50 @-@ year @-@ old male from N@@ ath@@ alia joined the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on .
it is expected to be prosec@@ uted for driver cur@@ ses and lower assistance and other traffic off@@ ences .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy back against ri@@ vals due to claims about ring fighting
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has cri@@ tique of the Tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the ump@@ ires allowed the Storm players &quot; Ring Games &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a barely cover@@ t remark about the Storm team after his team achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended his team and said they were only concentrating on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Tac@@ kling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy also added that the critics of two leading trainers at his crew confi@@ dently agree with the fact that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s always appearing again - I haven &apos;t heard Tr@@ ent Robinson said about fights when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that throughout the year we have not changed our defensive system or techniques . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles a real focal point , and this has provided us with the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not accustomed to losing , so it was a bit shock to him .
it &apos;s funny how this occurs again and again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts &apos;s St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting it was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he will take care of a sc@@ andal .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like these .
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos vs. Cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks and no points a little exciting ?
for me it &apos;s the game boards .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase .
the Storm team has won this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday night in the pen@@ ultimate in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Serbian with $ 200,000 Guarant@@ eed on drug deposit
a man who could potentially face a life @-@ long sentence due to his attempt to get into possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a $ 200,000 deposit .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed as he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later in the Caf√© Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a potentially life sentence for an attempt to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that could have been in the caf√© out of a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the danger of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear connections to Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he declared on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars for security in order to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it declarations of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Justice Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone won &apos;t be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he aband@@ ons his Australian and Serbian pass , reports to the police daily and stops at an exit lock from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident at A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab apart
at a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 at Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved were bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment , as the police announced .
the driver &apos;s cab was completely torn apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was closed for six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
there was a loss of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es to send pictures
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of an 11 year old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the phone of the girl when she was asleep , logging into an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a number of un@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl a@@ woke later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping ho@@ gg .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ er@@ ted her mother immediately .
the police took care of this and saw the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web searches , which used terms for the search for in@@ decent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg then claimed to the officials that he did it because it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es on the internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preten@@ ding to be a polic@@ eman in order to frigh@@ ten them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be addic@@ tive to frigh@@ ten people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that the search on the computer was carried out by him , but he said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es .
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was shaking and crying .
she also saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ant with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused used computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation to speak with girls who looked much younger than he was .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the indictment , inc@@ ess@@ ant pictures of children on 14 June last year to viol@@ ate the conditions and not to appear before the court for a hearing on 24 March this year .
defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked Ho@@ gg to not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , argu@@ ing that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; could be found in his crime .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael dismissed the verdict by October to obtain background reports on social work .
Ho@@ gg was given a deposit in this case but was held in custody for hear@@ ings to other cases pending .
he was still admitted to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of judgment .
slu@@ gs switch to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up outside the main control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many floo@@ ders left the people increasingly at smaller border cross@@ ings because of fear of discovery and arrest .
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
since Tuesday , more than 1000 refugees have been taken up along the river Inn river Inn and Rot@@ ary Inn .
they were on foot over bridges and shr@@ ub@@ s to the German side .
there they are received by federal police and forwarded to the registration .
according to the German Federal Police Office , more refugees gathered at the Munich Main Railway Station in comparison to the weekly start on Wednesday .
about 700 people arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 a.m. , a spokes@@ man said in the morning .
after the re @-@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : runner @-@ up of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the Sou@@ thwest
meteor@@ ologists warn against storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low @-@ pressure area over Western Europe , hot sea air flows into the country , distributed by the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful low was the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was drawn over the Atlantic over the last few days from the Bermuda Islands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected mainly in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , the Black Forest can also be expected to count on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and the bottom @-@ se@@ abed with bends of 60 to 90 kilometres per hour .
on Friday , the sun can be seen again longer .
the crowd makes it : every two years the car engineers at the IA@@ A show their novel@@ ties .
in 2015 , it is mainly on the move to the compact cars that are currently selling very well .
at present , cars from the compact class are particularly popular : some 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the German Motor Show ( KBA ) alone in August .
this is also reflected at the IA@@ A ( public stage 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars , many new compact models will be introduced this year .
one of the greatest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available to dealers in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive either .
Opel is entering the world &apos;s largest competi@@ tor VW Golf with a view that starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra costs from 16@@ 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is powered by a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
furthermore , the H@@ esse offers further diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which for the first time include three @-@ cylinder petrol engines .
unlike the most important competitors , VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which can also be seen at the International Motor Show ( IA@@ A ) .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IA@@ A ?
Renault M√©@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ ri@@ vals M√©@@ gan@@ e to the race .
at the fair , the M√©@@ gan@@ e can only be seen as a five @-@ door in a conventional and an under@@ lined sporty GT version .
in the trade he comes early next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan off@@ shoot wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
with its curved lines , the compact Infin@@ iti is fully integrated into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer also includes a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with petrol engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) according to manufacturer &apos;s instructions .
the sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not entirely new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen at the International Motor Show ( IA@@ A ) .
on the outside the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ √´@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers mainly applied on the front part : the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ otain@@ ment system was modernis@@ ed , the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and integrated for the first time Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play .
in addition , at the IA@@ A in the compact class , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the new Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are human @-@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has given the right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the detention centre of Te@@ gel , who spent months in a small cell .
because of the violation of their human dignity , det@@ ain@@ ees are entitled to financial compensation if they are accommod@@ ated in too small cells .
this decision was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a resolution released on Wednesday .
according to the judges , the parties may even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
with this , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful : he was accommod@@ ated at the Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel Institute for Justice between June and November 2009 in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space ; the toilet was not separated spati@@ ally .
after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer , has meanwhile been on the open foot , was transferred to a larger cell .
his position of office as a result of the un@@ dig@@ ni@@ fied detention conditions against the Berlin country failed .
however , the Constitutional Court raised the verdict of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al and re@@ mitted the case to the trial again .
they see man &apos;s dignity viol@@ ated .
the Chamber of Appe@@ al now decides on the amount of compensation
even if , for legal reasons , only a few days of detention for compensation were decisive for compensation , a compensation request was given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear of protecting the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chamber Court must now clarify the amount of money compensation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of pen@@ al .
they only said in April a prisoner claim compensation because he was imprisoned in a cell naked .
according to a decision of 2011 , the multiple occup@@ ancy of a cell without a separate toilet is un@@ worthy of human dignity .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , who had agreed to a det@@ ain@@ ee in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the former pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff lived between 15 and 21 hours a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case .
over the past few weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also hit the head@@ lines due to lack of personnel .
prisoners are therefore always included again and again 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness is increasing , even in fights it should have come about because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the point of view of the Justice Press , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied for young researchers , 19 are to be om@@ itted in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
according to the German Federal Ministry of Interior , some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year , according to Deputy Secretary Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can create that and we create that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming on in Germany gives the following overview .
according to various progn@@ oses between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments each year - for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as ever ( 250@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings ) .
the lack of housing is dramatic , but above all with affordable rental properties : between 60@@ ,000 and 80@@ ,000 social housing units fall out of the lease agreement every year , and refugees are also applying for these particularly favorable housing .
for this reason , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the P@@ est@@ el Institute &apos;s perspective : 80 000 social housing needs to be produced annually , and the federal government would have to invest 6.@@ 4 billion euros per year .
scientists and Federal Minister of Agriculture agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that 55 per cent of the poultry in Germany can be employed in the long @-@ term .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation critic@@ ises .
but for the integration of refugees , it is crucial whether they find work in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the support society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of migrants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mig@@ ration@@ alist Dietrich Thr@@ √§n@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany , according to the Thr@@ √§n@@ hardt , there has been a political turn : from the prohibition of work for refugees to recognise work .
while there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as is the residence requirement , the asylum seekers are limited to a residence .
in society , too , because of the shortage of skilled labour , there has been a majority of the points of view that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly .
the lack of knowledge of German is a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market .
so far there is no available offer in general and professional language courses .
research also shows that workplaces are most frequently communicated by personal contacts .
for this reason , the construction of networks is the K√∂nigs@@ weg path to work integration .
the Berlin School Administration has found that only a few fled parents give their children to the kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; it is very important for parents to live together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ sten@@ bar , Youth and Family Spo@@ kes@@ person at the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes manuals in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators increased sharply due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for instance by allowing more technical schools .
students without knowledge of German will be prepared for lessons in the countries .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ags from the Berlin School Administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk appreci@@ ates that approximately 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no federal state banned asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception to date has been Berlin , Interior Sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his stance .
student @-@ willing refugees could be easier access to the university .
for refugees with a residence or debt do not receive any benefits according to the asylum seekers &quot; law if they start studying .
the latter generally do not receive a B@@ af@@ √∂@@ g , as they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to b@@ angers .
tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years so far to be eligible for B@@ af@@ √∂@@ g , from January 1 , 2016 , this span will be shortened to 15 months .
but this financing gap must also be closed , &quot; said Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the Deutsche Studenten@@ werk .
the students should get B@@ af@@ √∂@@ g straight away .
in the future , Islam will play a more important role , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually conc@@ ede to Islam the same rights as the churches have , and the existing state church right to develop a new state @-@ religion relationship .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic well @-@ being that professionally takes care of newcom@@ ers .
responsibilities also belong to the rights .
so the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be willing to work with the state in many areas and grant him certain control options .
this also includes the willingness to take preced@@ ence against religious fundament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , vo@@ iced concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to take such conflicts in Germany immediately &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law into Arabic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also need to change the majority society , the reduction of discrimination and racism is becoming more pressing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result of European decisions , Germany has - as a result of European decisions - an anti @-@ discrimination point and a general gender equality law since a decade .
but it is very slow , as the NS@@ U murder series revealed , in which police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motif .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants and the advoc@@ acy groups of non @-@ white German require long and why international agreements such as anti @-@ racism are committed to Germany must become a reality in the coming years , if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens should take advantage of its opportunities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the refugees that have so far been expected , according to medical president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as Man@@ - Power and capacities are concerned , we do so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery claims to susp@@ end health maps immediately upon registration .
provided services could later be accounted for by the federal states .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to iron so many people with the limited catalogue of services that the asylum seekers act law fores@@ ees .
other than that , the doctors make it possible for the doctors to create language barriers .
so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are getting worse about their diseases than other patients .
it is not only in clinics , also in medical practices , interpreting boo@@ sts need to be taken over , it calls for them .
many refugees were also helped with more general medical centres in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic look .
among refugee children , for example , there are clearly more un@@ dealt han@@ dicapped people , and the young people are about to raise awareness about HIV .
with the partially different diseases , German doctors come from their training , but Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis is not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the lack of doctors , it may even be allevi@@ ated by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans had a highly developed educational system , some refugees were even doctors .
in order to be allowed to practice , however , they must demonstrate their qualifications and possibly take examinations .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill according to estimates by the Bundes@@ psycho@@ therap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially vulnerable are refugee children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recent study by the TU Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives in trau@@ mati@@ sed Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffer from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , pal@@ pit@@ ations and death @-@ fears .
other symptoms include sleeping and concentration problems , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment is necessary , declared Mun@@ z .
to date , however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
while psych@@ ically ill asylum seekers can make an application for psycho@@ therapy in the welfare offices , the treatment usually lasts several months .
in addition , in the social @-@ offices , mostly non @-@ skilled workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses will decide whether therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .

for more than 33 years , the Circus is in the hands of the family Pro@@ bst .
so the family &apos;s gift is in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to us to take people away from their daily routine and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ises the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almond cocktail with cosm@@ opolitan flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 kilometer long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus &apos;s program convin@@ ces with talented artists from all over the world .

gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to various animal welfare organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it &apos;s not good for our animals , we don &apos;t get well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each pet@@ ting unit .

we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it does not want to enter the arena .
the upper@@ most commandment therefore : good for the animals .

Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in Parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , the el@@ dest leader of Africa , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across social media .
the opening of parliament was also clou@@ ded by statements by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe from Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen as well .
last month , they had ki@@ cked him out and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the Nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told journalists about Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the affected parliament members that the immunity of the Parliament is ending and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will split into two listed companies this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service business activities .
the expected job cuts lead to a load of over $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , &quot; stated HP in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , President and Chief Executive Officer , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on delivering unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; explains the company &apos;s statement .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to produce electro @-@ plants and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to cope with the aband@@ on@@ ment of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the belief that closely focused companies provide a better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says team @-@ mates must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario implies that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four matches for England , and in view of his history , his participation in the next summer at the European Championship is certainly uncertain .
the big shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the pres@@ e@@ ason .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone which did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger recognized , there is the associated risk of further injury , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he played in only 65 of Arsen@@ al &apos;s 15@@ 7 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for Arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last over the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a casual time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win fighting power , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves .
Arsen@@ al starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns up a rotation within the team .
H@@ √©@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ √≠n and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning that Ma@@ th@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and give the players who need it to take a short break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsen@@ al &apos;s top favor@@ ites are to go through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has been launched in the last season .
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , where the Richter scale was measured 3,@@ 2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven by the far hope to lead the association to its first European apo@@ calyp@@ se .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked at Arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ fes@@ tivity : the comedy show , which gave us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the lack of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up has become more desperate now than ever , as suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to address the issue , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a her@@ edi@@ tary life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man with the aim of asking the culture to question the men to seek help if they need them .
friendship is at the heart of the fight to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms stated that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends first , so that friendship can work .
in the age of communication led through social media , with its emphasis on substance on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even though in reality the isolation dominates .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy .
the beautiful thing about Friends was that this focus was turned up@@ side down .
each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments at football look in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can relate to it , even though they often hold back to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a telephone pastoral worker told me : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and at risk of suicide has shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness if one talks about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status about the phone will help people in moments of despair also , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Celeb@@ ration with the backdrop completely re@@ designed to celebrate the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or even better , if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello .

di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ √∂
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Rodri@@ ani after his hits against Malm@@ √∂ .
di Maria meets with his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by Malm@@ √∂ .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main launched his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ √∂ in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ Stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria arrived less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League de@@ but@@ s as a PS@@ G player who brought the French master on the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally reached their lead when Cav@@ ani achieved a header in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sha@@ k@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , as they seek not only the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced by his hom@@ etown team and against the club with whom he started his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , cause problems to our opponents and relax , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t scored one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury , which in the weekend could hold a 2 : 2 tie in his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was described as the man who took PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he interpreted why when he passed into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ i &apos;s pass behind Malm@@ √∂ defense before he passed Johan Wil@@ and into the long corner of the network .
but if anyone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a big victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ √∂ , who hit Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was armed with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field a heavy opponent .
but apart from a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos; posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave himself up , with some bad passes and bad deals , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was in no less than five attempts on his own in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after re@@ boot .
nevertheless he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c who turned Di Maria into a shooting shot by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the pole ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an achieved his sixth round of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ √∂ could come back into play , and only an excellent way to stop Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the end result could keep low before replacement players Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi had been recognized at the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the coach of Malm@@ √∂ , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , we have only played in the Swedish league which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualifying games are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola from 2008 prevented changing to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously a few years ago shortly before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times Cup winner , four times champion league winner , twice champion league champion , twice European champion , one time champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to the al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now betra@@ ys that he was standing before the European Championship prior to the Euro 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ √ßa was willing to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won everything at that time , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and also the FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ mel@@ ig@@ ge wanted me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in memory : in the summer of 2008 J√ºrgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern .
guar@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i didn &apos;t change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this is now working for the German record master : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ √ßa negotiated Guardi@@ ola and I played a great European . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that he has gotten me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavarian over the entire distance on the lawn , switched the reds out of ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated at the end the King &apos;s Triumph .
matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confronted the African film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on the variety and said she wasn &apos;t needed behind the scenes .
as a result of the Sunday night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown broke out when this emphas@@ ised the need for alternative perspectives in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the selected script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it with the occupation of the film and not in the lin@@ eup of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted shock , insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian captiv@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to ask people to think about it - anyone who will be the director - how they treat the character of the Harmon@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a nut that is beaten by her white col@@ der .
the producer of Dear White People chose Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said that her directing &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded with dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip , writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain its variety - that &apos;s SO K@@ NO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise racial representation is at the forefront of social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement exer@@ ted a nationwide impact , and urged the legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discri@@ min@@ atory practices against color content .
in February , Singer Prince made an all@@ usion to the movement during the release of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album quietly matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
like books and black life , albums have still their meaning .
in recent times , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published a statement in response to the question of the Fox News Person@@ ality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ les invited to visit the pop@@ e to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or crowns the first champion
professional cycling clim@@ ber Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete to win the American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which was just completed its 7th season , never experienced a competition participant who completed all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten to the final .
the climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope was part of the last task in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time with which he was the first athlete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge fully three seconds faster , making him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned or deserved more than 10,000 $ , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of a sudden ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , did not receive any prize money .
according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the quick@@ est time , &quot; said We@@ ed .
how much money is a wonderful prize and the life changes , he gets the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he will hate any res@@ ent@@ ment .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received crowds of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , I am glad that Isaac is &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt as if they had sw@@ apped the roles .
America N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ aks past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
earlier they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand in the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 at Target Field .
the T@@ wins made a chance to climb within a half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card Square .
for Detroit , although only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so hard to handle over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories make fun no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ extremis@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two Inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to stop this year severely , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw any game in the bull@@ pen , and so I want to go into the game very concentrated .
the designated tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ star hit by Mart@@ ine@@ z ever since he had four hits against Seattle naval on July 6th .
&quot; he excell@@ ed the schla@@ gh@@ ol@@ z , &quot; he said .
he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked much better at the bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the rear of the seventh Inn@@ ings , the T@@ wins had their best chance to get into the game again .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ hand Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy passed the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run escape from the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the finishing run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Major League &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the 27th consecutive time this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe struck a Double Play &quot; &quot; &quot;
after Detroit added an insurance @-@ run at the end of the ninth in@@ ward , Wall created a R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed man , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano on three Pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
Detroit benefited at the start of the game by an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three races in the first two pati@@ os against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been deleted from the injury list before the game had been missing for more than a month because of a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I &apos;ve been wishing for , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ ushes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z led Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; during the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 winning stre@@ ak with the runners in the sc@@ oring position .
the third bass player Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the tig@@ ers placed in the second , achieved a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE for 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he did not hit very well , but he caught the right position .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the Reli@@ able right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four strokes .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z was eliminated because of an injury to the litter &apos;s shoulders .
he is being examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the injury list due to shoulder breaks , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is kn@@ itted from the vulner@@ ability list to launch against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing on the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will finish their series of three matches at Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4,@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are to be found in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the arriving people will then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the City of Wiesbaden r@@ ushed on Tuesday evening .
she counted 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this event in recent days .
up to 1,000 refugees can temporarily sign up .
they are then to be distributed to other municipalities .
according to the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ r√§si@@ dium casting 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse , according to the data of the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ r√§si@@ dium casting for the first time alone , there were 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse .
also Frankfurt and Han@@ au have set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls due to the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria are an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe the decisive thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he accused European states of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one would have been happy that the ch@@ ali@@ ce passed by a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict is crashing in front of our front door , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase of international aid on the ground for the refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria has re @-@ established controls on its southern and eastern borders .
Austrian Federal Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening in Austrian television station ORF , but no one was sent back to Hungary .
even Germany did not send back refugees to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , that &apos;s so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement that Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there have already been discussions between the General Director of Public Safety and Repres@@ ent@@ atives of Germany .
they did not call them concrete figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , together with several other EU heads of state and government , applied for a special summit next week .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on a common action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers plan to take a new approach to the binding distribution of further 120 000 refugees at a special meeting next Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
in view of the strong refugee service in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial and distribution of people .
the Federal Government will manage this together with the countries , on the late Tuesday evening , Merkel announced after almost four hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chanc@@ ellery in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined those people who need protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if you don &apos;t have a pen@@ al perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this view was strongly divided in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck in the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometer @-@ long border with Serbia in the night on Tuesday .
a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border with Romania could be crossed with a fence .
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent tu@@ g@@ boat ev@@ asive routes from Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports in Turkey , thousands of other migrants lost their way to the Greek border .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes researchers from observations of the space probe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to this , the moon is easily stag@@ gering on its orbit around the ring @-@ planets .
this motion of motion is only small , but nevertheless too big for a permanently fixed glob@@ es body , it is stated in a communication from Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) from Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the journal &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
it was known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had already discovered iron vul@@ can@@ es at the south pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds , sp@@ itting water vap@@ our and ice particles and thus feeding the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ ring of Saturn &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed at that time .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is difficult for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we have to think about it now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sports Director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ g√º@@ n in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of an un@@ compatible professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;

no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but whoever wants to pay attention to his slender line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ goes contain relatively high sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
nevertheless , the exotic fruits are healthy : they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ur@@ sor beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits , thus support vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying man@@ goes , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ gos can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go , however , also gives sav@@ our@@ y dishes a special note .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .

the US package service U@@ PS brings up to 9@@ 5,000 temporary workers for the Christmas business in the US .
the company already started recru@@ iting seasonal workers , U@@ PS announced on Tuesday .
most of all drivers are looking for .
already last year , U@@ PS had increased its workforce by 9@@ 5,000 pa@@ yers for the holiday season .
in view of the bo@@ oming online business U@@ PS and its competi@@ tor F@@ ed@@ Ex have been making arrangements to be prepared for Christmas business since last year .
in 2013 , delayed deliveries had made harsh criticism to the package services .
first blow storm , then striking cold front
in the coming night , in the valleys of the alpine side of the fo@@ eh@@ n , the F@@ √∂hn winds through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz announced on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night for Thursday the hair dryer partly blows through the fo@@ eh@@ ne pe@@ eler .
after F@@ √∂hn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a distinctive cold front , which brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature decline .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a communication , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a strong south@@ western current .
on the side of the Alps the fo@@ eh@@ n breaks through the valleys at night to Wednesday .
as a result , the F@@ √∂hn winds up until Thursday morning in the footh@@ ills with arches of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the F@@ √∂hn can reach into the adjacent centre and on the mountains even hurri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair dryers for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees Celsius , the humidity starts to st@@ ow on the alpine slope .
here rain starts , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , in the south of the Alps , some more than 100 liters of rain per square meter must be accounted for in the next 48 hours , this after a large amount of rain has already fallen in the last few days .
on Thursday morning the blow dryer is blowing , causing a cold front with strong , partially thunder@@ ed rain from west to east via Switzerland .
together with the cold front the wind refresh@@ es strongly until stor@@ my , and the temperatures go well back .
the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , however , on the weekend it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now holds a Martin @-@ Luther place
nearly 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz in Rome .
in the presence of Mayor Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino , a previously nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now honoured as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome , next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working community of the Protestant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , rec@@ alled on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could only live their faith in the city of the Pop@@ es for centuries as a minority .
with the place I become visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith is welcomed in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered himself a young August@@ inian mon@@ k for the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 several months in Rome .
he felt the town back then as a deca@@ yed sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
his negative impressions are likely to have strengthened him in his later fight against Rome .
Luther had initiated the split of the Oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his theses on the decline of the aband@@ on@@ ment .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) crown is one of the major works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated biblical texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with splendid pictures .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary , it can be quite glo@@ omy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project for which he made a subjective and artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Book of All Books &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are cycles that focus on topics such as clo@@ ist@@ ers , pla@@ gues , commandments or fa@@ therhood .
with this he spontaneously fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther publishing house with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its emphasis on art books .
and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective biblical places on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into the present , in current context . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original biblical quotation of Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who here formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
this makes the 75 year old double a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , who was born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family belonging to the strict protest@@ ant ruler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the education happened already with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt recalls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work out to work with the Lord again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to revi@@ ve art in a fast @-@ pac@@ ed time : &quot; the perception of pic@@ torial worlds is shaped by advertising , and it is loud .
symbol@@ ism is displaced .
artists have a different desire and joy to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt would like the viewer to &quot; fall &quot; into the images , let them work , discover and sense what force they have : &quot; the image is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; always &quot; to be a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he lives with his pictures . &quot;
I did not take care not to fully grasp the Bible , but chose the most important , mysti@@ cal themes for him .
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the images , the text merely explains . &quot;
for Hans M@@ √∂h@@ ler from Luther &apos;s publishing house this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ √∂h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
part of the origin@@ als - paper and linen pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on November 15 in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
beginning of construction for BM@@ X railway draws near
plans made , place found , company commissioned , Erd@@ h√º@@ gel model@@ ed for a round course : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was finished .
failure in politics and administration ensured dr@@ unk@@ enness , especially among residents who did not want to tolerate the railway .
so hill de@@ ported , new place searched - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
the approval will be received in October , and the first joint member Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further commem@@ oration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensified engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B wi@@ dens its commitment to refugees by 2019 and the Bundes@@ liga is a clear sign on the weekend .
the football re@@ acts to the sharpen@@ ing situation in Germany and sec@@ ures policy its help in tac@@ kling the upcoming problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; nobody can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t concern me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of interest to everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B chief Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he will discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the Chanc@@ ellery next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mrs. √ñ@@ zo@@ ƒü@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and will help .
the decisive turn@@ outs , however , must set the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation has ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; explained Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the ver@@ ge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some federal li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already this weekend , the 36 professional associations put a clear sign when they will be wearing the print &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the left jer@@ sey instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sports director Ru@@ di V√∂l@@ ler from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matter of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drama of refugees goes to everyone , nobody can see it away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use football clubs , no , we have to use our bla@@ sting force , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent character of the league . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the national team of women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Quali@@ fication Game against Hungary this Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a big collective work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 lic@@ en@@ see associations had started their own projects in their loc@@ alities was great .
just as great is that small and small clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and the next year , the association , together with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government , provides 300@@ ,000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already rec@@ alled the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP executive officer loses an eye in case of accident
according to several reports , the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software corporation , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye through a crash in early July .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the accident on the staircase in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he fell to a glass of water after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he almost ble@@ eds , was power@@ less , then dra@@ gged out into the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP Co @-@ Fo@@ under Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can do his job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S√ºd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full of my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , said the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can do something like this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up again when you have fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out of battle ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ ched a corresponding photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
he is therefore just as little as a reserve driver for the two stam@@ pe@@ ers Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button in Singapore on the weekend , as one week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
football : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus vs. Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : wick@@ er f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback by Marco R@@ eus have defini@@ tively sm@@ ashed in the first group game of the Europa League .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in Du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.@@ 00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot rely on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether R@@ eus will be back in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ Game against Le@@ verk@@ usen on Sunday , the B@@ V@@ B Coach admitted : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training session on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high load on its pros , Tu@@ chel will not only change its root elf on the R@@ eus position .
he announced a change to the goal keeper &apos;s position .
for this reason , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes up the place of Chief Musi@@ cians Roman brushes .
&quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the world champion .
although Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller will be used in all European league games in the future , he left the door open .
with high probability , he will also contest the second game .
the for@@ ging statement by Mit@@ ch@@ ord R@@ eus that the final move for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , says mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl : &quot; that &apos;s why Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants to lead Germany
according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany will be a technological leader in the change of the car .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on a strategy paper from the house of Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the fair IA@@ A of a &quot; new mobility era . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries that come together with industry representatives at the International Motor Show ( IA@@ A ) .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid rise in digital radio communications .
a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria is currently being tested for testing new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not impose additional liability risks &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use internationally to ensure that the maximum speed allowed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
the Federal Government also wants to advocate a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only envis@@ aged man as a driver .
in automated driving , the car is increasingly taking the lead , the driver gets more and more to the passenger .
the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economics , highly automated driving on high@@ ways will be technically possible by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should not be expected until 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany is estimated by the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD Vice @-@ President S@@ √∂ren Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability for accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the Germans are still looking skep@@ tical - much more than Fren@@ ch@@ men or Americans .
a survey by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday issued on the AA on behalf of the investig@@ for@@ gan@@ ization Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect that 31 percent believe in it at all .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents account for up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , in the United States 33 percent .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the Digital Union Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads .
at least 15 percent could be seen on the motorway , in the traffic jams 45 percent .
well , every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .
Bol@@ l says team and double start at table tennis EM
according to current status , the D√ºsseldorf @-@ based company wants to beat only in singles with the title fight between September 25 and October 4 .
the final decision should be made at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys heard it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to win the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said German coach J√∂rg Ro@@ √ü@@ kopf during the European Championship in D√ºsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bol@@ l was at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term scheduled sponsor@@ ship meeting in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo is the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Single @-@ European Champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ kl@@ ist in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also rec@@ alled the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo had been missing , and we became European leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is where we should ori@@ ent ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the fifth rank of the world ranking . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they are wearing the spectacular creations of the French designer who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men into coats .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t say today that I am the En@@ f@@ ant terrible of Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was ble@@ ak in the past , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is visible from the 18th of September at the Kunsth@@ alle des Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer changed his first negative attitude to a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For me , an exhibition sounded a bit of death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously taken place in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into this hardly visible work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show isn &apos;t built up , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed complete artwork for which much effort has been practi@@ sed : to fr@@ at@@ ze the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was specifically hired .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have made 14 tons of material to Munich .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special treat : a leder@@ h@@ osen outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gau@@ l@@ tier &apos;s old ted@@ dy bear can also be seen in the exhibition .
it stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashion attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he wasn &apos;t a good student and bad in football ) he dressed his ted@@ dy bear and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
his parents wouldn &apos;t have allowed him to play with a doll .
he then taught himself to disc@@ ard fashion himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
for his first fashion show he did not have to pay the models .
they got nothing , but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of sheer curtain - P@@ lau@@ en tip as fashion ni@@ ches
earlier we went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in large quantities for customers who , for example , continued to work on ceilings and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ thers P@@ lau@@ en .
instead fashion is important again .
in the early days of the P@@ lau@@ en tip , fashion played a major role , then was ou@@ sted by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , for accessories such as bags and for regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans against past styles , is an increasing order potential .
those who do not use any ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already make half of all orders .
Mo@@ thers P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery , together with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
in the last 15 years , about 80 percent of sales have been broken away .
there is almost no more private specialty shops and wholes@@ al@@ ers .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
the mass goods are produced much cheaper nowadays in the Asian region and almost exclusively sold via chains .
exports are also weak@@ ening , up @-@ to @-@ date to Russia and the US .
there are enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association is also trying to focus on environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains about the embroi@@ dery in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year , we have been running a seal of quality that shows that we produce environmentally and socially sustainable products . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schne@@ e@@ berger branch of the University of Applied Sciences in Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - special@@ ising in embroi@@ dery and lace .
in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , one has to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies that need to think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historic snow@@ ball point .
in doing so , the machine bu@@ cks small spheres in some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gold@@ smith master@@ in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ √üe took inspiration : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , I could not start anything with traditional P@@ lau@@ dry lace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of pure lace - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland , especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and want to have a mem@@ or@@ and@@ um .
with this I see my jewellery as modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ en tip .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
legends are not to be touched , but Disney still dar@@ es to take a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it &apos;s not about re @-@ movie but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes 20 years after the first movie with the magical child ma@@ ids .
it &apos;s about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks Family in times of the Great Depression in England .
those who play P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
but the director is already clear : Ro@@ b Marshall , last with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema .
XI ur@@ ges the economy to open wider to the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy needs to open wider to the outside in order to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping stated on Tuesday of a group charged with steering the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should invest in attracting foreign investment and know @-@ how and improving strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Leadership Group for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
advancing new start @-@ ups and driving forward reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new place for economic growth , Xi declared .
the management group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list for regulating the access to the market , relaxing the border control policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system .
after the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment .
the system is tested gradually and improved by testing programs .
the initiative is of great importance since it plays a major role in the allocation of resources to the market , guarantees a right @-@ wing business environment and stream@@ lines the market , said the statement .
the government will also lo@@ osen up controls over the powers transferred to the company and make sure companies decide how to manage their businesses .
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas will be opened for private investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policies towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to guarantee the right of lawyers to exercise their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated in the meeting as reported in a declaration published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit value in predat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and consumers thus expect a much higher dose of the neur@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Consumer Organization F@@ ood@@ watch , who has received an appropriate working paper from the EU , sharply critici@@ zed the plans : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant women and infants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as sh@@ arks and s@@ word@@ fish , are to be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
large predat@@ ory fish are already so heavily loaded with mercury today that , on the basis of the still valid limit values , about 50 per cent of catches are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be uns@@ al@@ able .
in return for this loos@@ ening , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to ag@@ grav@@ ate the limit values of other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because smaller ch@@ equ@@ es , such as car@@ p , are usually so low that they already comply with the planned maximum values . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dy distra@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolfgang sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal which is highly toxic to humans , which is particularly rich in predat@@ ory fish over the food chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government therefore warns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small amounts of particularly un@@ born damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its website with regard to the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is primarily due to coal burning into the environment .
according to a written information from the German Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power stations reach more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount em@@ itted in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish , for instance in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube , was &quot; permanently and nationwide , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had cited in March from the paper .
last year Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish have already been among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
