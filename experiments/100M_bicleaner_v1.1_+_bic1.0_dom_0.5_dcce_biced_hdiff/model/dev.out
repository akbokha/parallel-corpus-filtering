Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu isn &apos;t just a friendly one .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
at the meeting , however , it should also concern the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington is critici@@ zing Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and repro@@ aching Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal between the two has deterior@@ ated further by the deal struck by Obama for the Iranian nuclear program .
in March Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the Repub@@ lic@@ ans before the U.S. Congress , which was partly considered an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with an indication of the upcoming election in Israel .
in an emergency call , a professor conf@@ esses to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb spoke with a somewhat mur@@ ky voice to the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was important to stress that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably excited and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the house the officials found the cor@@ pse of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note scri@@ b@@ bling on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted I could reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
there was no indication that Lamb , who had taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school premises , where according to the police , he shot and killed a popular professor of history , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University police chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb did the fat@@ eful distress at some point after that .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after the shooting in the university , forcing students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal pre@@ history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a book written by him , Schmidt himself mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty contains 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time there were some inclin@@ ations to problematic behavior .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and told him that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
the latest changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the doc@@ torate , which Lamb had worked so hard for him , would not represent a guarantee for an automatic path to employment as assistant professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the escape from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs Spur later , when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb opened himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb began his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with approximately 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and pedago@@ gy .
he did his doc@@ torate in the spring of education .
one of the long @-@ time friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met by common friends .
she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar playing .
he was at that time the flock of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls were melting away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , Lamb said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but had been friends and had a daughter who was 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail occurred three years ago both on a summer @-@ fair market .
later they played together the one or other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night of 5th September for the last time after Lamb completed his guitar and oral harmony playing before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that anything was wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were sitting up and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American native and colonial history , &quot; Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his bro@@ therhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght memorial service .
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt took part in the M@@ ahn@@ guard , while the Univers@@ it√§@@ tsch@@ or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb opened the emergency after he had shot Schmidt , and that lamb in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss , while his wife described , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
To@@ ys R Us plan to employ fewer workers for the Christmas season
To@@ ys R Us says that it won &apos;t be as many Christmas seasonal workers as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said it would plan to hire 40,000 people in shops and distribution centers throughout the country . 4@@ 5.000 workers were hired during the Christmas season 2014 .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees will rise from October to December .
while the holidays are still months away , the Christmas business is drawing closer , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equi@@ p shops with employees who sell , ship and deliver products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael J. Fox is jo@@ king over his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; date &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Princess Diana &quot; &quot; &quot;
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film starts , and it comes to mind that I am a simulated cast and a length of arms about being with the princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s really for me , &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; un@@ disputed the biggest time travel film ever filmed . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN chief said there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says that his response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will only exac@@ erb@@ ate violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN chief reiter@@ ates all the parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and to support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution .
Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - U.S. , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the si@@ delines of the meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he depl@@ ored that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in addressing the crisis in Syria , which they have proven in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 Survey results show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks at poll@@ s , it has not worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of whom only won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now detect tr@@ umps per@@ sever@@ ance and begin to let their dollar flow to overthrow it .
here are some current survey figures indicating that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
the popularity of tr@@ umps has turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two out of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l in a positive way .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
now six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ vot@@ er GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two out of 10 say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they are &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about junk ) .
the next in terms of excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; if Y@@ eb Bush , the establishment &apos;s favorite , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans do not see l@@ umps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of Irish voters tend to believe that real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , the ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is seen in the nation &apos;s first election state , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively perform his ministry , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temp@@ er did not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
repub@@ li@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they set up their hats , Republi@@ can voters keep up Tr@@ ump for real .
if they are asked who most likely wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a survey by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten will say that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four out of ten at the end of July put their money at J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P @-@ voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination vis @-@ √† @-@ vis only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , there is evidence that a variety of GO@@ P @-@ vot@@ er campaign s@@ ling@@ ing campaign can be viewed as plau@@ sible .
even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump still strikes each other .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to s@@ ling@@ ing , while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is diff@@ used to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey by Mon@@ mouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump re@@ aps the majority support .
he has 13 points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally on edge Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their opinion .
a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday reveals that only slightly more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump are saying that they have given their votes firmly .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one really can say never change opinion .
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nevertheless , the strongest competition is the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for pumping .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with the issue of immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two months ago , immigration has been a turning point in public discourse in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some are worried that the bom@@ b@@ astic way of pumping out the decisive His@@ pan@@ o Americans will be kept away from the Republi@@ can party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but after the new ABC / Post Survey of Monday six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with the issue of immigration .
so long as immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ ight , Donald Tr@@ ump will appear to do so .
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs to new levels .
in the meantime , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son account for about half the support of Republi@@ can voters , mainly due to their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days Survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are also mad at Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Repub@@ lic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish angry . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential districts of Germany
here in the Hob@@ be@@ ken@@ weg there is the most expensive residence - with a view over the North Sea .
in the street , a square meter of a can@@ opy station costs an average of 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which particular locations one square meter is the most cost .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential locations , however , the price is just like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; V√∂lk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euros not - per square meter , well @-@ marked .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here as an exception .
champi@@ ons League : Bayern @-@ dream start thanks to M√ºller and G√∂t@@ ze
double sc@@ orer in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bavarian star Thomas M√ºller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas M√ºller paved the way to FC Bayern 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
world champi@@ ons Thomas M√ºller and Mario G√∂t@@ ze gave the FC Bayern a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; in the witch @-@ chair of Pi@@ ra@@ eus .
the team of Train@@ ers P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to M√ºll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ at@@ ous hits ( 89 . ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth star success in series is supposed to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
M√ºller received a gra@@ ceful co @-@ operation of Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto in the Champions League for the Bavarian leadership in the Champions League for the Bavarian leadership , who caused a f@@ lange of the World Champion to pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp Lah@@ ti promised before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 3@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 88 fans - and the Munich kept word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed idea without gl@@ itter@@ ing .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his latest six home games in the top class , including famous clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ √©@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 he stum@@ bled across Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they ran cour@@ age@@ ously , but with their aggressive efforts they often went too in@@ sol@@ utely to work .
the attacks were often introduced by wag@@ ering on the left @-@ wing Douglas Costa , which was seldom passed through against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
M√ºller had more luck from the right , when his flan@@ k hit the right half @-@ field in the left upper corner of the tor@@ to@@ ir .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first of all , as Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ stri@@ ker , Ide@@ ye Brown struck Poland &apos;s head @-@ ball from the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct securing the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians had their usual dominant play , Pi@@ ra@@ eus was able to set con@@ i@@ fer bites .
but on the door@@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er there was a discount .
so , for example , when he drew a shot from the idea of the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
in front of him Guardi@@ ola defended a four chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well .
Mario G√∂t@@ ze , back to muscular problems in the Ka@@ der , was sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero gave the green light only after the final training , said sports director Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to do something different , this is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the slaughter of Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
G√∂t@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it all clear 13 minutes later , mil@@ ler stepped on it by el@@ f@@ meter .
in front of the game , it had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly war@@ med up Bayern fans had prov@@ oked the fans of host Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and went with sticks against the Munich fans .
at least one Bayern fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - that suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
good news : the risk of aband@@ on@@ ment disappears quickly .
smokers have a much higher risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study by an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smoking smokers , smokers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ times higher .
the scientists had observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
the main causes of tooth loss are c@@ aries and inflammation of the gum , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphasizes the authors .
the connection between smoking and tooth loss therefore goes back to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk however within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take over ten years before the haz@@ ards fall back to the level of non @-@ smoking people , said Er@@ du@@ Gate Thomas Dietrich from Birmingham University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people need to persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smokers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said head of study H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels and results in good dental health right up to the old age .
in Germany more than 20 per cent of the population at the age of 65 to 74 years of tooth@@ lessness has been affected , the DI@@ f@@ E divided .
previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ scores the findings .
archae@@ ologists encounter birds from the late Anti@@ quity at the Rhein@@ u@@ fer
archaeological findings have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the second time .
close to the construction site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum have dug skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , Museum Director Marcus Trier , on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians are looking for so @-@ called ground monuments .
in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always attracted to the Department of Archae@@ ological Natural Monum@@ ents .
in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists were now five .
from text documents it was already known that in the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , Trier explained .
beside the remains of the fortress and the tower , a cemetery with around 350 tom@@ bs was discovered , which was probably part of the church .

EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute over the TTIP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system to clear the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TTIP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controversial private arbit@@ ration devices for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its function corresponds to much more traditional courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens can trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ str√∂m in the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swe@@ de proposed introducing the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
by means of TTIP , the largest free trade zone in the world will be created with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings fores@@ ee that the EU states and the US jointly choose independent judges for a new Investment Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries .
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to appeal against jud@@ gements .
so far , the parties involved agreed among themselves to arbit@@ ers , there was no objection to their judgment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussions over the past few months it has become clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system did not trust in fair@@ ness and justice , Malm@@ str√∂m commented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it wants to work towards an International Investment Court according to its own specifications .
there , for instance , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als ( IS@@ DS ) demanded primarily by major corporations are regarded as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel judi@@ ci@@ ary , where companies can collect damages from tax@@ pa@@ yers , negotiate national laws or enforce a lowering of consumer and environmental standards .
in initial statements , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act described the European Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate .
it has been critic@@ ised above all for failing to apply for the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German state secretary of state Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as great progress .
the Commission took into consideration essential points in the reform that Federal Minister for Economic Affairs called Sig@@ mar Gabriel in spring with other EU Trade Ministers .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ str√∂m .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the economic opportunities of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized businesses could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
when the talks on the TTIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday .
negotiations have been ongoing since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is no longer valid .
delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sat on the stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the timi@@ dly acting folk singer recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost seized by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s talk .
he tells the story of different places he repeatedly records on the map , about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they were created and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderful creative Ir@@ rer .
with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State , &quot; clever composed songs seem to be harmonious very close to American folk in the late six@@ ties , but can be dri@@ fted into the great opul@@ ent at any time .
it is rum@@ oured that &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 States states should be rec@@ alled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and in the proximity of the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and has a positive effect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
guitar and ban@@ jo are enough for him .
a year later , the musician living in New York returns to the show .
with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) , a celebrated masterpiece is published in 2005 .
exu@@ ber@@ ant of ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and missed no annual list of influential music media .
after very productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) to perform very extensive electronic components .
this sixth record studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effects and rever@@ ber@@ ations .
since long since the smaller clubs have desc@@ ended , the stage shows are a colorful spectacle from ne@@ on @-@ head@@ bands and big fluorescent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five member band .
in the dark @-@ kept ham@@ burger More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although here nearly 2,000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the distinc@@ tly mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and folk .
without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
you hear from the audience : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and you can basically throw away the &quot; record . &quot;
only to an en@@ core , St@@ ev@@ ens expresses his thanks , plays acousti@@ cally few older songs and eventually bows to thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the prime minister &apos;s fra@@ ming
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the prime minister &apos;s fra@@ ming of suspen@@ se has been eag@@ erly awaited since his election .
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will be making his debut at the prime minister &apos;s fra@@ ming and first meeting with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to face the first of his six given questions shortly after lunch , and his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs from the neighbourhood .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary scrut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns leadership because after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Conference on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour leader , on Tuesday during the singing of the national an@@ them at a commem@@ oration ceremony marking the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , has prov@@ oked criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and stands at the center of several front @-@ pages stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a Mr Cor@@ by@@ n spokes@@ man said he was &quot; in respect@@ ful silence &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told in the BBC Two News@@ night Program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; irrespective of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are calling for differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary party originally supported it as leaders .
the Political correspon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t states that political differences are also stack@@ ed within the Labour , &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation on profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference that Labour should make changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation in total .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ worker and reti@@ ring minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to lower the ¬£ 23@@ ,000 limit to ¬£ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , since he is T@@ ory boss , over the last decade across the Dis@@ patch Box in Parliament .
the Labour leader , who has promised a different set of policies , says that he has &quot; crowd sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and given him more than 30.000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s questions are too confron@@ t@@ ative to the prime minister , and that he is subjected to both &quot; impact &quot; and stri@@ fe with re@@ perc@@ ussions and has instead decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the Shadow of Economic Council , will represent him if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally seize the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy show , &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s fra@@ ming .
as it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the question was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the ruling part of a leader and his leadership in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics argued that it had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needed far @-@ reaching reforms .

pounds rise due to accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound rose mark@@ edly according to data showing an increase in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the bid objective of SA@@ B@@ Miller .
between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the quick@@ est and most profitable assessment since 2009 .
the pound increased by more than 1 % over the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to ‚Ç¨ 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after tak@@ eover bid of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v was received .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and combine brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
berry stocks were 0.@@ 9 % higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
Gl@@ en@@ core &apos;s shares rose 5 % after the mining giant said he had taken $ 2.5 billion by a stock sale as part of his strategy of debt reduction .
the shares of Mon@@ di &apos;s packaging and paper corporation were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a decrease of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had put his assessment on &quot; selling . &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % after the sports@@ wear company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the head of J@@ D Sports says higher wages je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power would offset the higher labour costs in his company , he says .
the cost could make the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and this could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

rather even more .
currently , Mon@@ si@@ eur Bi@@ eber is in Berlin .
and the generation U@@ 17 turns through .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans attended Jus@@ tin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
but since 7 am the pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates in front of Berlin &apos;s luxury hotel on Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ eber &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building : here you live I@@ dol , whose poster belongs to St@@ et@@ tin since Monday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Suite , where Canadian singer lives , costs exactly as much as her mother E@@ wa deserves in half a year .
if ever .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually my Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a would have to sit in the tenth grade in the gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am fulfilling her a dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
compulsory education ?
who cares ?
the fans don &apos;t .
also Bi@@ eber itself is not .
this has already taken care of .
for the advertisement in the advertising break of the supermarket he cas@@ c@@ aded three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ imp@@ le company r@@ ins@@ ed many , many dollars on the Bi@@ eber account .
and with every doll which looks like him and goes over the counter , Bi@@ eber also collects .
when Jus@@ tin Bi@@ eber drinks a coffee , one mar@@ vels at the wind@@ screen .
he is said to have captured more than 100 millions .
some say the hyp@@ e goes too far .
others stress that Bi@@ eber is finally in the US and Great Britain with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; in 1st place .
Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , is not interested in the many zer@@ os first .
at least he does so .
PE@@ GI@@ DA poster brings Lebanese to the idea of potato
potatoes or D@@ √∂n@@ er ?
both - and indeed in the potato d@@ √∂n@@ er , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger Imb@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the slogan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ √∂n@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat together put on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ √∂n@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he saw random@@ ly on TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , there is a barbecue in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; that &apos;s mul@@ ticul@@ tural for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the idea was to have the Lebanese registered at the Patent Office in Munich .
according to the Authority , it has recently been protected as a utility patent .
for this reason , Al@@ hay does not want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes of the sk@@ ewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding also comes well with its customers .
met@@ a Beg@@ ins Con@@ tac@@ ting campaign to fight against Al@@ di@@ - In@@ ci@@ dent
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the I@@ GA branches from an Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a ground tracking campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di is preparing the opening of two distribution centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia in the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand I@@ GA through mainstream marketing and marketing about the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
I@@ GA dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA shops and store owners who sell approved tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish more details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler of food , alcohol and equipment passes through its annual investors strategy day .
there is a lot on the game as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ a &apos;s I@@ GA shops and generate higher profit margins as Met@@ a &apos;s I@@ GA network in eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern Australia .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will grab some five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after the opening of his first markets and remove all available actors , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA @-@ retailer could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and Met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this pro@@ g@@ nosis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di has opened 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and the amounts on Met@@ a &apos;s high fixed cost base could cost some $ 13 million profit before interest and tax , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , Met@@ cash will lose market shares in the eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ a &apos;s turnover in food and food business will fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told in a business lunch in Melbourne that met@@ a would likely disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the Management Board of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ AS market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenues from Met@@ a &apos;s food and food trade , which has supplied around 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the reduction in operating debt at the same time on sales and margins .
the wholes@@ aler , however , resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to boost sales prices with Col@@ ors and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products each week and to improve their stores with faster growing fresh foods and deliver a better selection of home @-@ label gro@@ c@@ eries .
met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Chief Executive Officer Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging re@@ conditioning programs are to be made to El@@ an and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by President of Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Cy@@ ril and , according to the president of the Australian tennis association , Steve He@@ aly , deserved praise as criticism for his own behaviour .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight with the not@@ orious debate about Kyr@@ gy@@ z with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
soon afterwards , in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the arbitr@@ ator , and Har@@ rison said , &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to take a seat , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how to beat a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cra@@ mp sh@@ ook a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the sole behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m pretty busy about is the fact that after my view , Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him and I think he was treated a bit too stern .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with other players , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not consider Kyr@@ gy@@ z in the important preliminary decision , which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term fixed part of the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Nick has quickly made the ascent to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the spotlight , in which he can only think about , I consider appropriate and it is best for the team and it is the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary states emergency , closes the border , stops refugees
Hungary declared the emergency state and negotiated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to get illegal into the country . all with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border when hundreds of migrants stayed in a land of No Man and Ser@@ b officials re@@ acted with indignation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built up tents and settled down there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter was floating above them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and scre@@ amed insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some returned from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back while more and more from Macedonia and Greece were arriving . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ nation block at a disputed meeting in Brussels did not agree on a common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states would receive further 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary did not put its hopes on a spe@@ edy action from Brussels or its neighbours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the emergency level issued on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block streets and speed asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were used during the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and has become an entry point to the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most upcoming economic refugees who are in search of a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - have a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make crossing the border or damaging the 4 meter ( 13 foot ) high fence that the government had built along the southern border to Serbia led to a crime . these laws also impose higher prison sentences for convic@@ ted human traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the use of the military , which is expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen a number of heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ ony , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people tried to cross the border , 15 others were already deep into the country .
they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of off@@ loading crimes according to the new laws .
authorities are in the process of re@@ pairing the fence .
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wag@@ gon arrived with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to process people &apos;s data and squee@@ ze a crowd to push themselves there .
about 20 managed to arrive , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l
former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton keeps a double @-@ digit advance in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face to the ground .
Clinton has now supported 47 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent before ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidates for the Pres@@ i@@ dency , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the start of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion determines which candidates they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their election than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders scored some gains .
Clinton holds a great lead in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished .
their support in the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders , here , is only 5 points back .
Clin@@ tons &apos;s advantage in democratic constitu@@ ents under the age of 50 has evapor@@ ated , and they and s@@ anders are now at the same level .
Clinton , however , has a big advantage with the older voters .
last month , Clinton had a double @-@ digit margin in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has a 5 point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries state that they would support Clinton while being nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps it &apos;s not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially excited by her .
the views are stronger mixed with those who don &apos;t currently support Clinton - just about a quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their peak candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ tons supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that they have the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman president becomes ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clin@@ tons &apos;s supporters have also mentioned their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with the problems and the eligi@@ bility are also cited .
as the Vice President creates a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the pre @-@ elections want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are asked who is their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the helm .
von Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to run for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead is up against S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure has dropped by 78 percent last month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bi@@ des are by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that looks at him as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has increased .
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call for questions about eligi@@ bility .
similar to last month , not a single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these elec@@ tors of the pre @-@ elections would be unacceptable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results on some important characteristics among voters of the prim@@ aries of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den is best cut in hon@@ esty in the three candidates , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no idea of it .
democratic voters of the prim@@ aries generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic constitu@@ ents have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as Foreign Minister are still asked , most Democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions were not affected altogether .
but it &apos;s another story in the American public overall .
now half of the Americans are unhappy with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said the e @-@ mail controversy had no effect on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion had worsen@@ ed .
it is mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse .
while Clinton is regarded as honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of eligible voters do not regard it as an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of the eligible voters are also seeing Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
however , Clinton and Tr@@ ump are given good grades at guiding .
out of the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders as honestly , but as with Car@@ son many have no idea of him .
the failure rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the prim@@ aries is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son approaches Donald Tr@@ ump in nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is close behind Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times survey
in the meantime , half of the voters &apos; support in the new pol@@ l is no longer necessary for the two candidates , and others are losing a dramatic footh@@ old .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers across the country . the support grows from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son fell from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and has out@@ stri@@ pped Tr@@ ump under repub@@ li@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated with Wis@@ con@@ sin &apos;s Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell the deepest , with 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
the former governor of Florida , J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place .
the margin of error in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey published last week shows that Car@@ son is growing in the poll@@ s - with 19 % support among the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey by ABC News / Washington Post also clearly showed Tr@@ ump in front of Car@@ son .
looking at a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump took a few side @-@ si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon himself , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question the umps of faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign performance in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently warm to 29 degrees .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers already have a trip to the Mediterranean to find even warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people don &apos;t go to the sea anymore : the water has a maximum of 18 degrees in the North Sea and Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) .
on the other hand , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic , it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt reaches 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College new no@@ vice
almost two years after a student died during a deportation ritual in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , mur@@ ders were filed against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g brut@@ ally during an introduction ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , told the police .
officials said he was charged with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound ru@@ cksack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while he tried to go over a frozen field to a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about headaches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i Delta P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g fain@@ ted and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice , said Police Chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide U@@ ten@@ sils and basically set the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood through Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ emble@@ y Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added with bl@@ unt force injuries to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; too many families have been destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ anes of the Brotherhood . at least one student died in the ch@@ ic@@ anes every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation .
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment because of murder of the third degree for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of har@@ ass@@ uring attacks and the formation of a criminal organisation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that has - officially or in@@ officially - sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold them accoun@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College has forbidden the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local community .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rise in interest is coming , and the household is going bank@@ rupt , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into a recession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy provides little guidance to the process .
a recession came in only 11 months after the first rate of interest rate and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial systems react .
so representatives of the US Central Bank have so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather to the period required for normal@@ isation .
indeed , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could find that all the excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated because of a rise in interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Julian Je@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal tre@@ ble but still to a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no re@@ perc@@ ussions .
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rate increases can make things volatile for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency for assets to be ero@@ ded 12 to 24 months after the first raise , which may again reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happened after the F@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest rate increases &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , the market in the past 35 years is mostly down@@ wards - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate increase , rather flat in the 250 days afterwards ( average gain of 2.6 percent ) , then return to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , according to a recent analysis , published by Bob D@@ oll , chief asset strate@@ gi@@ sts at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares ten@@ denti@@ ally appears later in the increase cycle and the return begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rates promote it often .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that did not exist before and could speed up a recession .
it is extremely not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 only twice nominal GDP under 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest rates in such a fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whe@@ ther this time is different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the year round , the F@@ ed Group &apos;s interest rate rose all year round , and all eyes were on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading only has a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all increase cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sional heights were put into shadow very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months .
fixed income was also volatile , as the market anticip@@ ates a rise in interest rates and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in shares if they change their strategic direction .
in bonds the yields seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / reduction in the cycle takes place .
at the end of the increase cycle , the bond yields immediately fall , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will result in yields coming closer together between longer and shorter bonds and leading to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high interest rates often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
it is interesting that Jones is convinced that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is flat , lending margins have wi@@ dened and volati@@ lity has increased - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tened its strategy .
in large and large , companies that handle the greater part of their business activities in the US will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational corporations with high debts will get worse as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after initial interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed on average 5 percentage points after each of the rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a big problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
outside the pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers could see profits through higher yields , even if experts from different opinions are how fast it will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says parliamentary member Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the station for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ishable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins gra@@ bbed the voice of The Voice and said this was not very original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; converts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading Member of Parliament and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D MEP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name .
so , if you are trying to do something different - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC General Director rejected the alle@@ gations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far from its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and education of the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn anything else about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music , which is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and order new works , I really think it is important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued harder to engage the audience than it did in the past , because the British are less informed about classical music .
however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sport was under fire to tread the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins gra@@ bbed The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , bought by Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of ¬£ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Ju@@ dge - was produced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in special BBC mode &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he would like the company to find a hit from our in @-@ house barn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the next time it starts a series of entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from further rows of The Voice in the future , or to spend money on the fees for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales rose on slow@@ est in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday has slow@@ ed down the issues in November
for over a decade , virtual shopping has bo@@ oted , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
but experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers only showed 7 percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , this has always developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian .
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases using their mobile phone purchases .
it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this comm@@ its back and we may experience that growth will dimin@@ ish .
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decline in revenues .
experts believe that buyers will hold back their purchases in front of this event , which takes place last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites fell off .
experts believe that Black Friday , on which the buyers fight for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that out of ¬£ 5 was spent a little over ¬£ 1 online .
for some products such as TV and washing machines , more than a third of the gro@@ c@@ eries are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident Get@@ ting - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first funeral par@@ ishes in Mec@@ ca by the streets .
Saudi Arabia lays down the collapse of some of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group &apos;s huge Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed .
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed when a crane collap@@ sed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mo@@ sch@@ ee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mour@@ ning filled , dressed largely in white , the way to pay their respect when the first of the dead came to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the procession passed on to the Holy site , where only days before a building crane had fallen through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the worshi@@ ppers .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king passed a san@@ ction on the family bin Laden &apos;s construction company because of the disaster that also left 3@@ 94 wounded .
the bodies of 29 beds killed when a crane collap@@ sed through the Great Central mo@@ sch@@ ee Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram came from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage to support the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officers have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue after Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
king Sal@@ man said today that the Bin Laden Group should not have stopped the arm of the crane than it was not used .
an Arab version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was in charge of the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad was prohibited .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which pl@@ ung@@ ed into an inner courtyard of the Grand mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ an who later took place this month .
the Bin Laden Group has issued no statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a comment .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also rebu@@ ked the group because of not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes are surrounded by Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project managed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been connected to the royal family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over larger construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990s .
the crash of the crane arrived amid strong winds and rain , just a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said that 15@@ 8 people remain hospit@@ alized .
government officials stated that 1 million Ri@@ al ( ¬£ 17@@ 4,000 ) must be paid to the members of the killed and the same amount is permanently injured .
other injured receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap East European craftsmen is over
British employ more and more arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has seen an increase
this leads to the opening of 200 new Scre@@ w@@ fix shops targeting professional tra@@ des@@ people
at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher will close 60 B &amp; Q sales outlets nationwide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chief Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that Br@@ its will lay down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of skilled eastern European craftsmen who carry out the work in their home .
if you can deal with a hammer or a brush for painting walls , you seem to belong to a minority nowadays .
the British employ more and more craftsmen to perform do @-@ it @-@ your@@ sel@@ fers jobs in their homes , such as the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q .
V√©@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , the new Managing Director of King@@ f@@ isher , who has the Bau@@ markt @-@ Chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices is now obsol@@ ete .
for this reason , King@@ f@@ isher is planning to open 200 new Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that are aimed at professional tra@@ des@@ people and to close 60 outlets of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are met by women .
at the moment the men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to address the growing demographic trends that have more female single households which perform more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to move this stronger towards equilibrium . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions about buying articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British UK &apos;s FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that has owned 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial board .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales , after the group bl@@ amed the cost of closing the stores .
because of the trend , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob on account of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball vice master A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and ev@@ asion .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of office .
he was legally acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial was postpon@@ ed .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney @-@ At@@ tor@@ ney @-@ General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the preliminary investigation revealed that the defend@@ ants were used for private purposes during the years 2006 @-@ 2011 mon@@ ies of association accounts , through which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions .
the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros .
sports officials are also accused of financial off@@ ences .
this fact was the chair of the Sho@@ v@@ eller Senate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
for the sake of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that at no time an asset had ar@@ isen from the association .
sports officials had only charged expenses and the sports club for which they had been operating from 1982 to 2011 and in which they invested a lot of time and money from debt - the liabilities tot@@ alled around 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euros ) .
&quot; at that time we were faced with the situation : are we carrying on or blocking the club ? &quot; said one of the defend@@ ants , in the bread profession of major financial institutions .
with his colleagues and co @-@ defend@@ ants he then decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , put our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in the detention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , there are no debts to be made .
furthermore , in case of a corresponding financial success , the reimbur@@ sement of expenses for reimbur@@ sement of expenses had been resolved retro@@ actively to 1991 .
therefore , a portion of the expense allowance was paid only years later , namely from 2003 when a plus on the account had been paid out .
therefore l@@ ump @-@ l@@ ump and not detailed bookings appeared , the former Ob@@ server explained the events .
the accounts and records administered the two defend@@ ants together , said the second defend@@ ant .
the judge asked why the expenses were not disclosed in detail by the association .
the association has not been interested in detail in the financial sector , it is important to have only the freedom of debt , the answer .
when , in 2011 , against the one function@@ ary investigation due to abuse of office , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
these were appropri@@ ations , declared the defend@@ ants .
this securities account was based on the name of the second defend@@ ant and , according to his statement , was not known to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know the answer for a long time .
then he said he thought that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor put in the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this directive was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claims for damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why in@@ dem@@ n@@ ity ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
the first defend@@ ant stated that he had not agreed with this formulation , because the association had never been damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this you are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary told him that he has never taken a cent salary , he only calcul@@ ates mil@@ eage and di@@ eting .
at diets , he took charge of the club 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort had been much higher , he added .
the indic@@ te@@ es were not able to show detailed records for the early years .
these were no longer kept after an operational inspection , in which everything was judged correctly , they declared .
o@@ dom@@ eter money also referred to the second defend@@ ant .
all the deport@@ ations were made in cash , so that he had to go to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence to the bank , he declared in his statement .
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September with the questioning of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard eng@@ ages another 30,000 jobs
in addition to the down@@ sizing of the company for three years , Compu@@ terri@@ ese will be able to reduce further jobs in the division of the company .
the positions at the US @-@ Compu@@ terri@@ fic H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) have no end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to cut down 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate client division .
as a result , costs tot@@ aling EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) were to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special charge of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will fall from the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 5@@ 5.000 jobs , which has been running for three years , has not yet been completed .
at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP still employed some 30@@ 2,000 associates .
on the stock exchange , the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard share delivered 2.3 percent .
the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto , which has become big with printers , is currently split up : the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led in a new company , separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services set the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to the latest .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers fell by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
thus , revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responds with spl@@ itting up and massive adjusting levels to change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only re@@ acted to the fact that customers increasingly purchase smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and do more and more business online .
overall , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age the reduction of approximately 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
however , a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would be largely rejection : 54 percent spoke against it , 35 percent were appro@@ ving .
the fact that other countries are flying air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive .
24 per cent are opposed to interven@@ ing in the conflict .
in cooperation with the Syrian authorities , Bach@@ ar el @-@ Assad , 51 percent of respon@@ dents denied that 20 percent would be responsible for this .
29 per cent could not decide .
car : second day of the press at 6@@ 6th IA@@ A
at the centre of the fair stand up to 27 September connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and electric mobility .
after two days of press conference , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Automobile Exhibition under the slogan &quot; Mobility Connect &quot; on Thursday .
the wide public can attend the IA@@ A from Saturday .
the organisers of the V@@ DA Verband , like two years ago , expect some 900 000 visitors .
R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke : violence erup@@ tion in Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police used the Serbian border near R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ √§n@@ eng@@ as and the water@@ front against several hundred refugees .
the news correspon@@ dent D@@ √°@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k witnessed the breach of violence at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it was a police line formed and a water lamp stood behind the polic@@ emen .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials stopped using pepper spray first .
after that , the police used Tr@@ √§n@@ eng@@ as .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now withdrawn a little while waiting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees gathered together and suffered under short@@ ness of breath .
the press spokes@@ men of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by using tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
the world ob@@ serves when the US Federal Reserve is coming together on two days , Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest is raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , the last week of the view that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates will last from 0 to 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest rate was on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Chief Executive Officer at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global conditions .
it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds against such a step are good .
the decision should be announced at 20.@@ 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
Delta State University died of ap@@ ology wrote ap@@ ology letter
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues later on the day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to tell him that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted , &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer in ge@@ ography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said he shot on someone and someone killed .
lamb said to the staff of the emergency call centre that the police must send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cute dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers for his name , but he didn &apos;t give him .
Lamb did not give any explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , saying , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted I could reverse it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note Lamb went 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen killed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb claimed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , officials said on Tuesday that there was &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said she was married for about seven years , as a &quot; good person . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who was 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I telep@@ hon@@ ed relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t go to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a polic@@ eman took him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb went on his car to the side , fled on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
in the spring of 2015 , Lamb received a doc@@ torate from the Delta State University , as his life @-@ law ad@@ mits to the University &apos;s website .

in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ time partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer .
the actor was also supposed to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug ownership .
all this is for sure its tribute .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa is expanding the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large group restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group plans to save half a billion euros a year on its own with a better organisation .
150 of the around 1,000 senior managers around the world will cost the workplace .
however , there are new negotiations with the pilot union .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and explo@@ iting the cheapest Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment was to generate a profit contribution of some 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , announced the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa is now no longer a member of the board of directors for the passenger business .
the airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
in the future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the executive board of chief Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr .
Spo@@ hr under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
up to now , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex .
the airlines operate under the roof of the passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of ‚Ç¨ 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the tari@@ ff conflict with the cockpit of the cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations will be resum@@ ed after the court @-@ stopped strike on this Thursday .
that divided the union .
the topic of the talks is supposed to be the retirement regulation for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a projected record result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wants to produce results as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and the airline led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the background is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; savings concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it seems that Lufthansa in the fight against competitors travels to the company &apos;s own cheap Eu@@ row@@ ings line .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven Champions League defeat at Manchester .
while this brought the left external def@@ enders to cry and will exclude him from playing for at least six months , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w will be able to play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ruth@@ less attack by H@@ √©@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w was broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg structure and lies in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operates in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , has very hard and then plays fantastic , and then that happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture then it takes six months and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno was happy to have escaped a red card and the im@@ position of an i@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , did not punish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbit@@ er had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself when I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a tweet to Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
related to this : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in defeat at PS@@ V
the UK distributor has an additional incentive to recover up to the coming June with the European Championship in France .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , everyone is very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al as the Netherlands team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very hard , because it wasn &apos;t his intention to hurt his opponent , and if you then hear that it is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked as if &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ √©s Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ der by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long until you know it almost by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , who appeared in 1971 , decided Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read to my children because it always seems to give a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron re@@ port@@ edly describes the plot of the book , has instead resum@@ ed an index of the 2012 film version , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; amid the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams , &quot; one reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name The@@ odor Se@@ uss ho@@ stage was lau@@ ded and died in 1991 , however completely unknown .
as if it wasn &apos;t suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the plot of the book . here , an un@@ named boy , like the local environment , will be rav@@ aged by the gre@@ edy , tree @-@ f@@ ading , th@@ ump@@ ing natur@@ es , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; despite the protests of the name of the name .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task has been deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row .
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said the text had probably come from Cameron &apos;s election circuit .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but no further direct comments were made .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly under threat from the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I wouldn &apos;t finish an out@@ going victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear scar@@ ring from 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali developed as spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown quantity at test @-@ level , is an option for the attack .
referring to this : Adam Ly@@ th is out of the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course hard to analyse for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
in his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results .
there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best sel@@ ections .
long ago , the course of Ly@@ th could have been extended , but he had control of his own destiny .
hopefully , if he kno@@ cks out further bor@@ ou@@ ghs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes .
the England coach Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss thank@@ ed his attitude even if he did not get such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team @-@ man .
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to put his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th received seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son in front of him - while Nick comp@@ ton received nine .
only comp@@ ton got the chance to go home and forward .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first used Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer that I set up high .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which hit us very well .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this naturally depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to suggest Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler and get four squ@@ e@@ aks , di@@ pped up , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t strike there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l of Cri@@ cket @-@ Player .
Mo@@ een might not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he joined the op@@ ener in 2001 .
he immediately made three hundred laps and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no big number of backup spi@@ ders who raise their hands and the trainers decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some smart additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful application to the setup .
I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela , he has insights from which we can profit .
sometimes new voices in the dressing room can bring fresh breeze even if the messages are in accordance with what has been said before .
Coll@@ ey &apos;s te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot got a similar break from Australia and I don &apos;t have a problem for my part .
some won &apos;t agree , but coaches and team rank@@ ings don &apos;t determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy .

David Cameron &apos;s un@@ declared ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to hold Britain in the EU gets deeper every day , even without the choice of genius Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which was viol@@ ently de@@ str@@ ust on Tuesday due to Europe .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at friend recently said that some member states are so deeply involved in various crises , such as the EU is now and not always of their own guilt , Britain itself created agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive contractual changes that they mostly do not want to be satisfied .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it , if it end@@ anger social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climbed to summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , making a photo of himself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care if we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her , as in the exagger@@ ated long endurance like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s Fran√ßois Hollande faces his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left .
it is difficult to imagine that they will be pulled out of one leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Brit@@ ons whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they do not want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore some such ministers may even deliberately not plan helpful ann@@ ot@@ ations , entirely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s refer@@ ral campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process susp@@ ects my boy@@ friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and what EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Press ar@@ one , however they were not during the referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 , which supported our admission 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can weak@@ ly remember Boris Johnson , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ Opport@@ uni@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who has made a name for himself as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 1990s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed Mili@@ band knew in all his ma@@ dness who were his enemies .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , telephone @-@ ch@@ op@@ pers and the pseu@@ do non @-@ nationals who have most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir actually thought about her , but found that when sitting with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , one better distri@@ butes ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of going to his lunch and dinner .
in fact Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir himself than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum vor@@ tex , because Bla@@ ir had the principle of the un@@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly collapse on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he had no more time for me to waste - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 1980s , an error at that time and today .
it may take but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ settee has left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position in Europe - I express it friendly - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff trend and the wild blood of Tor@@ y &apos;s Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ man can say yes to everyone .
it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV reported this week , when the boy sc@@ outs fought in him , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues without going too far and losing his Cab@@ inet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; remain under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their Monday evening cl@@ auses .
whatever the stir@@ red bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he has stir@@ red me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s right not to give Cameron a free pass for Europe that allows him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the refer@@ ee campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks like that .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s basic ambig@@ u@@ ities to EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato , Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to leave - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make concessions to the British when all this can be point@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military capacity in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which I remembered at the start of Monday by something called the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise public health report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts , who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , concluded Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic Law Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month gra@@ bbed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extremely wind@@ y foundation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to substanti@@ ate his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public expects that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people called to develop a model for multi @-@ criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to make their opinions about the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were sum@@ mar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously been received by British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting stated that they received funding from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding it was supposed to have received from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International in advance , they added .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the board are not supplied , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which include a sector funding in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
the tobacco direction of P@@ he took part in the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group &apos;s research work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acknow@@ le@@ dges that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for most products damage to most criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or limitations will be discussed in the P@@ he Report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; serving &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J was already re@@ acting to the claims of BM@@ J .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are considerably less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies on his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low in comparison to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
he has the un@@ ambig@@ uous obligation to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative danger compared to tobacco .
almost 80@@ ,000 people annually die of illness with respect to smoking , and smoking will cost the National healthcare system two billion pounds per year .
by clearly showing current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ on , says former boss of Channel 4
the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programmes like East@@ er@@ or The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square soap .
Johnson said the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs likely to be seen by a smaller audience in hard @-@ cont@@ ested time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and stations such as BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had been trying to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes are commissioned or sent , which would also be clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson in the communications committee on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , what I do not think for a good idea in the medium or long term , one should at least put his production on programs that others do not do or contract .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve as broad support as possible for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s of course non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax program is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ er is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I have to see how this is supposed to be public @-@ law television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series , led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC is on the hunt for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts are what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ ed@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows how to sell shows like East@@ ers .
Johnson said that the more public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they can argue if they go to their apparent missions to justify 4 billion pounds of broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we &apos;ve created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the committee on the broadcast fee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , all of you think we all think you get a big value for ¬£ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for the ¬£ 150 , ask me if that &apos;s true , because they do not consume much from the BBC .
former SK@@ Y@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also spoke out of the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check its Rei@@ thi@@ an mission , &quot; educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC production would be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example in &quot; inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain &quot; the public broad@@ caster in Australia and Canada .
to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of tel@@ ev@@ isions are shown , and with the commercial channels to make alliances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems , which can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment in which they are be@@ amed with sound pulses , which have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the pulses work through the power @-@ up of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new technique called Son@@ o@@ genetics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , Res@@ ear@@ cher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that the method of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
th@@ read@@ worms generally do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid containing micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 I@@ on channels and found in the membranes of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these I@@ on channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani has genetically modified the worms that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 I@@ on channels .
when he applies ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ ves@@ icles and transferred into the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the method has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics may have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that needs to be sent down to the desired place in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

but a separate campaign also leads to many posters , which can be seen at bus stops and in the subway trains and which require a second look .

the 300 posters are from artists who exhibited their work in the museum for cruel designs in Bank@@ sys Dis@@ mal@@ and .
a collective with the name Special Pat@@ rol Group helped in the distribution in London and used &quot; Ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks , &quot; a ¬£ 6 pack of bus keys , claimed to &quot; access to around one third of the bus stops advertising space on the planet . &quot;

one of the par@@ o@@ dy advertisements produced by Special Pat@@ rol Group .
according to Gav@@ in Gr@@ ind@@ on , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol Designs and Lec@@ turer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists become more critical and try to bring political work to the public outside galleries .
many artists turn to work with activists within protest movements and notice that they must go out into the real world , so that their art has an impact on society .

V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence around advertising for the Ce@@ ase@@ fire - by creating the Ce@@ L calendar - and thought , &quot; Let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic cy@@ ber corporate advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the blu@@ ei@@ sh with bright colors and animation , it remains to be stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es from Am@@ nesty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we need now is a step in the British government and the guarantee that torture instruments are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our front door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the most creative art around the ce@@ ase@@ fire comes from the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors are fantas@@ ying fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a press release , Sa@@ ab reveals an order by the U.S. Army over &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the AT@@ 4@@ CS RS , shot by the shoulder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; uniquely shaped &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vessel , which provides outstanding reflection effects within the target . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student resi@@ dences
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old I moved to a student residence , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral Rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I have been anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ term complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entrance to student residence halls ranges from slightly ner@@ ven@@ tively to absolutely sc@@ ary .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to sh@@ at@@ y : people tell where you come from , if and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ year , where you stand in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those you would not talk to , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people .
people &apos;s rooms are often transformed into drinks reception , movie night venues and local meeting points , but they are also places where people dress up and under@@ wear their under@@ wear .
referring to this : don &apos;t remember to start a relationship at university
intro@@ vert received a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences form a space @-@ to @-@ space b@@ um@@ mel culture that can be friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friend@@ ships .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I can get back the energy that I used to interact with you . &quot;
try to feel when a milit@@ ant of convi@@ vi@@ ality is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
talking about kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student residence halls had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friend@@ ships close through che@@ eks .
since you start the university at the height of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to imagine yourself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I &apos;ve baked something to you . so , and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain yourself and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
badly mixed l@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat cause people to sleep when you kno@@ ck .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of sp@@ le@@ en for your tea too ?
check this with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to serve themselves even when they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it more balanced than my room@@ mate who added a washing up liquid to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
it is not just about being a decent person , but that you belong in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb to the people sitting in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse .
a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbors , if it was something to make them a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more lou@@ der music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbours to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut her door and went to her three hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would accidentally move into the same student residence ?
on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be deeply embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future spouse , ran@@ som them , get rid of them and then see them every day and maybe experience how they are heading towards each other together ?
of course the heart goes its own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk a little reason to your abdom@@ en .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has left its keys in its not closed room , the border between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ bbing is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good coup is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never fail someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and put your keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but don &apos;t t@@ ack your possessions on the ceiling more than twice .
town@@ houses for refugees , single @-@ parents , low @-@ wage ear@@ ners
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ ler is building row houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living space , but also the solely educ@@ ating mother and the low @-@ ear@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build affordable and well today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will rush to the housing market .
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ ler believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds town@@ houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Gil@@ ler , many refugees will rush to the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ ler : mass accommodation in containers or gym@@ nasi@@ ums has no sustainability .
for the people remain a great deal here .
in view of the flood of refugees , we also need sufficient living space in the coming decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ ler : a terra@@ ced house needs least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if you put people in blocks of housing .
each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units each for four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge .
it can be that many refugees will say it is peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
guil@@ der : the price for 160 square metres of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 euros , without land .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
do the building regulations have complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ ler : I have completed my project correctly .
especially complicated is the threatening Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the parking ordin@@ ance regulation .
sp@@ ook@@ y .
it is still under@@ estimated who in a terra@@ ced house creates three apartments , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities there is a lack of space .
refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the residents respond to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ ler : there were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
which is definitely not right .
but do you not shar@@ pen the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ ler : it &apos;s true : over the last five years we had a construction boom in Germany , but we built luxury apartments , which can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the only educ@@ ating mother or the low @-@ ear@@ ner .
I &apos;ll show you how to build affordable and well today .
that is what it is all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by selecting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it &apos;s ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after installation , because they get an error message telling that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or try to update via iTunes .
the telephone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely due to the stream@@ lining of the update . likewise , it will be easier to do this by using a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worth to ensure that your mobile phone is charged while updating or is located near a charger so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued , as the phone may switch to half @-@ way and this may lead to a breakdown of the update .

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s sole motto : full attack
in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton , N@@ ico Ros@@ berg only knows a motto : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup second stressed before the start into the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the runner @-@ up champion before the night race in Singapore on this Sunday from tit@@ le@@ holder and two @-@ way champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on already won seven of the previous twelve races of the season and also takes the floo@@ d@@ light Grand Prix into the city state as a favourite in the city state .
in 2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Brit@@ on was able to win the race .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will influence the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; founded three months ago has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new member is Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , an entrepreneur , a passionate chess and tennis player who has stayed in Bad Kis@@ singen for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz 1 . class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ √ºb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation presi@@ ded over by Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot collect the membership fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent search should also be promoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of its solidarity with the spa town .
district office looking for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the elderly care centre Anton@@ isti@@ ft worked together under the clo@@ ak of the social foundation and opened a new place of contact with Count @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg Square .
in addition to consultations , one can also take part in courses .
the social foundation draws it down from the mountain to the city centre .
more specifically to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was opened there recently .
here , immediately next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and counsel@@ ors will receive information on questions such as care insurance or services of the health and care insur@@ ances .
for years we have been working with our ambul@@ ant care service to ensure that family members are often left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also not in@@ frequently many services of the insurance companies are not used because the complexity of insurance is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new landlord Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ is@@ ft and the B√ºrger@@ Insel@@ sp@@ ital as well as for the ambul@@ atory service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health and wellness .
for this purpose the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as prevention of fall prevention , memory training or a physi@@ o@@ therapeutic treatment can be used .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
both business executives see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre particularly in the demographic change .
this necess@@ it@@ ates a good decentr@@ alised infrastructure in the individual parts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
in addition , as mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations , the district office also devoted itself to the agreement with age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ able soci@@ alizing . &quot;
this makes the social foundation a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live independently and well in their familiar environment .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 pm to 6 pm and Saturday from 10 am to 12 pm .

Vienna architect Karl M@@ ang 92 years old ext@@ inct
Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Vienna &apos;s architecture , is dead .
he died on September 5 at the age of 92 , as the K√ºnstler@@ haus on Tuesday communicated .
with M@@ ang the K√ºnstler@@ haus left an honorary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most significant architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as was said in the field of foreign affairs .
born 1922 in Vienna , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna with Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War .
since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect , but also worked as a teacher , writer and director of the Institute .
from 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute of Design .

rebu@@ ke : Tim Wiese is throwing polic@@ ew@@ oman with money
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ex @-@ soccer ball &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tim Wiese is dis@@ liked in Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
foot@@ ball@@ ers once , meanwhile , Tim Wiese , former Nation@@ alt@@ or@@ h√º@@ ter in Germany and at Bremen and H@@ offen@@ heim are engaged , W@@ rest@@ ler .
according to his own statement , he wants to have laid 30 kilograms of muscle mass over the past two years .
on the other hand , he has not attributed intellectu@@ ally .
Wiese was leaving his hair in the city center of Bremen , when he saw a parking space guar@@ dian issued a ticket for his white Chev@@ ro@@ let Cam@@ aro .

in the city of Bremen , one confirms the alle@@ gations , but is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only then will it be decided whether meadow will be displayed , or not .

men beating over 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for an incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ m√ºn@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 am , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ m√ºn@@ ster .
one of the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an , followed the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the premises of the gas station .
one of these men now shou@@ ted to the young man and struck him with his fist .
the victim suffered a nose @-@ bone and bleeding heavily from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the thu@@ gs , he first left his victim .
the injured young man was brought home by his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a car up to their apartment and passed by demonstr@@ atively several times .
when you didn &apos;t see the car any more , the injured went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the m@@ allet and another male person .
with the help of a stock@@ pile we checked the victim &apos;s face and thi@@ ghs .
the injured had to be brought to hospital for medical care .
so far , only a vag@@ ue perpetr@@ ator &apos;s description lies ahead .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters tall .
the second bat should have been about 1.@@ 65 meters in size and was clothed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police ask witnesses and sign@@ ers to report on the phone number 06@@ 18@@ 1 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank M√ºller to acquire field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank M√ºller ( from left ) assume the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ic@@ ausen .
the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , business suppor@@ ter U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy about this .
in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing : Dr. Frank M√ºller takes over the practice Fel@@ ce@@ ausen on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ den@@ ausen reti@@ res , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on his way to his successor in the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase M√ºller opened the practice on October 12 , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises on the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ stra√üe 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight , when the ri@@ ms met Frank M√ºller and his wife Dr. Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l who are currently completing their specialist education in the Ver@@ den Hospital and who also wants to enter into practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mil@@ ler would fit into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ici@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I was so far , I just called her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German couple M√ºller liked the idea of running their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says 39 @-@ year @-@ old mil@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage he also sees his own boss soon .
and so they agreed that the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with the practice .
however , they continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time father Frank M√ºller was also raised , his medical studies in Hannover followed several medical practices and in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as Senior Physi@@ cian in Sul@@ ingen . in 2009 he was appointed Princip@@ al Consul@@ tant in Di@@ ep@@ holz and is involved in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the practice will be prepared for the new boss as of September 19 .
while Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Feld@@ steh@@ ausen works as a family physician , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ ist ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the mil@@ ler , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as home doctors .
&quot; the endos@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l .
after the renovation the rooms look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
the mil@@ ler will receive a total of 50@@ 000 euros in the framework of a funding program from the administrative district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as from the joint municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and glad we are that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes Sam@@ vet Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2,000 patients come to the field of field breaks every quarter , in the northern German average practice it is approximately 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another GP practice .
a positive side effect of the practical acquisition by Frank M√ºller : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen .
if no successor was found , it would have gone too .
those who attend M√ºll@@ ers &quot; consultations are still looking at familiar faces : the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power from the fields of the field .
with their departure in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all the doctors have practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ici@@ ausen recalls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long time , they already feel a little melanch@@ oly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will surely see many patients more often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the journalist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , I &apos;ve always pressed myself on gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we let the refugees go through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also raised at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the controls at the Hungarian border are maintained parallel to this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear that everyone who wants to put an asylum claim can do so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people stand in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , nor about the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses
the Croatian government had previously announced that also Slovenia wants to leave incoming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and , under certain circumstances , also establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
the Minister of Interior Ves@@ na Gy@@ √∂r@@ k√∂@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however , did not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia will rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - above all to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by contrast , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the boundary of the Schengen area .
as the minister stressed , Slovenia doesn &apos;t want to lock its borders for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill out its commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ √∂r@@ k√∂@@ s Z@@ no@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like the Croatian government , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours on Tuesday to leave in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid registration .
the c@@ roati@@ an police were able to pick them up in the nearby fields of corn .
according to local media ever police vehicles with new refugees arrive at the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is primarily intended for Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in operation .
in the coming days , his country accounts for about 4000 refugees , said Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were re@@ directed towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade denied , however , that it was possible for people to adopt certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do so , &quot; he said .
according to the media reports , in the morning , a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses were expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were on the way through Serbia all night long from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border around 500 kilometers away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary has agreed , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could actually lead to a postpon@@ ed shift in the former Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west @-@ west route .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive border control possibilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic stressed that his country had prepared corresponding plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
he did not refer to details , but pointed out that as a non @-@ Schengen member , Croatia has &quot; comprehensive options for border control . &quot;
strict controls are carried out in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia has been a member of this since 2007 , and since then the EU partners have consistently issued a good testimony regarding the standard of border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Serbian side there are about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm down Wednesday morning with a local cou@@ pon in Hor@@ gos : he kept the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature .
it would not be about very high quantities of refugees at this time .
one could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe : in parts of the bor@@ der@@ land there are even 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .
stock H@@ acker : Ukra@@ inians number 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard a ring of cy@@ ber criminal that has been accused of having gained an insight into un@@ published financial statements and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the information captured , insi@@ ders &apos; businesses should have been made to the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , a total of over 100 million dollars were launched to the investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated in the SE@@ C message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trial against 32 other defend@@ ants in the case continued .
most of the accused are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators should have acted in both the US and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Aid Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
there is a lively operation around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz .
the people do their err@@ ands , partly fast pac@@ ing , partly co@@ z@@ ily stro@@ lling .
you control the two stations of the Mannheim car park at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep city tracks down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; puls@@ ating , boun@@ cing life with wonderful autumn sunlight and in the midst of four large panels each with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Before I die I want to die .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce has drawn attention to its 20th anniversary with this action and is quite confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Help is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and discussions like the volunteers .
while some pass@@ ers spontaneously go to the chal@@ k and affir@@ m the sentence about &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; stopping the war , &quot; &quot; stopping the war &quot; or &quot; not suffering long , &quot; others are short , read , say sentences like &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and then go on .
again and again on the br@@ ink there are small discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ √ºb@@ inger is also on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I realize that for me eventually the end of this world comes , I can live responsible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; di@@ ac@@ on@@ ical work Mannheim &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband Tr√§ger des √ñ@@ kum@@ en@@ ische Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , this public @-@ effective action for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good .
the fact that not everyone wants to communicate openly on the boards , is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing .
the subject of death and dying may still be frau@@ ght with tab@@ oos , such as the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the Hos@@ pi@@ ce Movement in recent years has contributed a great deal to the opening up of people .
an app@@ rais@@ al that An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid shares .

when ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce was calling for volunteers by calling , she immediately reported it and had been there when she was founded in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and their relatives in private homes , hospitals , nursing homes and in the Hos@@ pi@@ ce Saint Vincent .
they are all carefully trained .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid can deal well with her task and the experiences and experiences he has made .

F@@ ed@@ Ex result shu@@ ff@@ led , financial outlook for 2016 reduced
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the delivery gi@@ ants boo@@ sted its profit prospects for a whole year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its bo@@ d@@ land transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for their holidays .
at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by more than 2.5 percent in the after@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said earning a profit between 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the fiscal year ending in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous pre@@ diction .
according to a survey conducted by Fac@@ t@@ Set , analysts expected $ 10,@@ 84 .
the lower outlook , despite the price increases , is 4.@@ 9 percent on average and will be effective on 4 January and despite higher allow@@ ances for bo@@ d@@ land transport of heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result would increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and growth in online trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; produces solid earnings when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for vacation employment were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , who plans to hire 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year .
in the first quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex consolidated 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just below $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which analysts predicted 12 analysts from Z@@ ack Investment Research .
sales rose by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of the analysts questioned eval@@ utes expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
over the past few years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , bringing sales in its unit express shipping to stagn@@ ate .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales in Bod@@ hau@@ lage rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self insurance .
the express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result fell due to higher labour costs in the freight business .
in the after@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
at its most expected conference in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to raise the body for the first time for almost a decade .
threatening about them at an end of the decorated , two @-@ storey meeting hall is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed presi@@ dency Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation ahead of all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold order from the Congress : maxim@@ ising U.S. employment and prices here stable .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict . it will be announced on Thursday that the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented incentives by the close @-@ to @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data in the economy show that it grows soli@@ dly , the latest turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives afraid to increase this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal securities - and be it just a quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing to observe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Chief Econom@@ ist at the Estate firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text not to increase interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue waiting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which uns@@ ett@@ les the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently questioned by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase in interest this week .
the financial markets , however , expect the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator that only shows a 30 % chance of up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment .
this indicates a drop in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mi@@ tig@@ ate the blow by promising that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage sized 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , she would have to go very far in her declaration to calm the financial markets so that they won &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that increasing interest rate would calm the financial markets because they would remove uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
one month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the rate by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow intensi@@ fication of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the sentence was expected .
although the job creation slow@@ ed in August , the improvement on the labour market this year was solid .
the unemployment rate declined to 5.1 % in the past month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary impact of much lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chief Econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world came together at the end of the last month , after China had de@@ valu@@ ated its currency .
in May , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % below its peak when investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would stran@@ gle global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , with the Dow now being nearly 10 % below the May pole .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market tur@@ mo@@ il influences complex calculation , when the interest should be increased .
&quot; if events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the past few weeks , they would tigh@@ ten the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US Federal Reserve .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the effects on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included in the decision @-@ making process .
but in the end the F@@ ed has become the F@@ ed Monetary Authority of the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the mere hint of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow down their monetary expansion , &quot; triggered turbul@@ ations around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , F@@ ed representatives can expect them not only to monitor developments elsewhere , but also to consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of Global Strategy for En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA , re@@ marked this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that apparently are not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
lacquer , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which advoc@@ ates a rise in interest rates , quoted decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to reduce their interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited noticeable effects on growth in the U.S. , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lack@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later , the F@@ ed representatives did not reverse these cuts .
the F@@ ed should only place aspects of financial stability in the first place during a serious crisis such as the 2008 market mer@@ gence , &quot; said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on Inter@@ est Reg@@ ulations of Bank of England .
the recent turbul@@ ence does not come close to that level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a rise in interest because markets are upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until this is am@@ ended , I do not believe that it should ha@@ sten the time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
preparing a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine are among them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still loves to teach her 74 L@@ ess@@ ons .
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seekers home on the D@@ ill@@ inger Strasse .
there she helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German .
of course , the whole of other classes is different than at a proper school .
Rio Grande &apos;s pedi@@ atric community promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS tries to educ@@ ate women in a sho@@ cking way to educ@@ ate women about how important good nutrition is during the lac@@ tation period . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who su@@ ck at breasts which are painted with portra@@ y@@ als of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should undertake .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new amber sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried allowed the building application for the ‚Ç¨ 2.3 million sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be flat for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ awaited hor@@ sem@@ a building at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Centre is progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent council session the elabor@@ ated building application was unanim@@ ously approved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; previously , among other things , the committee adopted a proposal for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the valid construction plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the permission was given for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with a top and roof top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be erected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the planned use of the roof surface for solar systems is the background of the planning : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through this we get together a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was again about the roof ti@@ lt that for energy reasons - unlike in the construction plan - should lie under ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the construction plan regarding the roof ti@@ lt did not allow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; whereby the member of the municipal council usually is more restric@@ tive in terms of freedom of liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , this is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym@@ nasi@@ um building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
costs are estimated to be around 2.3 million euros .
subsidies are expected from school and mass sports promotion .
in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall will now be presented to the Office of the Land@@ rats@@ amt ( Land@@ rats@@ amt ) .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of staff move from P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , who confirmed the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü .
however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board , and the meeting will be postpon@@ ed on Wednesday , 23 September .
should the plans be implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg would continue to work .
the vast majority should move with Fischer and the still existing inside station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
employees who cannot come to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü .
the employees were informed about the plans .
the change of notice from Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year , has now changed to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play on the question of who to succeed him , who agreed to take the lead on 1 October and change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means an &quot; appreciation &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the area of Internal Medicine , &quot; said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the inside station .
for the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees , will lead both houses until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ schaft , which has more than 35 beds , is to be closed permanently in P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , when the currently ongoing renovation was completed at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital .
Coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , res@@ igned against rum@@ ours that the house , owned by the federal government , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü could not say that there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is currently a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a day psychology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity will not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer about the quasi @-@ move to the Le@@ ch , which was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positively and very understandable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as head physician for more than 30 years .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
in the past decades , the P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg Hospital ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened with closure and departments have been closed , for example the surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .

hunting season with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been severely injured during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several hunters were in use , as the police informed .
after a shot , an 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospital .
at first it was unclear how exactly the accident occurred .
the det@@ ective police determined .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ pse of 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
in interro@@ gation , the 20 year old admitted that the young people were killed and their bodies thrown into a canal in Rock@@ h@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who has been missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to violent crimes .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ h@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as the public prosec@@ utor and police wed@@ ded on Wednesday .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , also arrested on Tuesday evening , is considered to be a suspect , who , in fact , conf@@ essed the statement and led the investig@@ ators to the place of discovery of the cor@@ pse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she hadn &apos;t come home after a visit to a autumn festival in Rock@@ house .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first encountered personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
during interro@@ gations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing persons , a crime suspicion was finally found against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ h@@ ausen , where the cor@@ pse was found .
the det@@ ain@@ ee told the authorities in police interro@@ gation to kill the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the cor@@ pse on the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was supposed to be led to the port fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him to death .
the further investigation is intended to shed light on the closer circumstances of the act .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing short@@ falls
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is faced with a challenge .
the distribution of distribution on the German housing market has long since begun .
with the incoming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable apartments .
in order to meet demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a study commissioned by the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social H@@ ousing Building &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes to this conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison : in Germany , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are completed .
a total of 140@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings are missing .
after the first three months of their stay refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial housing .
many then come across the housing market and join the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year .
the negative development of the housing market , however , is not only due to the rising number of refugees .
the study also makes significant om@@ is@@ sions in the housing development policy of recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany is moving an apartment deficit , increasing from year to year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present , some 77@@ ,000 residential units have already been missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Gu@@ en@@ ther , author of the study , compla@@ ins .
many professionals were therefore forced to live in large cities in WG rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults remained un@@ tarily over the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the dol@@ drums on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita has declined again for the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social H@@ ousing Construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a restart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , new incentives should boost housing development .
thus , the property tax tax could be wai@@ ved and the basic tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed apartments can be suspended for a limited time .
in addition , attractive fiscal write @-@ downs are necessary according to the Alliance .
the funding programme for state bank Kf@@ W refugees is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the launch , more than half of the remaining 300 million euros had already been retri@@ eved on Monday evening , with a total of ‚Ç¨ 18@@ 4 million .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free access : Croatia and Slovenia align corridor
there is practically no access to Hungary , since more and more refugees are choosing the way to Croatia .
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the transit through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke to the Sloven@@ ian Minister of the Interior , and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the deportation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to escape from there to Western Europe .
500 people came across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reported the Croatian television station RT@@ L .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the day before . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new laws that entered into force on the same day , moreover , abol@@ ish ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic asser@@ ted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can go through , and we prepare ourselves for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , it was people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the c@@ roati@@ an police picked up the first refugees at the Serbia border on the border of Serbia in the morning .
most of the media reports are based on Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they arrived with the bus as well as with taxis in the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to walk on foot over the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not come across borders .
but the border strip poses other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mine clear@@ ers are now to quickly create a safe passage .
however , after the closure of the border no more refugees come to Hungary .
on Tuesday , the police numbered 3@@ 66 cont@@ ested people .
shortly before closing on Monday , there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws prescri@@ be the overcoming and damage of the border between us as a crime .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the border town Sz@@ eg@@ ed in the southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
sentenced to five years imprisonment and deportation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the &quot; tran@@ se@@ des &quot; established at the border , of which almost all - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees there .
in practice , however , no one has a chance to obtain asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up in R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the rub@@ b@@ ish which tens of thousands of people had left on the road@@ side in the past weeks .
barriers were disman@@ tled and one of the camps in the border area was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to express themselves at the goal of this conversion .
after closing the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria only reached a few refugees .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
but around the 20,000 migrants , according to government information , they still remained in the country .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the continuation of the journey to Germany .
the train from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the instruction of German authorities .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing we regularly met smaller groups of refugees on foot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mayor drove &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; str@@ and@@ ete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; across the border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the bridge festival on Sunday we were occupied with ti@@ dying out when suddenly ten people were standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly set the rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the flood of refugees , it was the end for them in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; so Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the border together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the nearby Passa@@ u .
prior to that , we once covered the unexpected guests , with snack and drinks .
we said right away , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ √ñ@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man refused to give a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers were switched to a regional train on Sunday evening in W@@ els by an ICE in a regional train in the direction of Passa@@ u . after the announcement that the railway traffic to Germany was stopped , it was still trying to cross the border .
but the regional train was placed at the Inn before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Br√º@@ cken@@ fest linked with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , the day before a two @-@ brid@@ ging sport - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ √°n is sending further tens of thousands to us is a logical result of hypo@@ critical policy :
instead of helping to establish structures in the camp of R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke , our German chan@@ cell@@ or acknowledged the position of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ circle of National Socialism .
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions in the bor@@ der@@ lands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even the refugees will have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has invited them and welcomed them , is nothing but a further refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter , to produce decent conditions for asylum seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be an even greater one - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad searching for 35@@ ,000 winter@@ proof Quar@@ ters
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the support of refugees , Konrad has to do all his hands full . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Konrad used to know that his word has a weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to place arti@@ llery for the thousands of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chaos in the original reception centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Con@@ rad .
&quot; we have no homeless in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he said of his first success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was also without great fuss , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master@@ stroke &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad reck@@ ons with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ igen year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodation units have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 should provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal states .
should there be more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without soil , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the state tri@@ bun@@ als .
these would have assured him of creating quarters for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things are going well in Upper Austria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ator supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Sch√∂n@@ born , who will explain how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator sets high expectations also in the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Help like us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform private individuals can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty during the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of need it could not be that quarters of the district must comply with a certain amount of the towel rack or the size of the sky@@ lights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply for a temporary period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Interior Ministry , he is more successful in accommodation , Konrad bases his experience .
I am an older gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood .
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier are not responsible for the Republic as they declared themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
up to now , my own neighborhood search hasn &apos;t been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to place a container on the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz demands a better distribution
for the time being , no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design center for refugees planning is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , as it is possible to do so without these measures , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further sites are to be tested for their suit@@ ability .
the city chief has critic@@ ised the division of refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; boundaries are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ √ºhr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday called for further action in the refugee issue .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders will not be smu@@ g@@ gled .
the continuation of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany .
however , the asylum seekers would return to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ √ºhr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria now carries out controls at its borders is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new shi@@ py@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Linz industrial line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group has moved into S &amp; T , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square metres ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine investing in the startup companies of the New shi@@ py@@ ard and later also to acquire them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
‚Ç¨ 1.7 million was invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is rented from Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of remaining space in the building are already rented out , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ propriet@@ or opened a second shop in the ar@@ cade
Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are the centre of attention in the new shop .
actually Jut@@ ta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ad , the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni had to put an end to this project : after all , she now has an increase in the form of another business area .
in the Fur@@ la shop over the shop where they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes of various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags from the Fur@@ la brand , pur@@ ses are available from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories will cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks have been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long thought if I should still open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of an own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz area that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who have even Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her mode of interest has been raised from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
I am deaf to the most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women when looking at a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , the expert can &apos;t answer with last certainty either .
maybe it &apos;s because a beautiful bag enhances every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
this feature also connects some with the billi@@ on@@ aire , who wants to become U.S. president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ sets .
whether he expresses himself in a foreign hos@@ tility , concerns journalists or gaps in knowledge in international crisis policies - the candidate for the U.S. Pres@@ i@@ dency s@@ wir@@ ls the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cuts off well .
this is also recorded in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ √∂hn@@ fris@@ ur &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is well known in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine road . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant @-@ village is related to it over -@@ nin@@ ety corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ st√§d@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the villa@@ gers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ st√§d@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous children , including Tr@@ ump and the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he certainly would be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he didn &apos;t bring it to the king of his heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; though there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to think that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is already a bit a big mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in High German : the investors , says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the investors .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 , when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the corner@@ stone of the real estate group were first real estate purchases in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed at the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time .
he did not take Tr@@ ump because he was once cut off without hom@@ olog@@ ation , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Eth@@ no@@ graphy , Roland Paul , declared the start of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal immig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the occasionally br@@ anded statements of the descend@@ ant .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the pole , it is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of the tr@@ ump ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The grand@@ ma was a born b@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the v@@ int@@ ner in retirement looks rather dist@@ anced from the American , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so up@@ lifting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared for K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pen@@ sion@@ er Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz &apos;s family gave a visit to the church organ during a visit , which was generally good .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be better if he didn &apos;t know the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had sa@@ ws at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like he , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting themes than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ ra@@ chter Sarah B√ºh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not my president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe even without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 movies , also in the USA awakening interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper Bavaria congregation of Ram@@ sau with Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 1800 inhabitants of the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den national park received the award for soft tourism from the vice @-@ president &apos;s hand at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ bers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in neighbouring countries , the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sunrise dominates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son are moving to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there has not been much shifts in today &apos;s ratings .
the breakfast show by N@@ ine was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull made the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sunrise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a week @-@ long series of international television programmes including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this draw@@ back of the uprising did not seem to play a role for Australian TV viewers , as Sunrise achieved an average of 39@@ 7.@@ 000 viewers in the five capitals , compared with Today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today , Today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , Today , the gap to Sunrise was closed .
in August today , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 3@@ 30,000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year the distance was between 40,000 and 50.000 .
until now , sunrise will be available on an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at Today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change concern these morning men more than Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently wit@@ ty father , who decides to settle down with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ts star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening responded with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven stayed strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and easily hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Family ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5 : 30 p.m. ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe scored an average of 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ 000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia scored 5@@ 20,000 people and 7@@ 20,000 in the second half hour .
average Hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ seed will ultimately prevail at 5 : 30 p.m .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars a minute that didn &apos;t manage to over@@ run the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
mystery revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki have probably un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who wins the Bachelor &apos;s .
the woman , at which Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor , was sh@@ rou@@ ded in greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who has received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows the day before three two , you might inad@@ vert@@ ently have given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips tightly sealed until the final on Thursday
all three women have expressed themselves in a ly@@ rical way why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked , &quot; If not you , who should get the last rose ? &quot; could their answers become a per@@ ni@@ b@@ ance who won the heart of the Bachel@@ ors .
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both quickly named - apart from themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from day one .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and notic@@ ing ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams energies , I sen@@ sed that they were quite compatible and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah is on Earth at both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week made her clear that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be one &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now set on him without reservation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked wh@@ om@@ ever Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zzling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the b@@ achel@@ or &apos;s will be broad@@ cast@@ ed on Wednesday at 7 : 30 pm .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ ush@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the Bank when he lost a don@@ ka as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ sions on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ ush@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a return return and also to the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ ush@@ a still showed his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
in his press conference , Tom@@ ush@@ a also strengthened his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his missed catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian ent@@ our@@ age had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a po@@ orer start in his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne resem@@ bled the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut then in 2007 , when a pass came to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

at the beginning of the F@@ W Aut@@ umn War in Wall@@ stadt , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned against a severe crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , when there are no correspon@@ d@@ ingly new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools from collapse , &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said .
&quot; otherwise we will get distor@@ tions in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the Land@@ tag fraction of the Free voters days to Friday in the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune .
in fact , other major topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free voters &apos; meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lay the clo@@ ister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ai@@ van@@ ger called for the establishment of UN shel@@ ters for refugees in Syria , just as they were during the Yugoslavia war in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the free voters chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rejected asylum seekers want to post@@ p@@ one the Free voters as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more personnel for the administrative courts responsible for asylum proceedings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum judges , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W chief critici@@ zed that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards of federal states throughout Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria obli@@ ges , others not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to become more powerful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the country &apos;s policies should not fall under the table .
a long @-@ lasting bur@@ ners are on the agenda : the education policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the new school year , the Minister of Culture , Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Medium @-@ level plus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at 47 grammar schools in which an extension of the secondary school intermediate level is tested for three to four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this is not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for freedom of choice for all gym@@ nasi@@ ums that want this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
free travel at G@@ 9 wherever desired .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many stock exchanges reck@@ on that the markets will be on the spot until after the interest rate decision in the US and also for the large decline in the fut@@ ures parties . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German energy companies may lack 30 billion euros of provisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered slightly , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .

according to this , investors pay little attention to the German chip@@ maker .
in doing so , investment in promising w@@ afer technologies and focus on the automotive market should be paid out .
car figures were in demand : even in August , even in the traditionally weak summer month of August , more cars were sold than in the same period of the previous year , as the industry association AC@@ EA announced at the start of the International Motor Show IA@@ A in Frankfurt .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in Southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets against the proposed new constitution , said a civil servant on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ el@@ ong@@ i district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Chief District Officer , said that more than 1,000 prot@@ esters had gathered outside a police station with some of them throwing stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resor@@ ting to rubber sho@@ cks .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber floors were known to be able to kill , but they were traditionally used as a less le@@ thal alternative , apparently producing such a high death rate .
the debate was the last one in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ ri@@ ans say that new provinces , formed under the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence .
there were protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th .
August was killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been centrally governed for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the law@@ makers ha@@ sten@@ ed the trial after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legis@@ lators have voted this week for certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
construction site planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square metre area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet .
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den intends to market an area around 4000 square meters in direct neighbourhood to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
the plan is to use the premises for a mix of trade , commerce and housing .
one has to wait for suitable offers , it says on the part of the city .
which investor demand is not yet clear .
correspon@@ d@@ ingly , no contracts had been concluded .
the city of Em@@ den had a part of the property located at the ring road / corner Big street , already bought a few months ago and leaving the building on it .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for a holiday settlement on the small sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
some residents are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure activities
for months , behind closed doors has been negotiated , p@@ onder@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now there are plans for a new holiday resort on the Little Sea near Em@@ den on the table .
the Inter@@ est , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ der Company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented his plans for the first time on Monday evening in the City Development Committee of the Em@@ de Council .
originally this point had stood on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP faction , which accused the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends went on the offensive from the system building management : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said in front of the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all the rum@@ ours now .
the ten to twelve million euro project has been in discussion for months .
violent reactions among sea @-@ bu@@ d owners who had come to the meeting brought the pictures and new details to the desired hotel building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the Meer@@ bus@@ den@@ owner and board member of the advoc@@ acy group of the An@@ gli@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be a giant cl@@ ot@@ z that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears , like several other project critics , that the traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all buses will have to come to expect this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , what is happening on the well one hect@@ are area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still lacking , the development plans were still variable .

Google launches a dou@@ bling donation campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign that aims to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have over@@ run the European nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donation call on its blog .
instead of making a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , wrote about her personal experiences when she was seven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey included many dark railway and bus cru@@ ises , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million at goo@@ gle@@ .com / are rede@@ emed to $ 11 million .
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many were also fle@@ eing from the war torn by war , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

for slightly overweight diabe@@ tics weight loss surgery may be helpful .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say if lightly obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial on the new J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery study .
weight loss surgery or obesity , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb nutrition .
over the years , obesity treatments have proven to be efficient for type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been conducted in people who are path@@ ologically obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and stomach cu@@ st@@ ula - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I of those undergoing this surgery fell from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately at 29 .
among those who underwent surgical procedure , 36 % dis@@ infected the diabetes condition and at 28 % partially .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes was completely dissolved in only one percent and in some cases only about two percent .
in addition , the results of the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol were generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the patient blood level of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation , the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical treatment group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce the mortality rate in five years , according to the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared the average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the host rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching larger responses in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.2 % ) and reported a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show survival benefit after five years , there are indications from a study of heavy people in Sweden that surgery results in a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , obes@@ e people who underwent adi@@ posit@@ as surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soothing for individuals with a BM@@ I less than 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think once they have accumulated those genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story takes place in the H@@ uns@@ r√ºck
it is an issue that currently attracts attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets after years the sho@@ al of her youth , and she falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recent novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel might be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ r√ºck readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she was able to set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europe cannot accept all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama , and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East lies .
the Tibetan Buddhist leader demanded an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , focusing on ethics .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in addressing the crisis , he stressed that it was just a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , like real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we need to think about how the killing in their countries is reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 and pointed out that the violent reaction of the US drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
quad@@ ru@@ ple increase of intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the past 4 years
poison control centres in the US report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age who swallow strong alcoholic hand dis@@ infection products , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of in@@ comes of disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years , the poison control centres report , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them end up in emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said some children are inten@@ tional to drink dis@@ infection , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a sample of social media .
videos on YouTube show how juven@@ ile dis@@ infection products only drink because of a cheap experience .
young people allegedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with soft mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive fragran@@ ces of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very appealing to children .
hand dis@@ infection products contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in small children , only a few sp@@ lashes of alcohol can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as Hospital , the Fox 4 transmitter in K@@ ansa City .
so , you would not leave a si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , then it is a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sp@@ lashes of straw@@ berry and disinf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was brought to the treatment in an emergency .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally considered as drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency physician who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah fl@@ ushed her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of bra@@ ins , as the girl was fallen by alcohol and pushed the head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ nat@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs Mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and to store hands @-@ free disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
in addition to alcohol pois@@ oning , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario after swal@@ lowing hand dis@@ infection agents containing toxic , non @-@ declared ingredients .
employees of health authorities suggest that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth class in the state of New York planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by spreading anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them out of their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police viewed the sha@@ ky plan as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mess &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and showed disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Griff@@ i@@ ths plays talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
there are rum@@ ours about disc@@ ord at Celtic Glasgow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths spontaneously . this insi@@ sted that he and his team mates are not under increased control as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football is bored by Dut@@ ch@@ man - de Bo@@ er
the former ran@@ ger mid @-@ field player and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of Celtic games any more and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here talk not only about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they &apos;re interested in .
there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian chef s@@ wore to turn things back .
after the defeat against Malm@@ √∂ and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ men from Aber@@ deen , which now stands at the top of the table with five points of lead , followed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel it exactly this way - but we must go on .
we really need the support from Celtic , because that makes the players better .
standing now is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton careful with January transfers
despite his comments just a few weeks ago , suggest@@ ing that he ha@@ sten@@ ed some January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ Boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is war@@ y of the signing of new entran@@ ts and insi@@ sts that he does not want to distur@@ b the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x cad@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players who come in the summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you saw with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Celtic target person Mich@@ u with reference guide
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ St√ºr@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer period in conversation , indicated he could withdraw when his contract exp@@ ires at the Sw@@ ans .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been pla@@ gu@@ ed with a troubles@@ ome k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les for two years and has not abol@@ ished the passage from Wales this summer .
Hear@@ ts on S@@ FA battle set for N@@ eil@@ bad comments
the Hear@@ ts led 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and lost 3 : 2 , but the defender &apos;s Red Card was later rev@@ oked - the third red card by Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
N@@ eil@@ son remains with what he said and insi@@ sts : &quot; I have no question of integrity , I have no comment on it . &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid Ty@@ te@@ ast@@ le
the incor@@ rigi@@ ble Hi@@ bee was re@@ buff@@ ed after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive texts about ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the area of Ros@@ eb@@ urn of Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ te@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; it was a der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; said the St√ºr@@ mer , and added , &quot; It is safe to say that I will not return to Ty@@ te@@ ast@@ le if it does not play for Celtic Glasgow . &quot;
Tan@@ na@@ dice Supervisory Board has trust in Dun@@ dee United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United &apos;s Executive Board still has confidence in the management team to turn things - but admit that the decline in the field must end .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the guys back to Tra@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Inn@@ es is happy to win against Hamilton . &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team from Aber@@ deen desper@@ ately strug@@ gled to fight Hamilton Heights to see a seventh consecutive league victory , which led them a five @-@ point lead on the upper edge of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is no team that has won everything , in cups or le@@ agues that haven &apos;t won the games of this kind either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while the United Kingdom increases overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without labor for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above the 5.5 per cent of the U@@ K@@ s , as the figures of the National Statisti@@ cs Office ( ON@@ S ) showed .
in the meantime , jobs in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a number above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The government &apos;s long @-@ term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year since Scotland has taken the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unk@@ ards interfer@@ ed with the process
because the security guards were unable to paci@@ fy the situation , the police called the police .
only with the use of pepper spray could the officials take the stor@@ ks into custody .
a breath alcohol test was 0.@@ 89 per mil@@ le at a 16 @-@ year @-@ old .
the adol@@ escent was picked up by his mother .

why I &apos;m witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
a little later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see a man being brought to death .
if it happens and I hope it does not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ sy is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and as many more applications are available as places , a more mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery will take place in order to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
those who are selected will observe it emotion@@ ally .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ sy &apos;s closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of aband@@ oning my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could have been better form@@ ulate &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Glos@@ sy had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go into details here again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ sy is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that there is a strong likel@@ ihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters who can contact you .
what you get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death .
man after wet police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the C@@ anning River
the c@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he talked to the man of the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to det@@ ach the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters away from a police officer trying to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale were sum@@ mon@@ ed to a local breach incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ si@@ vec was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned to a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negotiating . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
master football player Ben c@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car in the dit@@ ch to escape a alcohol control and then tried to swim across the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threatened to end racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to end the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity division of Racing Victoria and claimed that she conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching from Lady Tat@@ i for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions than it was about the positive cobal@@ t t@@ amp@@ er test near Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had held back 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ onage charges and did not want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like over@@ hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it and I sat down for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk up@@ stairs and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
when they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be more trainers .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
prior to that , M@@ oo@@ dy had made the bomb blast in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity division tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart stayed in a room with a man - whom I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing@@ .com .
they obviously believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if that is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses , because they failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former President of R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , reign@@ ing President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should this bring me to the conclusion that it becomes personal ?
did the R@@ V@@ L behave cow@@ ard@@ ly and maybe make people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
maybe they have to take my license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now letting them think about it .
but I am now at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainers &apos;s frustr@@ ations have been built up with the long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ defeated Master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse &apos;s deb@@ ands , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my colleagues mistakenly put mud on the leg .
it could have been so last night .
it could have been the whole day as it was yesterday .
but it was also the same on the day of the race .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy op@@ ts against ri@@ vals due to claims to ring fight back
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has called criticism of the Tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; of two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the ump@@ ires allowed the Storm players &quot; Ring Games &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a barely concealed remark about the Storm team after his team achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in w@@ rest@@ ling .
Bell@@ amy defended the tac@@ kling of his team and said she only concentrated on her contact with the tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy added that the critics of two leading trainers at his team agree with him as it means they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always appears - I didn &apos;t hear Tr@@ ent Robinson said about fights when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that throughout the year we have not changed our defensive system or techniques . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles a real focus and this has provided us with the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not accustomed to losing , so it was a bit shock to him .
it &apos;s funny how this occurs again and again at this time of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Benn@@ etts has attacked Benn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts and St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wa@@ yne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting she was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he will take care of a sc@@ andal .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players at their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like these .
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ co against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are there breaks and don &apos;t points anything exciting ?
for me it &apos;s the game boards .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase .
the Storm team has won this weekend , because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday night in the pen@@ ultimate at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
serve with $ 200,000 Guarant@@ eed for Dru@@ gs
a man who could possibly have a life @-@ long sentence due to his attempt to get into possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a $ 200,000 deposit .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed as he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later in the Caf√© Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a potentially viable punishment for attempting to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the caf√© could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the danger of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear connections to Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he declared on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars for security in order to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it declarations of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on deposit , under the conditions that he aband@@ ons his austr@@ ali@@ an and Serbian pas@@ sports , reports to the police daily and stops at an exit lock from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident at A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab apart
in case of a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment , as the police told .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ maker tore apart completely .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
there was a loss of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es to send pictures
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of an 11 year @-@ old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when she was asleep , logging into an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a number of un@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping ho@@ gg .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ er@@ ted her mother immediately .
the police took care of this and saw the five pictures , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web searches , which used terms for the search for in@@ decent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg then claimed to the officials that he did it because it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es on the internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preten@@ ding to be a polic@@ eman in order to frigh@@ ten them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be an addiction to frigh@@ ten people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that searches on the computer were carried out by him , but he said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es .
after his talks with the unknown person he was asked who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and crying .
she also saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ant with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused used computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation to speak with girls who looked much younger than he was .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty according to the indictment , having taken un@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year to viol@@ ate the conditions and not to appear before the court for a hearing on 24 March this year .
defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked Ho@@ gg to not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , argu@@ ing that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; could be found in his crime .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict until October to obtain background reports on social work .
Ho@@ gg was given a security deposit in this case but was held in custody because of hear@@ ings to other cases .
he was still admitted to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of judgment .
slu@@ ice switches to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up outside the main control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many locks left the fear of discovery and arrest more often at smaller border cross@@ ings
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
since Tuesday , more than 1000 refugees have been taken up along the river Inn River Inn in the Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn districts .
they were on foot over bridges and traffic ri@@ fl@@ es to the German side .
there they are received by federal police and forwarded to the registration .
according to the German Federal Police Office , more refugees were again arriving at Munich Main Railway Station in comparison to the start of the week .
about 700 people arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 a.m. , a spokes@@ man said in the morning .
after the re @-@ introduction of controls on the Franco @-@ German border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : runner @-@ up of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the southwest
meteor@@ ologists warn against storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low @-@ pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air flows into the country , distributed by the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful low was the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was pulled over the Atlantic over the last few days by the Bermuda Islands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected mainly in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , the Black Forest can also be used in the Black Forest , the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and the Con@@ stance District with bends of 60 to 90 kilometres per hour .
on Friday , the sun can be seen again longer .
the crowd makes it : every two years the car builders at the IA@@ A show their novel@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , there is a lot of movement in the compact cars that are currently selling particularly well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present , cars from the compact class are particularly popular : some 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the Federal Office of Motor Transport ( KBA ) alone in August .
this is also reflected at the IA@@ A ( public stage 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars , many new compact models will be introduced this year .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available to dealers in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive either .
Opel represents a start @-@ up below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf with a view that starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra will cost from 16@@ 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is powered by a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
furthermore , the H@@ esse offers further diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which also three @-@ cylinder petrol engines are among the first to count .
unlike the most important competitors , VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which can also be seen at the International Motor Show ( IA@@ A ) .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IA@@ A ?
Renault m@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ competi@@ tor M√©@@ gan@@ e to the race .
at the fair , the M√©@@ gan@@ e can only be seen as a five @-@ door in a conventional and an under@@ lined sporty GT version .
in the trade he comes early next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan off@@ shoot wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
in doing so , the compact infin@@ iti with its curved lines fits into the design line of the brand .
the basic model will receive a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer also includes a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy of man
the Federal Constitutional Court has given the right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary Institution of Te@@ gel , who lived for months in a small cell .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are accommod@@ ated in too small cells .
this decision was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a resolution published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , the parties may even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
with this , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful : he was placed in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not separated spati@@ ally .
after that , the man who , according to his lawyer &apos;s instructions , has now been on the open foot , has been transferred to a larger cell .
his position of office as a result of the un@@ dig@@ ni@@ fied detention conditions against the Berlin country failed .
but the judges lifted the verdict of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al and re@@ mitted the case to the new trial .
they see man &apos;s dignity viol@@ ated .
the Chamber of Appe@@ al now decides on the amount of compensation
even if , for legal reasons , only a few days of detention for compensation were decisive for compensation , a compensation request was given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear of protecting the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Appe@@ al must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
in the past , the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war .
they only said in April a prisoner claim compensation because he was imprisoned in a cell naked .
according to a decision of 2011 , the multiple occup@@ ancy of a cell without separate toilet is un@@ worthy of man .
in addition , in addition to Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , who had agreed to a det@@ ain@@ ee in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the former pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff was housed in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case over three months a day between 15 and 21 hours a day .
the Berlin pris@@ ons have also hit the head@@ lines in recent weeks due to lack of personnel .
prisoners are therefore always included again and again 23 hours , which increases aggres@@ si@@ veness , even in fights it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Justice Press , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not staff@@ ed because of young people , 19 are to be om@@ itted in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we create the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what comes to Germany ?
according to the German Federal Ministry of Interior , some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year , according to Deputy Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can create that and we create that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming on in Germany gives the following overview .
according to various progn@@ oses between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institut ) apartments each year - for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has ever been built ( 250@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings ) .
the lack of housing is dramatic , but above all with affordable rental properties : every year 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing units fall out of the rental price , and these particularly favorable apartments will also apply for refugees .
for this reason , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from now 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
the P@@ est@@ el Institute &apos;s view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute is far too little . 80 000 social housing units have to be produced each year , and the federal government would have to invest 6.@@ 4 billion euros per year .
scientists and Federal Minister of Agriculture agree that there must also be more tax advantages for housing construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research ( Institute for Employment Research ) , 55 per cent of the poultry in Germany can be employed in the long @-@ term .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be asked systematically for their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation critic@@ ises .
but for the integration of refugees , it is crucial whether they find work in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the reception society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mig@@ ration@@ alist Dietrich Thr@@ √§n@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany , according to the Thr@@ √§n@@ hardt , there has been a political turn : from the prohibition of work for refugees to recognise work .
while there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seekers from up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence requirement , the asylum seekers are limited to a residence .
in society - also because of the shortage of skilled labour - there is a majority of the points of view that refugees should be able to access the labour market sooner .
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is lacking knowledge of German .
so far there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
research also shows that workplaces are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
for this reason , the construction of networks is the K√∂nigs@@ weg path to work integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few fled parents give their children to the kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; it is very important for parents to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ya Ko@@ sten@@ bar , Youth and Family Spo@@ kes@@ person at the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes manuals in different languages .
if the demand for educ@@ ators increased sharply due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would attempt to increase the training capacity - for example by allowing more technical schools .
students without knowledge of German will be prepared for lessons in the countries .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ suit@@ cases from Berlin &apos;s school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk appreci@@ ates that approximately 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no federal state does not prohi@@ bit asylum seekers or tolerated their studies - the only exception to date has been Berlin , Interior Sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his stance .
student @-@ willing refugees could be easier access to the university .
for refugees with a res@@ titu@@ tion or compensation do not receive any benefits according to the asylum application law if they start studying .
the latter generally do not receive a B@@ af@@ √∂@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to b@@ abo@@ li@@ cal persons .
patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for B@@ af@@ √∂@@ g , from January 1 , 2016 , this span will be shortened to 15 months .
however , this financing gap must also be closed , calls for Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the Deutsche Studenten@@ werk .
the students should get B@@ af@@ √∂@@ g straight away .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and religion is an important part of their identity for many .
the state should gradually conc@@ ede to Islam the same rights as the churches have , and the existing state @-@ church right to develop a new state @-@ religion relationship .
the establishment of an Islamic welfare association , which takes care of newcom@@ ers professionally , would also be important .
responsibilities also belong to the rights .
so the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be willing to work with the state in many areas and grant him certain control options .
this also includes the willingness to take preced@@ ence against religious fundament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed the concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to take such conflicts in Germany immediately &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law into Arabic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also need to change the majority society , reducing discrimination and racism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Germany has - as a result of European decisions - an anti @-@ discrimination point and a general equality law since a decade now .
but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U murder series revealed that the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motif .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants and the advoc@@ acy groups of non @-@ white German have long demanded and why international agreements such as anti @-@ racism are committed to Germany must become a reality in the coming years , if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens are to use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the refugees that have previously been expected , according to physicians &apos; president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as Man@@ - Power and capacities are concerned , we do so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money needed to flow into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery advises all newcom@@ ers to termin@@ ate health maps immediately .
services rendered could later be bil@@ led with the federal states .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to break so many people with the limited catalogue of services that the asylum seekers performance law fores@@ ees .
apart from that , the doctors especially make the language barriers possible .
so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are getting worse about their diseases than other patients .
they do not only have to be taken over in hospitals , even in medical practices .
it would be helped many refugees but also with more general medical centres in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic look .
among refugee children , for example , there are clearly more un@@ reported obstruc@@ tions , and with the young people it is about HIV @-@ raising .
with the partially different types of disease , German doctors come from their training , but Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis is not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and concerning the lack of doctors , it may even be allevi@@ ated by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have developed a highly developed educational system , and several refugees are even doctors .
in order to be allowed to practice , however , they must demonstrate their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams once more .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill according to estimates by the Bundes@@ psycho@@ therap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially vulnerable are refugee children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recent study by the Technical University of Munich confirms that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives in trau@@ mati@@ zed Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffers from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , pal@@ pit@@ ations and death @-@ fears .
other symptoms include sleeping and concentration problems , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment is necessary , declared Mun@@ z .
to date , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees have received psycho@@ therapy .
while psych@@ ologically ill asylum seekers can make an application for psycho@@ therapy in the social @-@ offices , the treatment usually lasts several months .
in addition , social workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses would decide whether therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .

Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , the el@@ dest leader of Africa , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across social media .
the opening of the parliament was also disturbed by statements made by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them of accompanying Mr Mu@@ gabe from Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen .
last month , they had ki@@ cked him out and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the Nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones , warned against disturbing Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told journalists about Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the affected parliament members that the immunity in the Parliament ends and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
this year HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and service business activities .
the expected job cuts lead to a burden of over $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , &quot; stated HP in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , President and Chief Executive Officer , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will focus on providing un@@ paralleled , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; explains the company &apos;s statement .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to produce electro @-@ plants and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to cope with the aband@@ on@@ ment of traditional PCs to mobile devices .

FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario implies that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four matches for England , and in view of his history , his participation in the next summer of the European Championship is certainly uncertain .
the big shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the previous season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone which did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also acknow@@ le@@ dges , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player attempts to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of premi@@ er injection Ltd lists 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he played in only 65 of Arsen@@ al &apos;s 15@@ 7 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for Arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a casual time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win fighting power , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves .
Arsen@@ al starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns up a rotation within the team .
H@@ √©@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ √≠n and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning that Ma@@ th@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and give the players who need it to take a short break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has been launched in the last season .
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , where the Richter scale was measured 3,@@ 2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven by the far hope to lead the club to its first European apo@@ calyp@@ se .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it never worked out at Arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Celeb@@ ration : the comedy show , which gave us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the lack of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up has now become even more desperate than ever before , as demonstrated by young men on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the United Kingdom , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to address the issue , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Campa@@ ign against a her@@ edi@@ tary life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it .
friendship is at the heart of the fight to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms stated that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends first , so that friendship may work .
in the age of communication led through social media , with its emphasis on substance on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even though in reality isolation dominates .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy .
the beauty of friends was that this focuss@@ ing was turned up@@ side down .
each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments at football look in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can relate to it , even though they often hold back to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a telephone pastoral worker told me : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and end@@ anger myself really clearly showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness if one talks about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status about the phone will help people in moments of desper@@ ation too , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Celeb@@ ration with the backdrop completely re@@ designed to celebrate the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or even better , if you see someone sitting in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .

with Real Madrid and Sha@@ k@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , as they do not only seek the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter@@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a classic example of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced by his hom@@ etown team and against the club with whom he started his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League , so it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause problems to our opponents , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t scored one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury , which in the weekend could hold a 2 : 2 tie in his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Mary in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ inian wing storm was described as the man who took PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he suggested why when he passed into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ i &apos;s pass behind Malm@@ √∂ &apos;s defense before he passed by Johan Wil@@ and into the long corner of the network .
but if anyone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ √∂ , who hit Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , played with nine national players on the field and was armed with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field , a heavy opponent .
but apart from a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos; posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave himself up , with some bad passes and bad degrees , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was in the first half in no less than five attempts and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after re@@ boot .
nevertheless he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who turned Di Mary into a shooting shot by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the pole ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an achieved his sixth round of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ √∂ could return to the game , and only an excellent way to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before replacement players Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi had been recognized at the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the coach of Malm@@ √∂ , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , we have only played in the Swedish League , which does not have the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualifying games are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola from 2008 prevented changing to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club in Qatar since summer 2015
a few years ago , the FC Bayern was shortly before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times Cup winner , four times champion league winner , twice champion league champion , twice European champion , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to the al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now betra@@ ys that he was standing in front of Barcelona before the Euro 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ √ßa would sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won everything at that time , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and also the FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ mel@@ ig@@ ge wanted me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in memory : in the summer of 2008 J√ºrgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern .
guar@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this work today for the German record master : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ √ßa has signed Guardian ola and I played a great European . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s how he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 had run with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians across the entire distance on the lawn , switched the red out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated at the end the King &apos;s Triumph .
matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confronted the African film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on the diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday Night by HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown broke out when this emphas@@ ised the need for alternative perspectives in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the selected script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it with the occupation of the film and not in the lin@@ eup of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with offen@@ ded un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian captiv@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck &apos;s producers and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to encourage people to think about - anyone who will be the director - how they treat the character of the Harmon@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said at first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a nut that is beaten by her white col@@ der .
the producer of Dear White People chose Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for the film directing rights ; Dam@@ on said that her directing &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded with dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip , writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; talking about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO K@@ NO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise racial representation is at the forefront of social discussion in the media .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement exer@@ ted country @-@ wide impact and urged the legislature and the authorities to stop discri@@ min@@ atory practices against color content .
in February the singer Prince made an all@@ usion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album still matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
like books and black life , albums have still their meaning .
in recent times , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published a statement in response to the question of the Fox News Person@@ ality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ les invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or crowns the first champion
professional sports climbing and operating assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete to win the American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which was just completed its 7th season , never experienced a competition participant who was able to finish all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
the climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope was part of the last task in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time with which he was the first athlete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge fully three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero said with E ! news after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned or deserved more than 10,000 $ , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of a sudden ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , didn &apos;t get any prize money .
according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed .
how much money is a wonderful price and the life changes , he gets the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he has a gru@@ dge over it .
he is just so happy to have done what he did .
he received crowds of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be struck by someone , then I &apos;m glad it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt as if they had exchanged roles .
America N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ aks past on Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in the bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand in the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 at Target Field .
the T@@ wins covered a chance to climb within one half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card Square .
for Detroit , although only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so hard to handle over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories make fun no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ extremis@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two Inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) jumped 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and made three R@@ uns possible .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to stop this year severely , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw any game in the bull@@ pen , and so I want to go into the game quite concentrated .
the designated tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ figure hit by Mart@@ ine@@ z ever since he had four hits against the Seattle naval on July 6 .
&quot; he washed the pist@@ ol well , &quot; he said .
he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked much better at the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the back@@ round at the end of the seventh string , the T@@ wins had their best chance to get into play again .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ te , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy ran down the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run from the right @-@ handed drummer Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the finishing run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play .
it was the leading 27th time in this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe struck a Double Play
after Detroit added a Insurance Run at the end of the ninth in@@ ward , Wall managed a R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ h@@ anders , however , st@@ ach S@@ ano on three Pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
Detroit benefited at the start of the game by an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three races in the first two pati@@ os against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been deleted from the injury list before the game had been missing for more than a month because of a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I &apos;ve been wishing for , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt better when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ ushes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z led Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; during the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 winning stre@@ ak with the runners in the sc@@ oring position .
the third bass player Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers placed in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single by Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE for 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he has not beaten very well , but he has caught the right position .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ Count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the Reli@@ able right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four strokes .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the throw @-@ off .
he is studied by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the ank@@ le list because of a shoulder cut , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP has painted Daniel Mor@@ ris from the vulner@@ ability list to fight against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four star@@ ters with the Tig@@ ers since he was purchased in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing on the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will finish their series of three matches at Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4,@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are to be accommod@@ ated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the arriving people will then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the City of Wiesbaden r@@ ushed on Tuesday evening .
she counted 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital had been prepared for this event in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily sign up .
they should then be distributed to other municipalities .

also Frankfurt and Han@@ au have set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe the decisive reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he accused European states of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one had been happy that the ch@@ ali@@ ce had passed by a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends in front of our front door , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase of international aid on the ground for the refugees .
Austria controls at the southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria has re @-@ established controls on its southern and eastern borders .
Austrian Federal Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening in Austrian television station ORF , no one will be sent back to Hungary .
even Germany did not send back refugees to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , that &apos;s so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement that Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there have already been negotiations between the General Director for Public Safety and Repres@@ ent@@ atives of Germany .
she did not call her concrete figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , together with several other EU heads of state and government , asked for a special summit next week .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on a common action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers plan to take a new approach to the binding distribution of more than 120@@ ,000 refugees at a special meeting next Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
in view of the strong refugee flow in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial and distribution of people .
the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , announced Merkel on the late Tuesday evening after almost four hour consultations with the Prime Ministers at the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined that those people who need protection deserve this too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but those who do not have a pen@@ al perspective cannot remain in Germany either .
this view was dealt with strongly in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck in the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometer long border to Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later , the government announced in Budapest that the border with Romania could be shut down with a fence .
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent tu@@ g@@ boats crossing Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports in Turkey , thousands of other migrants lost their way to the Greek border .

under the ice sponsor of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus a global ocean sw@@ app@@ ies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes researchers from observations of the space probe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to this , the moon is easily deceived by its orbit around the Ring Plan@@ ets .
this motion of motion is only small , but still too large for a permanently fixed body of the sky , it is stated in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) from Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the journal &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
it was known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had already discovered iron vul@@ can@@ es at the south pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds , sp@@ itting water vap@@ our and ice cream and thus feeding the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ ring of Saturn &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed at that time .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear .

man@@ goes are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but whoever wants to pay attention to his slender line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ goes contain relatively high sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
nevertheless , the exotic fruits are healthy : they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ur@@ sor beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits are therefore able to support vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying man@@ goes , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ gos can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste of course pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go , however , also gives sav@@ our@@ y dishes a special note .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .
the US package service U@@ PS brings up to 9@@ 5,000 temporary aid for the Christmas business in the USA .
the company has already started recruitment of seasonal workers , and U@@ PS announced on Tuesday .
most of all drivers are looking for .
already last year , U@@ PS increased its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 hil@@ locks .
in view of the bo@@ oming online business U@@ PS and his rival F@@ ed@@ Ex have been making arrangements to be prepared for Christmas business since last year .
in 2013 , delayed deliveries had made the package mer@@ its harsh criticism .
first blow @-@ storm , then striking cold front
in the coming night , in the valleys of the alpine side of the F@@ √∂hn wind through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz announced on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night for Thursday the hair dryer partly blows through the fo@@ eh@@ le valleys .
after F@@ √∂hn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a distinctive cold front , which brings heavy rainf@@ alls , gu@@ sts and a temperature decline .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a communication , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a strong south@@ western current .
on the side of the Alp@@ ine@@ fjord , on the night of Wednesday the fo@@ eh@@ n breaks through the valleys .
as a result , the F@@ √∂hn blows to Thursday morning in the footh@@ ills with arches of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the F@@ √∂hn winds its way into the adjacent centre and on the mountains even hurri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my F@@ √∂hn winds from 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity starts to st@@ ow on the slope of the Alps .
here , rain stops , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total south of the Alps , in the next 48 hours , some more than 100 liters of rain per square meter must be accounted for , this after a large amount of rain has already fallen in the last few days .
on Thursday morning the blow dryer is blowing , and the result is a cold front with strong , partially weather@@ ed rain from west to east via Switzerland .
together with the cold front the wind refresh@@ es strongly until stor@@ my , and the temperatures go well back .
the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , whereas in the south , on the weekend it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther place
nearly 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz in Rome .
in the presence of Mayor Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino , a previously nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former .
in Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , he is now known as the &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome , next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the work group of the Protestant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , rec@@ alled on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could often only live their faith in the city of Pop@@ es for centuries .
with the place I become visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith is welcomed in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) spent a few months in Rome as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k for the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 .
he felt the town back then as an ann@@ ot@@ ated sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
his negative impressions may have encouraged him by historians in his later fight against Rome .
Luther then initiated the split of the Oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his theses on the decline in the decline .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) crown of thorns is one of the major works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his bi@@ ble .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated biblical texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which is now published with splendid pictures .
in the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his completely personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 subjects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary , it can be quite glo@@ omy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for about three years Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project for which he made a subjective and artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are cycles that focus on topics such as cross paths , pla@@ gues , commandments or fa@@ therhood .
with this he spontaneously fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther publishing house with its the@@ ological focus as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its emphasis on art books .
and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the relevant scrip@@ tures on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into the present , into the current context . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible @-@ quote by Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
this way , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old gives twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family belonging to the strict protest@@ ant ruler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was education already with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt recalls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work on that , in order to be able to bear me again with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to revi@@ ve art in a fast @-@ pac@@ ed manner : &quot; today , the perception of pic@@ torial worlds is shaped by advertising , and it is loud .
symbol@@ ism is displaced .
artists have a different desire and joy to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt would like the viewer to &quot; fall &quot; into the images , let them work , discover and sense the power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; always &quot; to have been a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
I did not take care not to fully grasp the Bible , but also selected the most important , mysterious subjects for him .
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; this is about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot;
for Hans M@@ √∂h@@ ler from Luther &apos;s publishing house this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ √∂h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
part of the origin@@ als - paper and linen pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on November 15 in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
construction commen@@ cement for BM@@ X railway draws near
plans made , place found , company commissioned , Erd@@ h√º@@ gel model@@ ed for a round course : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was already finished .

so hill de@@ ported , new place searched - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
the approval was received in October , the first joint @-@ party Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will be even more visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further commem@@ oration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensified engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees by 2019 and the Bundes@@ liga is a clear sign on the weekend .
the football re@@ acts to the sharpen@@ ing situation in Germany and sec@@ ures policy its help in tac@@ kling the upcoming problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must interest each individual to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B chief Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the Chanc@@ ellery next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mrs. √ñ@@ zo@@ ƒü@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will certainly play a central role in this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and will help .
but the crucial course must be the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we have ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; explained Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the ver@@ ge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some federal li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already this weekend , the 36 professional associations set a clear sign if they will bear the print &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sports director Ru@@ di V√∂l@@ ler from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a matter of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes on everyone , nobody can see it away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use football clubs , no , we have to use our bla@@ sting force , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent character of the league . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the national team of women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Quali@@ fication Game against Hungary this Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a big collective work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 lic@@ en@@ sees had started their own projects in their loc@@ alities was great .
just as great is that small and small clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and the next year , the association , together with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government , will provide 300@@ ,000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already rec@@ alled the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : head of the SAP executive officer loses an eye in case of accident
according to several reports , the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software corporation , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye through a crash in early July .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the accident on the staircase in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he fell to a glass of water after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he &apos;s almost bleeding , fain@@ ted , then dra@@ gged out into the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can do his job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully operational &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S√ºd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , said the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can do something like this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s important to stand up again when you &apos;ve fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen apart from skir@@ mish ...

soccer : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus vs. Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : wick@@ er f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback by Marco R@@ eus have defini@@ tively sm@@ ashed in the first group game of the Europa League .
the national player will also be absent from the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in Du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19 : 00 PM / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot rely on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether R@@ eus will be back in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ Game against Le@@ verk@@ usen on Sunday , the B@@ V@@ B Coach admitted : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
due to the high load of its pros , Tu@@ k@@ le will not only change its stem cells on the R@@ eus position .
he announced a change to the goal keeper &apos;s position .
for this reason , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes up the place of Chief Musi@@ cian Roman b√ºr@@ ki .
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion .
although Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller will be used in all European league games in the future , he left the door open .
with a high probability , he will also contest the second game .
the for@@ ging statement by Mit@@ ch@@ ord R@@ eus that the final one for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , sees mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl for comprehensible : &quot; that &apos;s why Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants leadership in Germany
according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany will be a technological leader in the change of the car .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the International Motor Show ( IA@@ A ) of a &quot; new mobility era . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries that come together with representatives of industry at the International Motor Show ( IA@@ A ) .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid rise in digital radio communications .
a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria is currently being developed for testing new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not impose additional liability risks &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government wishes to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use internationally to raise the permitted maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
the Federal Government also wants to advocate a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only envis@@ aged man as a driver .
in automated driving , increasingly the car takes the lead , the driver gets more and more to the passenger .
the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds .
according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economics , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways will be technically possible by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should not be expected until 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the German site is estimated by the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD Vice @-@ President S@@ √∂ren Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability for accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the Germans are still looking skep@@ tical - much more than Fren@@ ch@@ men or Americans .
a survey conducted on Wednesday by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the test organisation Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect 31 percent to believe in it at all .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents account for up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , in the United States 33 percent .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to fully rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey by Digital Union Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey across all roads .
at least 15 percent could imagine on the motorway , in traffic jams 45 percent .
well , every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .
Bol@@ l says team and double start at table tennis EM
according to the present stand , the D√ºsseldorf @-@ based company will only open its doors on September 25 to October 4 .
the final decision should be made at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys learned it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to clin@@ ch the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said German coach J√∂rg Ro@@ √ü@@ kopf during the European apprenticeship in D√ºsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time Bol@@ l was on the flight to a long @-@ term scheduled sponsor@@ ship meeting in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo is the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Single European Champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ kl@@ ist in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also rec@@ alled the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; Timo also was missing at that time , and we became European champion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what we should ori@@ ent ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the World Ranking for World Ranking . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and thus that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t say today that I am the En@@ f@@ ant terrible of Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was very easy in the past , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from September 18th at the Kunsth@@ alle des Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer changed his first negative attitude to a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For me , an exhibition sounded a bit of death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously taken place in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the art gallery , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into this hardly visible work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed complete artwork , for which much effort was practi@@ sed : to fr@@ at@@ ze the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was specifically hired .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , 14 tons of material brought the makers to Munich .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special treat : a leder@@ h@@ osen @-@ outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Our Lady .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gau@@ l@@ liers &apos; old ted@@ dy bear can also be seen in the exhibition .
it stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashionable attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he wasn &apos;t a good student and bad in football ) he dressed his ted@@ dy bear and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
his parents couldn &apos;t have allowed him to play with a doll .
he then taught himself to disc@@ ard fashion himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
for his first fashion show he did not have to pay the models .
they got nothing , but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of sheer curtain - P@@ lau@@ en tip as fashion ni@@ ches
in the past , the long embroi@@ dery machine in and around P@@ lau@@ en was about to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and spi@@ kes were created in large quantities for customers , who used them for example on ceilings and she@@ ers .
this alone doesn &apos;t work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ thers P@@ lau@@ en .
instead fashion is important again .
in the early days of the P@@ lau@@ en tip , fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , for accessories such as bags and for regional costumes .
at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans against past styles , is an increasing order potential .
those who do not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already make half of all orders .
Mo@@ hren@@ itz P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the branch association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery , together with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
in the last 15 years , about 80 percent of sales have been broken away .
private specialty shops and wholes@@ al@@ ers are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
nowadays , the mass commodity is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and is distributed almost exclusively via chains .
exports are also weaker , current to Russia and the US .
there are enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association tries to score points also through environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains about the embroi@@ dery in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year , we have been leading a seal of quality , which shows that we produce environmentally and socially compatible products . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schne@@ e@@ berg branch of the University of Applied Arts in Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - special@@ ising in embroi@@ dery and lace .
in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , one has to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies that need to think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historic snow@@ ball point .
in doing so , the machine bu@@ cks small spheres in some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ en gold@@ smith master@@ in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ √üe took inspiration from it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , I could not do anything with traditional P@@ lau@@ en tip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in an elaborate procedure , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of pure lace - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reu@@ ter says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also delivers to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and the surrounding area and want to have a souvenir .
with this I see my jewellery as modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ en tip .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
legends can &apos;t be touched , but Disney still dar@@ es to take a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
however , according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; it is not about a new movie , but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes 20 years after the first movie with the magic pa@@ wn ma@@ ids .
it &apos;s about the experiences of the N@@ anny family with the B@@ anks Family in times of the Great Depression in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins for more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .

XI ur@@ ges to open the economy more broad@@ ly for the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy has to open wider to the outside in order to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping stated on Tuesday of a group t@@ asked with steering the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should strive to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Leadership Group for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
advancing new start @-@ ups and driving forward reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , Xi declared .
the management board has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list to control market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system .
after the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment .
the system is tested gradually and improved by test programs .
the initiative is of great importance as it plays a major role in the allocation of resources to the market , guarantees a right @-@ wing business environment and makes the market more open , said the statement .
the government will also lo@@ osen up controls over the powers transferred to the company and make sure companies decide how to manage their businesses .
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas will be opened for private investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right of attor@@ neys to guarantee their activity and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors was also discussed at a meeting .
Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated in the meeting as announced in a declaration published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit value in predat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and to give consumers a much higher dose of the tox@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , who has received an appropriate working paper from the EU , sharply critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full force to pregnant women and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish , should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
large predat@@ ory fish are already so strongly polluted with mercury today that , on the basis of the still existing limit values , about 50 percent of catches are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be uns@@ al@@ able .
in return for this loos@@ ening , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to ag@@ grav@@ ate the limit values of other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because smaller cem@@ et@@ fish such as car@@ p are usually so low that they already comply with the planned maximum values . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dy distra@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolfgang sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal which is highly toxic to humans , which is highly enriched by the food chain mainly in predat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government therefore warns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small amounts of previously un@@ born damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its website with regard to the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is mainly caused by coal burning into the environment .
according to written information from the German Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power stations reach more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount em@@ itted in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish , for instance in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube , was &quot; long @-@ lasting and widespread , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had cited in March from the paper .
in the past year Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish have already been among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
