&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures to be used in the implementation of the provisions of Part I concerning securing measures .
the aim of the safety measures laid down in this Convention is the timely discovery of the diver@@ gence of significant volumes of nuclear weapons of peaceful nuclear activities for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons for unknown purposes as well as the deter@@ rence from such a branch through the risk of early discovery .
to obtain the objective stipul@@ ated in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , combined with spatial interference and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical conclusion of the follow @-@ up by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which material quantity , which is not proven for a certain period of time , is specified for a certain period of time under specification of the accuracy limits for the specified me@@ gen .
in carrying out its inspections , the organization according to Article 3 makes full use of the security system of the community .
the accounting and control system of the community for core material according to this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
in the application of its safegu@@ arding measures , the community will make use of the methods and measures of the following kind and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are determined and useful in the supplementary agreements :
a ) a measuring system for determining the quantities of preserved , manufactured , lost , lost or otherwise removed from the stock removed from the stock and the volumes ;
B ) assessing the reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
( C ) procedures for determining , evaluating and evaluating differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ;
( e ) Proced@@ ures for assessing the accumulation of non @-@ measured inventory and non @-@ measured losses ;
F ) a log and reporting system which exhibits the core material inventory and changes of this inventory , including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone for each material balance zone ;
( g ) Pre@@ precau@@ tions to ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ure for reporting reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures according to this Convention are not limited to material in mining or ore processing .
B ) Ur@@ an - or th@@ orium @-@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described in the letter c ) enters the States , the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , provided it is not established for specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaving nuclear material , which is suitable for the composition and purity for the production of fuel or the is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or process phase in which it is produced , or is introduced into the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , it is subject to the other hed@@ ging measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be concluded on the basis of the requirements specified in Article 11 . if the conditions specified in Article 11 are not fulfilled , however , the Community considers that the recovery of nuclear material , which is subject to this Convention , is temporarily un@@ available or desirable from resi@@ dues , the organisation and the community refer to each other concerning the application of suitable securing measures .
B ) The securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organisation and the community unanim@@ ously assert that this core material is practically non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able .
at the request of the community the organization liber@@ ates the following basic material from the securing measures according to this Convention :
a ) special fis@@ sile material , if it is used in grams or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) Nuclear material , if used in non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 which is above 80 % .
at the request of the community the organization liber@@ ates nuclear material , which would otherwise be subject to securing measures under this Convention , from these safegu@@ arding measures , provided the total material quantity freed from this Article in the states at no time is more than
a ) a total of one kilogra@@ m of special p@@ alle@@ able material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment that lies below 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above that of Natur@@ ur@@ an , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the fi@@ v@@ ef@@ old square of accumulation ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) 20 metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
should the delivered core material be processed , processed or stored together with core material , which is subject to the safegu@@ arding measures under this Convention , precau@@ tions for the re @-@ use of the securing measures are made on that material .
the community meets with the organization of supplementary agreements , which are to the extent necessary for the successful and effective establishment of the tasks of the organisation under this Convention , in detail as to how the procedures set forth in the Convention are applicable .
the supplementary agreements can be extended or changed without alter@@ ing this Convention in agreement between the organization and the community .
the organization , the community and the states undertake all efforts so that these agreements may enter into force within nin@@ ety days of the entry into force ; an extension of this period will require the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
on the basis of the initial report mentioned in article 62 , the organisation presents a summ@@ arized inventory of the total material underlying in Article 62 , regardless of its origin , and carries out this inventory of inventory based on the subsequent reports and results of its follow @-@ up reviews .
between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , the Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other
the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is hin@@ dered by general resources problems .
C ) It is the objective of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to ensure that this goal is reached .
D ) The E@@ EC and the organisation have consul@@ ted one another about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central links in order to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
for this purpose , the organization of the E@@ EC has presented a table from which it is intended , in which way it intends to apply the criteria set out in this Agreement ;
the organisation arran@@ ges a special account under the name &quot; special transaction &quot; which consists of the funds that the Member States contribute to the special transaction bank in accordance with this Agreement ; this account is managed and used by the Organization as &quot; ste@@ ward &quot; ) , only to the purpose specified in this Agreement , and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement .
the special transaction account is managed separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest bonds issued by the Member State , which are to be paid on demand in the currency of the State in the Order of the Organization as an administrator of the special transaction and to be deposited at the deposit of the organization in the country concerned .
B ) The payment shall be made in two install@@ ments , and i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement or to any other between the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker agreed upon ;
II ) the second in the amount of the residual value of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at a different time , which was agreed between the E@@ EC and the administrator , taking into account the deadlines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) E@@ ach Member State can make payments before the above dates upon request .
in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , the administrator takes approximately proportional draws to the cash or the school @-@ j@@ ails to cover the expenses for the special loans and to balance the special transaction account in an appropriate manner .
when granting these loans , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the E@@ EC :
the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
( VI ) the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further bor@@ rowing capacity on loan terms and conditions ; and
VII ) the extent in which the problems of the affected countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
each special transaction system serves to finance a clearly defined and rapidly exp@@ and@@ able development programme or project ( including a sec@@ toral submission ) , regardless of whether it is part of the organisation &apos;s loan programme or not , according to the procedures and practices financed by the organization &apos;s proper funds , to be considered , approved and administered , taking into account the pre@@ am@@ ble &apos;s objective of this agreement .
the funds of the special transaction must not be used instead of the legal means of the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( bank ) or the organisation which is bound by a loan or credit for a program or project , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of entry into force .
apart from section 4 , special loans are subject to the same payment terms which are generally applicable to the development loan granted by the organization ; they are thus re@@ payable in 10 years each in 50 years .
special loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts for payment of this watch are to be paid directly to the organization that it reserves .
each transaction loan must be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the source of the means is given .
the income from each special transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the bene@@ fici@@ ary or for goods or services produced or rendered ( i ) in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries which are members of the organization and which may be the car@@ et@@ aker at the time of loan granted , recipients of a special transaction loan .
capital re@@ payments of special transaction loans are made on the special transaction account , and the amount paid back in the currency of a Member State shall be transferred from the car@@ et@@ aker to the Member State as soon as possible .
the administrator has informed the E@@ EC for the complete awar@@ ding of all the special transaction loans to the E@@ EC , which is approved by the directors in preparation and about the plans and programmes approved by the directors .
during the period of re@@ payment of the special offers , the administrator has informed the E@@ EC four times a year on the development of the special loans and the expenses paid for this .
the car@@ et@@ aker sends the E@@ EC as soon as possible after conclusion of the financial year of the organisation a detailed account statement of the special transaction bank with an opinion of the external audi@@ tor of the organisation for this account closure .
after full payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the E@@ EC transfers as soon as possible a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account .
the administrator creates and performs appropriate records and accounts , from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts paid to the account and the amounts paid to the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States are visible .
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrator until the full issue of the special transaction counter from time to time have an exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction bank , the progress of programs or projects financed by special action plans and over any other questions concerning the provisions of this Agreement .
if this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , which the E@@ EC and the Organization may agree , the agreements and all the resulting obligations of the parties are invalid with immediate effect .
if the total amount of the total amount claimed by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement is rep@@ aid and transferred to the Member States , this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are terminated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States regard the Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities the conclusion of the procedures concerned .
the Sec@@ retariat shall forward these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the regular approval of this agreement by the E@@ EC to the Organization .
this agreement becomes effective and occurs in force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the named noti@@ fications in the organization .
this agreement is written in two documents in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , whereby each wor@@ ding is equally binding .
whereas the agreement in the form of a letter exchange for amendment of the App@@ endi@@ x A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is to be concluded , H@@ AT has issued the following VER@@ RO@@ PO@@ LA@@ TION :

I honor to confirm you the receipt of your present letter with the following wor@@ ding :
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm the approval of your government to the foreg@@ o@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobil@@ isation of the recei@@ v@@ ables of the Member States within the framework of the medium @-@ term financial contribution
the BI@@ S could close stand@@ by credit cards with central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks make a corresponding application .
the agreement could be concluded by the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor , within a total amount of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion accounting units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future funding funds of the member countries .
however , some conditions are already mentioned below for which the BI@@ S would be ready .
with each Stand@@ by loan , the BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als , without a total of five years .
at the opening of the loans as well as with their event@@ ual extension , the BI@@ S would charge a credit opening .
in addition , the first draw would not be concluded before the end of one month following the conclusion of the Stand@@ by Agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the drawing would take place in the currencies available at the BI@@ S , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that would be dealt with taking into account the funds of the bank , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those applied by the BI@@ S at the respective time on under similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to the market rates .
however , if the BI@@ S must obtain the required resources on the market itself , then the interest rate coming to the application could reach a maximum , which corresponds to the Li@@ bor rate raised by a corresponding margin .

I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to set provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb - and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the joint market organisation for sheep and goat meat by the community .
- fresh or cooled h@@ amm@@ el - lamb - and goat &apos;s meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples containing the an@@ tigen , which is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or another substance stated on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured twice in a suitable medium by dil@@ uting the re@@ agent to be examined .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the strongest power di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated solely by the volume of the blood cell in@@ undation in the total volume .
for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has defined international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for the determination of the blood group @-@ determination International norms , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are elabor@@ ated at the time norms .
according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination of most specific@@ ity is expressed as an ag@@ glut@@ ination sti@@ cker which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation .
the ti@@ ters show the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the final mixture within a series where a micro@@ scopic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of the re@@ agents for blood group determination , available for the International standard preparations ( currently Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown agent in international units ( See Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B s@@ me@@ ar according to definition 256 international units per ml .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory of Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of a comparable ti@@ tr@@ ation of the International Anti @-@ A ( S ) standard and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2@@ B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its properties should be retained for at least one year .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date of a re@@ agent in a fluid form according to the label is at most one year after the last satisfactory effectiveness test .
the exp@@ iry date on the label for dry re@@ agents depends on the results of the feasibility trials ; it is approved by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is so closed that no moisture can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 % of its weight if it is tested by further drying via phosphor@@ us pent@@ oxi@@ des at a pressure of no more than 0,@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours .
in order to prevent bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvent supplied by dry re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent continues to fulfill the requirements for specific@@ ity and efficacy with the added substance .
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein nitrogen per ml fluid or re@@ dissolved serum .
the re@@ agents , whether in fluid form or after re@@ activation , must be transparent and must contain neither sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents for the international exchange of blood group determination should not be colored arti@@ ficially as far as possible , at least until an international agreement has come about through a unified system .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities , that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity located in a tank must be so large that the content may be used to perform the effectiveness tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all production stages and checks of the re@@ agents for blood group determination .
appropriate samples of all re@@ agents that have been completed must be stored in the laboratory for a long time , until it can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
the re@@ agents used for the determination of the blood group may contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective portion , the others are the necessary aids for strengthening the effectiveness and preservation of the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective part in three groups .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin are exclusively substances of human origin , or that animal or plant re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin .
on each individual container a black on white printed label is available in English and French , which contains the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the quantity or , in the case of dried re@@ agents , quantity and composition of the liquid needed for re@@ plen@@ ishment ,
in addition , this label or label on the box in which the individual containers are placed or the instructions attached to the containers contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,

based on the Joint Declaration adopted by the ministers of the EF@@ TA countries and the Member States of the Community as well as by the Commission of the European Communities on 9 April 1984 in Luxembourg , which includes a call to create a European Economic Area , particularly with regard to the simpli@@ fication of the border form@@ alities and the country of origin ,
in DER Er@@ wa@@ vering that the Community has decided within the Action Program to strengthen the Single Market , to introduce a unified management paper on January 1 , 1988 , in the internal trade of goods .
in THE weighing that it is appropriate to simplify the goods transport between the Community and EF@@ TA countries as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries , in particular by the introduction of a single management document ,
in THE reason that this agreement shall not be interpreted as binding , that it un@@ le@@ ashes the contractual parties from their obligations under other international agreements .
in this Convention , measures are set to simplify the goods traffic between the Community and EF@@ TA countries , as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries ; for this purpose , a unified management document ( herein@@ after referred to as Poli@@ cies &quot; ) shall be used in particular for all export and import procedures as well as for a common shipment procedure ( herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Delivery Proced@@ ures &quot; ) .
the form@@ alities associated with the goods traffic between the contracting parties are gro@@ unded by a paper to use for the pattern according to the patterns in An@@ nex I to this Convention .
the paper serves as a registration or paper for export , dispatch or import .
- expressly requested for the implementation of legislation applicable in a contracting party whose application would not be guaranteed with the sole use of the paper ;
- demanded by the parties , so that they may apply to the enjoyment of a portion or a certain relief .
( 1 ) This Convention prohi@@ bits the Parties not to apply simplified procedures , even in the use of data processing , with regard to further facil@@ itation for the parties involved .
( 2 ) simplified procedures can , in particular , stipul@@ ate that the goods concerned are not subject to a customs office and the registration for these goods shall not be submitted to the customs office ; furthermore , the submission of an incomplete application may be approved .
in such cases , a registration in which the competent authorities may be subject to a periodi@@ c en@@ roll@@ ment , must be submitted within the deadline established by these authorities .
in the cases of paragraph 1 may be permitted instead of using a paper &apos;s paper receipt paper .
if the paper is used , the involved parties can contribute with the consent of the competent authorities to the fulfillment of all the form@@ alities associated with ex@@ port@@ ation and import instead of the revision leaves in the trade @-@ standard lists in which the goods are described .
- to conclude agreements or agreements with respect to a further simpli@@ fication of the for@@ esters for their entire goods traffic or for sub @-@ areas ;
- for shipments which include several types of goods , to verify the for@@ esters in the shipment process charging lists instead of the supplementary sheets for a paper ;
- allowing noti@@ fications to be created if necessary , without pre @-@ print , by public or private data processing facilities in accordance with the conditions set by the relevant authorities ;
- permit the competent authorities to request the data required for the provision of the relevant cases in their data processing systems for the treatment of the registr@@ ations , and , if necessary , without giving a written registration ;
- permit that the competent authorities in the event of using a data processing system for the treatment of the applications fores@@ ee that the export , shipment or import notification is made either by the inclusion paper created by this system or , if such paper is not created , by entering the data into the data processing system ;
- to use the facil@@ itation adopted by the Com@@ miss@@ al Committee in the way of a decision pursuant to Article 11 ( 3 ) .

( 2 ) The use of paragraph 1 may not be linked to a special condition of the competent authorities .
however , without prejudi@@ ce to the special provisions on collection programmes , the competent authorities can fores@@ ee that the form@@ alities for export and the shipment process are printed on one and the same pre@@ text by means of the copies provided for these for@@ esters .
in the cases of Article 7 , the competent authorities shall be convinced , as far as possible , that the information contained in the copies of the application in the individual proceedings is consistent .
( 1 ) In order to ensure a smooth flow of goods between the contracting parties and to facilitate the disclosure of ir@@ regul@@ arities or violations , the customs authorities of these countries shall ask one another on request or - if they consider it of interest to another contracting party - from all available information ( including administrative reports )
( 2 ) The administrative assistance may be partially or partially denied or denied , if the requested land of view is that the administrative assistance would imp@@ air its security , public order ( &quot; or@@ dre public &quot; ) or other essential interests or viol@@ ate business , business or professional sec@@ rec@@ y .
( 3 ) For ref@@ using or rej@@ ecting the administrative assistance , the appropriate decision and its justification shall be notified to the requ@@ esting country .
( 4 ) If the customs authority of a country is seeking assistance , which it cannot afford , if it is sought , it indicates in its request for this circum@@ stance .
