<seg id="696">The aim of the safety measures laid down in this Convention is the timely discovery of the divergence of significant volumes of nuclear weapons of peaceful nuclear activities for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons for unknown purposes as well as the deterrence from such a branch through the risk of early discovery.</seg>
<seg id="697">To obtain the objective stipulated in Article 28, material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance, combined with spatial interference and observation as important supplementary measures.</seg>
<seg id="698">The technical conclusion of the follow-up by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which material quantity, which is not proven for a certain period of time, is specified for a certain period of time under specification of the accuracy limits for the specified megen.</seg>
<seg id="699">In carrying out its inspections, the organization according to Article 3 makes full use of the security system of the community.</seg>
<seg id="700">The accounting and control system of the community for core material according to this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones.</seg>
<seg id="701">In the application of its safeguarding measures, the community will make use of the methods and measures of the following kind and, as far as necessary, foresee how they are determined and useful in the supplementary agreements:</seg>

<seg id="710">B) Uran - or thorium-containing material, which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described in the letter c) enters the States, the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material, provided it is not established for specifically non-nuclear purposes;</seg>
<seg id="711">C) leaving nuclear material, which is suitable for the composition and purity for the production of fuel or the isotope enrichment, the plant or process phase in which it is produced, or is introduced into the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle, it is subject to the other hedging measures mentioned in this Convention.</seg>
<seg id="712">A) The securing measures envisaged in this Convention shall be concluded on the basis of the requirements specified in Article 11. if the conditions specified in Article 11 are not fulfilled, however, the Community considers that the recovery of nuclear material, which is subject to this Convention, is temporarily unavailable or desirable from residues, the organisation and the community refer to each other concerning the application of suitable securing measures.</seg>
<seg id="713">B) The securing measures envisaged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13, provided that the organisation and the community unanimously assert that this core material is practically non-recoverable.</seg>
<seg id="714">At the request of the community the organization liberates the following basic material from the securing measures according to this Convention:</seg>
<seg id="715">A) special fissile material, if it is used in grams or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments;</seg>
<seg id="716">B) Nuclear material, if used in non-nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13, if such core material is recoverable, and</seg>
<seg id="717">C) Plutonium with an isotope concentration of plutonium-238 which is above 80%.</seg>
<seg id="718">At the request of the community the organization liberates nuclear material, which would otherwise be subject to securing measures under this Convention, from these safeguarding measures, provided the total material quantity freed from this Article in the states at no time is more than</seg>
<seg id="719">A) a total of one kilogram of special palleable material, which can consist of one or more of the following materials:</seg>
<seg id="720">II) uranium with enrichment of 0.2 (20%) and above, calculates by multiplication of its weight with enrichment,</seg>
<seg id="721">III) Uran with an enrichment that lies below 0,2 (20%) and above that of Natururan, calculates by multiplication of its weight with the fivefold square of accumulation;</seg>
<seg id="722">B) a total of ten metric tons of natural uranium and depleted uranium with enrichment of more than 0.005 (0.5%);</seg>
<seg id="723">C) 20 metric tons of depleted uranium with enrichment of 0.005 (0.5%) or below;</seg>
<seg id="724">Should the delivered core material be processed, processed or stored together with core material, which is subject to the safeguarding measures under this Convention, precautions for the re-use of the securing measures are made on that material.</seg>
<seg id="725">The community meets with the organization of supplementary agreements, which are to the extent necessary for the successful and effective establishment of the tasks of the organisation under this Convention, in detail as to how the procedures set forth in the Convention are applicable.</seg>
<seg id="726">The supplementary agreements can be extended or changed without altering this Convention in agreement between the organization and the community.</seg>
<seg id="727">The organization, the community and the states undertake all efforts so that these agreements may enter into force within ninety days of the entry into force; an extension of this period will require the agreement between the organization, the community and the states.</seg>
<seg id="728">On the basis of the initial report mentioned in article 62, the organisation presents a summarized inventory of the total material underlying in Article 62, regardless of its origin, and carries out this inventory of inventory based on the subsequent reports and results of its follow-up reviews.</seg>
<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States Belgium, Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation (Organisation) on the other</seg>
<seg id="730">The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income, whose development is hindered by general resources problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) It is the objective of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its utmost to ensure that this goal is reached.</seg>
<seg id="732">D) The EEC and the organisation have consulted one another about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central links in order to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">For this purpose, the organization of the EEC has presented a table from which it is intended, in which way it intends to apply the criteria set out in this Agreement;</seg>
<seg id="734">The organisation arranges a special account under the name "special transaction" which consists of the funds that the Member States contribute to the special transaction bank in accordance with this Agreement; this account is managed and used by the Organization as "steward"), only to the purpose specified in this Agreement, and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The special transaction account is managed separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions are to be paid as follows: a) The payment is made in the form of cash or non-interest bonds issued by the Member State, which are to be paid on demand in the currency of the State in the Order of the Organization as an administrator of the special transaction and to be deposited at the deposit of the organization in the country concerned.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) The payment shall be made in two installments, and i) the first in the amount of at least 45 v. h. the contribution within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement or to any other between the EEC and the caretaker agreed upon;</seg>
<seg id="738">II) the second in the amount of the residual value of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at a different time, which was agreed between the EEC and the administrator, taking into account the deadlines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans.</seg>
<seg id="739">C) Each Member State can make payments before the above dates upon request.</seg>
<seg id="740">In accordance with the usual procedures of the organization, the administrator takes approximately proportional draws to the cash or the school-jails to cover the expenses for the special loans and to balance the special transaction account in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">When granting these loans, the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">The extent to which international economic factors contributed to the country's current and foreseeable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">(VI) the composition and tendency of the country's debt service and its further borrowing capacity on loan terms and conditions; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) the extent in which the problems of the affected countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Each special transaction system serves to finance a clearly defined and rapidly expandable development programme or project (including a sectoral submission), regardless of whether it is part of the organisation's loan programme or not, according to the procedures and practices financed by the organization's proper funds, to be considered, approved and administered, taking into account the preamble's objective of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="746">The funds of the special transaction must not be used instead of the legal means of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (bank) or the organisation which is bound by a loan or credit for a program or project, which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of entry into force.</seg>
<seg id="747">Apart from section 4, special loans are subject to the same payment terms which are generally applicable to the development loan granted by the organization; they are thus repayable in 10 years each in 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="748">Special loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies.</seg>
<seg id="749">Amounts for payment of this watch are to be paid directly to the organization that it reserves.</seg>
<seg id="750">Each transaction loan must be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator, in which the source of the means is given.</seg>
<seg id="751">The income from each special transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the beneficiary or for goods or services produced or rendered (i) in a Member State; ii) in developing countries which are members of the organization and which may be the caretaker at the time of loan granted, recipients of a special transaction loan.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments of special transaction loans are made on the special transaction account, and the amount paid back in the currency of a Member State shall be transferred from the caretaker to the Member State as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="753">The administrator has informed the EEC for the complete awarding of all the special transaction loans to the EEC, which is approved by the directors in preparation and about the plans and programmes approved by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the period of repayment of the special offers, the administrator has informed the EEC four times a year on the development of the special loans and the expenses paid for this.</seg>
<seg id="755">The caretaker sends the EEC as soon as possible after conclusion of the financial year of the organisation a detailed account statement of the special transaction bank with an opinion of the external auditor of the organisation for this account closure.</seg>
<seg id="756">After full payment of the special transaction loan, the administrator of the EEC transfers as soon as possible a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account.</seg>
<seg id="757">The administrator creates and performs appropriate records and accounts, from which the contributions to the special transaction account, the amounts paid to the account and the amounts paid to the account and the repayments to the Member States are visible.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the caretaker work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">To this end, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the administrator until the full issue of the special transaction counter from time to time have an exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction bank, the progress of programs or projects financed by special action plans and over any other questions concerning the provisions of this Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="760">If this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date, which the EEC and the Organization may agree, the agreements and all the resulting obligations of the parties are invalid with immediate effect.</seg>
<seg id="761">If the total amount of the total amount claimed by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement is repaid and transferred to the Member States, this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are terminated with immediate effect.</seg>
