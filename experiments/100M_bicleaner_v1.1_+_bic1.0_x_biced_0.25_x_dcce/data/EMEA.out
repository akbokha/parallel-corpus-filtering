the present document is a summary of the European Public Health Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
if you need more information about your disease or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as a 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg of melting tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. Th@@ rough thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( listening or seeing things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and del@@ usion ; • Bi@@ polar I distur@@ b@@ ance , a mental illness , in which patients have multiple episodes ( periods of anor@@ ex@@ ic high @-@ tuning ) alternate with periods of normal mood .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the drug in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick monitoring of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ b@@ ance if the oral consumption of the medicine is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be used for inser@@ ting or the melting tablets in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , which are broken down as well as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this im@@ pairs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of the neur@@ ons amongst themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole probably acts as a &quot; partial agonist &quot; for recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser extent than the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , works to activate the recept@@ ors .
as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing its recur@@ rence .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy to prevent the recur@@ rence of symptoms has been studied in three studies over a period of up to one year .
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases that suffer from increased un@@ rest over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence in 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed using Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study to 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased un@@ rest , compared with Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in the symptoms of the patients was examined by means of a standard dial for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responding to the treatment .
the company also conducted studies to examine how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution to intake it .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly stronger reduction in the symptoms of increased anxiety than the patients receiving placebo .
in four of the five short @-@ term studies , Abi@@ li@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies .
Abi@@ li@@ fy also prevented the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously untreated patients for up to 74 weeks and when administered in addition to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses also reduced more effectively than placebo to increase the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy for taking ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( un@@ controlled stain@@ ing ) , thor@@ ac@@ ic ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , headache , blur@@ red vision , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , drow@@ sin@@ ess ( increased sali@@ va production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in patients with predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes related to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole prevail over the risks .
in addition , the Committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , when oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd. for the transfer of Abi@@ li@@ fy to the entire European Union .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes related to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
an increased efficacy of dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not demonstrated , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , independent of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
in consideration of the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ duc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l dosage should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the onset or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that there was no increased risk of su@@ ici@@ dal risk in patients with bi@@ polar disorder compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease , con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , over@@ flow problems ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ dispose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ ter@@ ated and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
if signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia are observed in a patient treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy , it should be considered to reduce the dose or to cancel the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate m@@ ns , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be removed .
this is why ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be applied with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with aria pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients treated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole underwent an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
however , there was in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents including Abi@@ li@@ fy .
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents who permit direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with respect to a deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar deficiency due to combination ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effects or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is advisable when ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l is used in combination with alcohol or other central potent medications with super@@ imposed side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the resor@@ ption rate of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dos@@ ages should be undertaken .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ dable metabol@@ ites .
if one considers the joint gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks to the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects , and similar dos@@ ages should be undertaken .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ or , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be increased to the dose height before the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 common with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be calculated with a moderate increase in ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine @-@ R@@ atio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan to be pregnant during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
this drug may not be used during pregnancy due to insufficient data security for humans and due to the concerns associated with animal reproductive studies , unless the potential benefits clearly justify the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned about dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ el pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them .
the following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasional ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study of over 52 weeks in patients treated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurred compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy .
in a controlled study for 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ treatment .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients treated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treated patients .
in the long @-@ term follow @-@ up period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment was 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely monitored laboratory parameters showed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
CP@@ K increases ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
the side effects associated with anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and their occurrence in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate acute over@@ doses with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death .
although there is no information on the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dosing , since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma protein binding .
it is thought that the efficacy of ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and to the hi@@ stam@@ ine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11@@ C @-@ ra@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D@@ 2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , on the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the Put@@ amen .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a half @-@ operated study , 52 percent of respon@@ der patients who adher@@ ed to the study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales , defined as secondary education goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ h @-@ depression @-@ scale , showed a significantly stronger recovery than with Hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a significantly higher decline of the rel@@ apse rate , which was 34 % in the ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l group and at 57 % in placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study for schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg ) compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg ) .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dose over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ el pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in two placebo and actively controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a efficacy in week 3 versus placebo , which was comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also showed a comparable share of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of man@@ ia like lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which partially touched on lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabili@@ zation period prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ el showed himself superior to placebo with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar set@@ back , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ apse into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xi@@ de of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ isation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean elimination terminal time is approximately 75 hours for ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole with extensive metast@@ ases over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 14@@ 6 hours with &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , nor showed gender @-@ dependent effects in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients .
a policy @-@ specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic did not indicate clin@@ ically significant differences in respect to the eth@@ ni@@ city or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydr@@ ot@@ ro@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with different cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the elimination of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not enough to draw conclusions to their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated doses , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , so they have limited or no significance for clinical use .
the effects comprised a dose @-@ dependent sub@@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the middle ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in the bile duct of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , concentrations found in the human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of the sulph@@ ate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ - ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the bile duct , and are well below the limit values ( 6 % ) in in vitro sol@@ ubil@@ ity .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 @-@ times the mid @-@ steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

it is thought that the efficacy of ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study for schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg ) compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg ) .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ el pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study comparing the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole as a solution to take 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in tablet form in healthy volunteers , the ratio between the geometric C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .

Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution is used for quick check of det@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with episodes of bi@@ polar disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l injection solution should be terminated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in order to increase the resor@@ ption and to minim@@ ise vari@@ ability , an injection is recommended in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the Glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle while circum@@ vent@@ ing adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or ac@@ ut therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
if further oral treatment is indicated with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , see the summary of the features of the medicine to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy &apos;s melting tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution .
there are no studies on the efficacy of ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l injection solutions in patients with as@@ gi@@ bility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders caused by schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure ( see Section 4.5 ) .
studies on the safety and efficacy of ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l injection solution are not available to patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed by prescribed or illegal medicines ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease , con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , over@@ flow problems ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ dispose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ ter@@ ated and malign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifestations of m@@ ns are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating , and heart rhythm disorders ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with respect to a deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to combination ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , where weight gain is known as side effects or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was greater compared to the after @-@ alone administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , in a study , in which healthy volunteers ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( 15 mg dosage ) were used as one @-@ off intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly and the simultaneously Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) were intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly received .
105 The antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , decreases the absorption rate of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .

in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as det@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms of as@@ gi@@ bility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - Reference arm .
the mean improvement from the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score with the primary 2 @-@ hour end point was 5,@@ 8 for Plac@@ ebo , 9,@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe at@@ gi@@ tis , a similar efficacy was observed regarding the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined due to decreased number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a half @-@ operated study , 52 percent of respon@@ der patients who adher@@ ed to the study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales , defined as secondary education goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rate , showed a significantly stronger recovery than with Hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a significantly higher decline of the rel@@ apse rate , which was 34 % in the ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and at 57 % in placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study for schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .

in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who had re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabili@@ zation period prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ el showed himself superior to placebo with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar set@@ back , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ apse into the man@@ ia .
in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % larger the AU@@ C after administration of the same dose as a tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar to the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the average time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was tolerated well by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated application in a systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , respectively , respectively 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly .
studies on the reproductive toxic@@ ity after IV application showed no safety @-@ relevant concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated doses , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans ; this means that they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters of which had previously received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in any application or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
in the main study , 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel .
if only the patients who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the medicines in terms of efficacy indicators such as time to worsen@@ ing of the disease and survival .
in contrast , patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel .
it may also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before treatment begins .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel and that in contrast to other drugs containing pac@@ lit@@ axel , it was not necessary to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Abra@@ xis Bio @-@ Science Limited for the marketing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the whole European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not indicated ( see also Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensor@@ ic neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
in sensor@@ ic neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 the treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is achieved to degree 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies were conducted with patients with impaired kidney function and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dosage adjustments in patients with kidney function impair@@ ment ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 because of not sufficient data for harm@@ lessness and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ arti@@ cular formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel , which could significantly other pharmac@@ ological features than other formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a symptom@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ axel again .
in patients no renewed Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ene number is increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count rises again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a kar@@ di@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity associated with Abra@@ x@@ ane has not been proven , cardiac out@@ ages in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if , after the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane is nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rhe@@ a , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating agents .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or at child@@ bearing age who do not have effective contrac@@ eption , except treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel is unavoid@@ able .
women in child@@ bearing age should use Abra@@ x@@ ane a reliable method of contrac@@ eption during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to not bear a child up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised of a sperm reservation before the treatment , because the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very often ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) which can affect the air@@ ti@@ ghtness and the ability to serve machines .
the following are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events reported in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma who were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most noticeable important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( 79 % of patients reported ) and was fast rever@@ sible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :
dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue burning , dry mouth , pain in the g@@ ums , loose stools , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , sor@@ eness in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract :
pain in the chest wall , weakness of muscles , head@@ aches , abdominal pain , muscular sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal muscles , flan@@ k pain , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness , very common :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive in relation to a population of 7@@ 89 patients
as these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events has been established .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is an A@@ timi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules active ingredient that promotes the storage of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ular indi@@ ces and stabili@@ zes mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation results in an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in con@@ veys the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in the course of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel through the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is believed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ umin@@ re@@ zep@@ te and due to the alb@@ um@@ inal Prot@@ eins SP@@ ARC ( re@@ vis@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation occurs in the area of the tumor .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two approved non @-@ affiliated studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III study .
in one study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion of more than 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion of 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi@@ center trial was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received pac@@ lit@@ axel in patients with pac@@ lit@@ axel every 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with predic@@ tive medi@@ cation ( N = 2@@ 29 ) or in form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a impaired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metastatic lesi@@ ons .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ as@@ ation and 19 % because of metastatic disease and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for overall response rate and time to progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First @-@ Line treatment are outlined below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared with pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 at a time during the treatment .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy for waste on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of the overall pac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
exposure to active ingredients ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml an@@ alog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 Accor@@ ding to IV dose of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration declined in a multi@@ phase manner .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates far @-@ reaching extra@@ vascular distribution and / or soft tissue connection of pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in a study involving patients with advanced solid tumours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ axel were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with values following a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel .
pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher ( 43 % ) following the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration ( 43 % ) compared with a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , pac@@ lit@@ axel is primarily met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ xy@@ lit@@ axel and two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ di@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
following a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ ic elimination of the un@@ changed active ingredient was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ xy@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , indicating a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al Clear@@ ance .
however , only a few data are available for patients aged over 75 years since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and protected from light light over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ carcin@@ ogen@@ ic medicine and , like other potentially toxic substances , should be treated with caution when handling Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe , over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution is inj@@ ected into a Abra@@ x@@ ane gas bottle .
after complete en@@ core of the solution , the water bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solid .
then the water bottle should be swi@@ v@@ elled and / or inver@@ ted for at least 2 minutes and / or inver@@ ted until a complete suspension of the powder is made .
if precip@@ itations or sin@@ ks are visible , the water @-@ through bottle must be inver@@ ted sof@@ tly in order to achieve a complete res@@ us@@ pension before application .
the exact dose capacity of the 5 mg / ml suspension is calculated and the corresponding amount of re@@ constituted Abra@@ x@@ ane is inj@@ ected into an empty , sterile PV@@ C@@ - or non @-@ PVC in@@ fusion bag .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; member states must ensure that the holder of the approval for market launch prior to market launch provides healthcare professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmacy with the following information and materials : &quot; &quot; &quot;
• Training Bro@@ ch@@ ure • Sum@@ m@@ ary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging inserts . • With clear picture of the correct application of the product accidental cool@@ ers for transport through the patient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that it is similar to a biological drug approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicines &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in patients with normal blood vessels , in which complications could occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion , if a blood sp@@ ill is not possible before the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml may be expected .
the treatment with dis@@ sec@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is displayed .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood sp@@ ends , Ab@@ ys@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein .
the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his car@@ egi@@ ver , provided that they have received appropriate instructions .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are to be controlled prior to treatment in order to ensure that there is no iron deficiency and iron supplements should be given throughout the treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by ery@@ thropo@@ i@@ etal deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and to reduce the consequences of a loss of blood .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) is introduced which enables it to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
in the course of a major study involving 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems , Ab@@ ys@@ amed was compared with the reference drug .
for all patients participating in this study , E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o was inj@@ ected into a vein at least eight weeks before they were either converted to stre@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator for efficacy was the change in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also submitted the results of a study in which the effects of dis@@ sec@@ amed under the skin were examined with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from kidney problems , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values of patients who were amed for dis@@ sec@@ amed were maintained to the same extent as those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ ys@@ amed is a rise in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ inging mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion .
it may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
stre@@ amed as inj@@ ections under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that no allergic reactions are triggered .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that it was approved in accordance with the European Union regulations that the drug has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that is making U@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages to healthcare professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the medicine .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Medi@@ ce pharmaceuticals P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co . kg for the marketing of Ab@@ se@@ amed throughout the European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion requirements in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multiple my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy , with the risk of trans@@ fusion due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia in the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , for planned larger operative procedures requiring a large volume of blood ( 4 or more blood in women ; 5 or more blood in men ) .
in addition to the reduction of foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery in adults with no iron deficiency , in which high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml may not be applied to an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except for pa@@ edi@@ atric patients , in which the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms of an@@ emia and disease may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition condition is required by the doctor .
an increase in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values over or below the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration can occasionally be observed in one patient .
in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to reach the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value rises by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose which is required for the control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia .
the clinical results suggest that patients with initially low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the clinical results suggest that patients with initially low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in incre@@ ments of at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms of an@@ emia and follow @-@ up may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition condition is required by the doctor .
in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to reach the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose which is required for the control of the an@@ emia .
if after 4 weeks of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reti@@ cular number of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase is &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the reproduction rate of &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l is increased compared to the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if there is ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) three times a week after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week .
on the other hand , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the binary number of &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l is increased compared to the bas@@ eline value , an attack on epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be abor@@ ted .
patients with mild an@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood cann@@ ul@@ ae is required , should be received twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery .
iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation programme , so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the screening therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg every 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis through the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to flush the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug into circulation .
patients suffering from treatment with any ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive a dis@@ sec@@ amed or another ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see Section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ie ) .
heart attack or stroke within a month before treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) .
the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients suffering from a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery : severe coron@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion , vascular disease of car@@ ic@@ ular or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with a recent cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely has been reported on the occurrence of an anti @-@ body medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of active ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the check hole value should be determined and the usual causes of non @-@ response should be investigated ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminium toxic@@ ation , infections or infections , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) .
if the ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin index , taking into account an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin index ) , is reduced ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers are normal , and if no other cause of loss of action is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row should be considered for the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA .
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ ys@@ amed in patients with a risk for an anti @-@ body @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
in clinical trials , increased mortality risk and risk for severe cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thropo@@ i@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical trials have shown no significant benefit due to the administration of epo@@ e@@ tin , if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased via the concentration required for the control of the an@@ emia and the prevention of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the increase in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hyper@@ tension .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clinical evi@@ d@@ ative coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia associated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
in the case of tumour patients under chemotherapy , a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response should be taken into account ( patients who may need to be trans@@ acted ) .
if the H@@ b increase exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) a month or a h@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) is exceeded , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic events ( see Section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ic an@@ a@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thropo@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the involvement of the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients fores@@ een for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly before beginning of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa treatment .
patients undergoing a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive appropriate thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis proph@@ yla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be ruled out that in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial mac@@ ular value of &gt; 13 g / dl , there is an increased risk of post @-@ operative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events .
in several controlled trials , epo@@ e@@ tin did not prove that they could improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in people with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , if ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration was target from 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l )
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose should be adapted to the rising ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
in @-@ vitro studies on tumor tissues , there is no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F in terms of hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
about thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( cereb@@ ral thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , cereb@@ ral thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , pulmon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , pulmon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , pulmon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , pulmon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , pulmon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , pulmon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , pulmon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , pulmon@@ ary thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , pulmon@@ ary thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , pulmon@@ ary thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , pulmon@@ ary thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , retinal thro@@ mb@@ oses and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients suffering from epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent rise in blood pressure or deterioration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients treated with ery@@ thropo@@ et@@ ines .
regardless of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , surgical patients with cardiovascular disease can result in repeated blood donations to thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , derived from genetic engineering , is gly@@ co@@ si@@ ated with respect to the amino acids and the carbohydr@@ ate content equivalent to the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , isolated from the urine of an@@ a@@ emia patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates the ery@@ thropo@@ i@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .

survival and tumour progression were examined in five major controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin showed consistent , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mortality than in the controls with an@@ a@@ emia due to various common malign@@ ancies .
overall survival in studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and in controls .
there is an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ical events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , because too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa drugs after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a somewhat prolonged half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than serum levels , which are achieved after IV inj@@ ections .
there is no accumulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are given 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
( bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be attributed to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study on hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
14 epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to reduced f@@ ö@@ per@@ tal body weight at the recommended weekly dose compared to the 20@@ x of the weekly dose recommended for humans , resulting in a retard@@ ation of the os@@ si@@ fication and an increase in fet@@ al mortality .

during the treatment with A@@ se@@ amed , there can be a slight dose @-@ dependent rise in the number of blood cells within the normal range , which is reflected back in further treatment .
your doctor may perform regular blood tests if necessary to regularly control the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
lack of iron , red blood cells ( ha@@ mol@@ y@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be considered and treated with dis@@ sec@@ amed before the onset of therapy .
very rare was reported about the occurrence of an anti @-@ body @-@ medi@@ ated ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia after mon@@ ate@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( inj@@ ected ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia , it will break down your therapy with dis@@ sec@@ amed and determine how your an@@ emia is best handled .
therefore , it has to be given off @-@ amed by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated for an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value may be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of dying could be increased .
if you raise or increase potassium , your doctor may consider a dis@@ continuation of the treatment with dis@@ sec@@ amed until the potassium levels are in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion signs by inadequate heart rate , your doctor will make sure your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a given value .
according to the present findings , the treatment of blood poverty with dis@@ sec@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and the desired effect should be considered for the assessment of the effectiveness of dis@@ sec@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood pigment ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your final dose accordingly to minimize the risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis ( thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( adi@@ p@@ ous ) or if in the past occurred thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ( e.g. deep ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis or pulmon@@ ary em@@ bol@@ ism ) .
in case you are a cancer patient , keep in mind that dis@@ sec@@ amed like a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances will have a negative effect on the tumor .
if you have a larger orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , the cause of your an@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly before the treatment begins .
if your values of the red blood pigment ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive A@@ se@@ amed , as there is an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis following surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines / have been taken / used recently , even if they are non @-@ prescription drugs .
when you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( remedies for supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ ys@@ amed , your doctor may also arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means to build the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor may also arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of treatment and make sure that the drug works properly and your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a given value .
as soon as you are well set , you receive regular dose of dis@@ sec@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , distributed to two equally large inj@@ ections .
your doctor may also arrange regular blood tests to check the success of treatment and make sure your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a given value .
depending on how an@@ a@@ emia refers to treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to ensure and ensure that the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a given value , the attending physician will perform regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given at 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of surgery and another 4 days after surgery .

ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following illnesses : • O@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause as well as in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including those who recently suffered from a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture like in the eye . • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 ) before the first in@@ fusion or injection into a muscle before the first in@@ fusion .
the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( agent against inflammation ) shortly after the application of acet@@ one can reduce the symptoms appearing in the three days after the in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ lac@@ cia may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
as the active ingredient in Ac@@ lac@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used for evaluating Ac@@ credi@@ sta .
the first study included nearly 8 000 elderly women with o@@ steopor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with o@@ steopor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently suffered a frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined for a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ credi@@ sta was tested in two studies to 3@@ 57 patients and compared with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator of efficacy was whether the content of the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in the serum ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) returned to normal in the blood or decreased at least 75 % compared to the bas@@ eline .
in the study with older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures was reduced by 70 % in people under Ac@@ lac@@ sta ( excluding other o@@ steopor@@ osis medicines ) over a period of three years compared to the placebo .
the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % compared to all patients under Ac@@ lac@@ sta ( with or without o@@ steopor@@ osis treatment ) .
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of patients under Ac@@ lac@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most ac@@ la@@ sta side effects occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
it may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or any other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with ac@@ la@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion site and o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ one ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ credi@@ sta provides instruction material for physicians who prescri@@ be Ac@@ credi@@ sta for the treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis , as well as a similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited for the transport of Ac@@ credi@@ sta throughout the European Union .

the patient information package is to be provided and the following core messages include : • The packaging side • contra@@ indication in pregnancy and nursing women • Re@@ quired for adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When medical or nursing assistance is to be taken back
treating o@@ steopor@@ osis • in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis and o@@ steopor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ credi@@ sta is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of acet@@ one is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ lac@@ cia should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after a treatment by the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ lac@@ sta a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient calcium intake in patients with Pa@@ get twice daily for at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of acet@@ avi@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ lac@@ tation in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days of the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol may be reduced by administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of acet@@ one .
patients with kidney function impair@@ ment ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ clearing &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ lac@@ sta is not recommended , since limited clinical experience is available for this group of patients .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination in older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and young people Ac@@ lac@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 because data are missing for safety and efficacy .
ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , since only limited clinical experience exists for this patient population .
before the start of the therapy , an existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid deployment of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ lac@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient intake of calcium , corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , to ensure at least 10 days of the administration of acet@@ avi@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene ) should be considered before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment .
there are no data available to patients requiring dental intervention , whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days of administration of ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after using ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of severe adverse events reported by atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased in patients receiving ac@@ la@@ sta ( 1,3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the o@@ steopor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial ) , the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ lac@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1 .
ren@@ al dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid has been associated with ren@@ al function disorders that have been associated with ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
changes in the creation of Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance ( measured per year prior to administration ) and the appearance of kidney failure as well as limited kidney function were in a clinical study for o@@ steopor@@ osis over three years comparable to the placebo group and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after administration was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta versus 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium levels ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were present in 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ credi@@ sta in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ credi@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received supple@@ mental doses of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis study in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures following a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures after a recently suffered hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of acet@@ one ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical trial were reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion site such as redness , swelling and / or pain reported ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
o@@ ste@@ on@@ ect@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw@@ s area , especially in cancer patients , is reported via o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) that have been treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including o@@ ste@@ om@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervention .
7 patients with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose in the jaw area at a patient treated with placebo and a placebo treated with placebo .
in the case of over@@ dosing , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation can be achieved by adding oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 successive years was indicated in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 females between 65 and 89 years ) with either a BM@@ D @-@ T @-@ Score for the fem@@ oral neck ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ omet@@ rical verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures was significantly reduced over a period of three years and the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures after one year ( see table 2 ) .
patients aged 75 and older had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ credi@@ sta showed an unchanged effect over three years , resulting in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ credi@@ sta increased bone density on lum@@ bar spine , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 In@@ cre@@ ases bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.0 % , the fem@@ oral neck by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology In 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ otic patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , bone biop@@ si@@ es were taken out of the pool a year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tra@@ be@@ cul@@ ular bone volume and the preservation of the tra@@ be@@ cul@@ ular bone architecture in comparison to placebo .
bone turnover markers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients during periods of study .
the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Ac@@ lac@@ sta reduced significantly by 30 % after 12 months compared to bas@@ eline and was kept at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
total mort@@ g@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the placebo treated group , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , the Ac@@ lac@@ stic treatment increased BM@@ D on the overall th@@ igh and the fem@@ oral neck compared to placebo treatment .
more than 24 months compared to placebo , the Ac@@ lac@@ sta treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % at the overall level and 4.3 % compared to placebo .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a decrease in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in Ac@@ servi@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( Study C@@ ZO@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once yearly administration of Ac@@ credi@@ sta in comparison to the once weekly administration of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was not inferior to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to bas@@ eline .
clinical efficacy of the treatment at the Pa@@ get of the Kno@@ chen Ac@@ lac@@ sta was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically verified , above all mild to moder@@ ately severe disease Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2.@@ 6@@ x to 3.@@ 0@@ fold @-@ specific upper normal value when enrolled in the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily during 2 months was proved in two six months comparative studies .
the combined results showed a similar decrease in pain intensity and effect of pain after 6 months compared to the bas@@ eline for Ac@@ lac@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month study could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 eyes treated with Ac@@ lac@@ sta and 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response was maintained at 141 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate at an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 m@@ g. of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent .
after that , the plasma @-@ key rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a prolonged period of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic disappearance of the large cycle with half @-@ life time t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elim@@ inations phase with a terminal elimination period t ½ γ at 14@@ 6 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the ab@@ ov@@ emen@@ tioned t ½ values ) probably represent the rapid resor@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue .
the total body clearance is 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a dimin@@ ished clearing of met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed substances met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzymes is unlikely , because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible , metabolism @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
specific patient groups ( see Section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min in the 64 examined patients ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and moderate ren@@ al dysfunction down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ clearing up to 35 ml / min no dose adaptation of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
as for severe ren@@ al dysfunction ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- clearing &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are available , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ le@@ thal @-@ acting intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight in rats .
in dogs trials , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C 6@@ x of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) were administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without ren@@ al influence .
sub @-@ chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In trials with intraven@@ ous application the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was determined in rats by dose of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose corresponding to the multiple of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure referring to the AU@@ C , corresponding to the AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated application in accumulated ex@@ positions which adequately exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects in other organs including gastro@@ intestinal tract and liver as well as the intraven@@ ous injection site occurred .
the most common finding in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the metaph@@ or of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all the dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
rats observed ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity at doses of 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such a skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was im@@ printed at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of low serum calcium levels .

Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a substance class that is called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate and is used to treat o@@ steopor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , o@@ steopor@@ osis in men and the disease Pa@@ get of the bone .
declining blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens , which are made from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
the bone reconstruction is quickly done with the Pa@@ get Mor@@ bus , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ la@@ sta acts by re @-@ norm@@ alizing bone reconstruction , ensuring a normal bone formation and gives strength to the bone again .
if you are undergoing dental treatment or undergoing dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with ac@@ la@@ sta .
when using Ac@@ credi@@ sta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you take / use other medicines or have been taken / used recently , even if they are non @-@ prescription drugs .
for your doctor it is particularly important to know whether you take medicines that are known to damage the kidneys .
when using Ac@@ credi@@ sta together with food and drink , please be aware that , according to your doctor &apos;s instructions , you should drink plenty of fluids before and after the treatment with ac@@ la@@ sta .
o@@ steopor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion into a vein .
if you have recently broken your hips , it is recommended to admini@@ ster Ac@@ credi@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg , administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion into a vein .
as Ac@@ la@@ sta is working for a long time , you may need a further dose only after one year or more .
it is important to follow these instructions precisely so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after in@@ fusion .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ lac@@ sta can work for more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment .
if the administration of Ac@@ credi@@ sta was missed , please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before end of the treatment with Ac@@ credi@@ sta If you are considering the completion of the treatment with Ac@@ credi@@ sta , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss this with your doctor .
side effects in connection with the first in@@ fusion often occur ( in more than 30 % of the patients ) , but are less frequent after the subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches occur within the first three days of the administration of acet@@ one .
currently , it is unclear whether Ac@@ lac@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms in yourself after you have received ac@@ la@@ sta .

please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects will affect you considerably or you notice any side effects not listed in this use information .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions until the application ; normally 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .
patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture recommend that the in@@ fusion of acet@@ one two or more weeks after the operative treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of acet@@ one , patients need to be sufficiently supplied with fluids ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
due to the rapid deployment of the effect of ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of acet@@ one .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient intake of calcium , according to at least twice daily 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , to ensure at least 10 days after the administration of acet@@ one .
patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture recommend an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D before the in@@ fusion of acet@@ one .

in addition , four studies were carried out in more than 7 000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive agent to adjust the smoking compared to placebo .
on the other hand , the studies on setting smoking did not show a uniform result , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia on this application was difficult to assess .
which risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? it The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia which were noted during the studies ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were nausea and infections of the upper respiratory tissues .
it may also not be used in patients suffering from an existing severe depression or treated with anti @-@ depres@@ s@@ ants , since it can strengthen the risk of depression and , among other things , cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts among others in a small minority of patients .

it contributes to diet and exercise to treat obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which additionally have one or more risk factors , such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 because of lack of data for efficacy and safety .
depres@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported at up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts of up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the benefit of the treatment in the individual case out@@ weighs the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
it is also possible for patients who - apart from obesity - have no recognis@@ able risks , may cause depres@@ sive reactions .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the general public This document is a summary of the European Public Health Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( in particular overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medication ) is not indicated .
it can be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( in particular overweight patients ) who cannot be satisfied with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic res@@ ins or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin can be maintained with the start of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be better utilized and blood sugar levels are reduced , making type 2 diabetes better .
in more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy was studied ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos has led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which makes it possible to reduce blood sugar levels by 15 mg , 30 mg , and 45 mg doses .
at the end of the Tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of an additional administration with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic resin in lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values was 0.@@ 94 % while the additional dose of placebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and Insul@@ in was studied in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients receiving Ac@@ tos additionally increased H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in the patients who additionally took placebo .
the most common adverse events associated with Ac@@ tos were vision disorders , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ aes@@ thesia ( reduced sensitivity to irrit@@ ation ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one level - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients with met@@ form@@ in as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in .
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for the marketing of Ac@@ tos throughout the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and in which met@@ form@@ in is un@@ suitable due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) .
no data is available for the use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under the age of 18 , so the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are endangered by the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular outcome study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years of age with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced advanced mac@@ ular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in the incidence of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , which , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with elevated output liver enzyme values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal range ) or with other indications of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T levels are increased to 3 @-@ times the limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that point to h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , upper stomach trouble , ti@@ redness , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme values can be checked .
the decision on whether to continue treatment of the patient with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be guided by clinical assessment until the laboratory parameters are found .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain was detected , which can be obtained from fatty deposits and in some cases linked to fluid retention .
as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution a minor reduction in the mean ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and ha@@ em@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred in the treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 3.6 @-@ 4.1 % ) and to a lesser extent in patients under sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic res@@ ins and insulin ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral dou@@ ble@@ - or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or as a dual combination therapy with insulin have the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market launch , a reduction in visual acuity was reported in the treatment of thi@@ az@@ oli@@ an indi@@ ces including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a occurrence or worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescri@@ bing doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients report about disturbances of vision ; a suitable ophthal@@ mic diagnosis should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence amounted to 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years for women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1,@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or she enters , the treatment is to be rejected ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies on the interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , such as oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that , under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ insul@@ ine emia resulting in pregnancy decreases and increases the availability of metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth .
very frequently &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , single cases : unknown ( not estim@@ able from existing data ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and the refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic agents .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one AL@@ T @-@ asc@@ ents showed the three times the upper limit of the normal range , however less frequently than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic resin .
in an outcome study in patients with advanced Mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease , the frequency of severe heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than placebo , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one res@@ ides .
since its launch , it has rarely been reported about cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , but more frequently when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure .
a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated in the groups treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with comparative medications .
in the Pro@@ Active study over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures were treated at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.2 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , compared with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
when taking the daily dose of 120 mg / day for four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days , no symptoms appeared .
pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one appears to be activated via activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator @-@ activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) , which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral blood glucose level in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide as mon@@ otherapy was continued for two years to study the time until the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8,0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time of two years after the onset of therapy , blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient in spite of three months of optimization with insulin was random@@ ized to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients suffering from pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin ; reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ents showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ents compared to bas@@ eline values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was examined in a small , 18 @-@ week investigation of type 2 diabetes patients .
in most clinical trials compared to placebo we observed a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol and slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly elevated levels of LD@@ L cholesterol .
in clinical studies over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the total plasma @-@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared with placebo , met@@ form@@ in or g@@ lic@@ la@@ cide , and increased HD@@ L cholesterol .
in comparison to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas Met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide reduced values .
in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , both on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular disease study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced advanced mak@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ized in groups who received either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to already existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular disease .
after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is resor@@ bed quickly , whereby the peak concentrations of un@@ modified Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one are normally achieved 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV corresponds to the thre@@ ef@@ old of the efficacy of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , it was demonstrated that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not have a relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or decreases the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see Section 4.5 ) .
after application of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the rot ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma elimination period of un@@ modified Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active metabol@@ ite is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with limited kidney function than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of oral Clear@@ ance of the mother substance are similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies mice , rats , dogs and monkeys coinci@@ ded with repeated administration of plasma volume growth with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and rever@@ sible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that , under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ insul@@ ine emia resulting in the gest@@ ation decreases and increases the availability of metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) of the bladder epi@@ th@@ elia have been induced .
in an animal model of family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ an indi@@ ces resulted in increased incidence of color@@ ect@@ al tum@@ ors .

in another study over two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or g@@ lic@@ la@@ cide were examined .
in clinical trials over 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ents showed in Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to bas@@ eline values .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , which has an effect on Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ yp@@ sis synthesis .
although the study showed the objective of its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute coron@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , coron@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization and re@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that with the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one no cardiovascular long @-@ time risks are connected .

Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane has been studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane has led to a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c level , indicating that blood sugar levels have been reduced similarly to other human insulin levels .
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human endo@@ cr@@ ine ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other ingredients .
in addition , the doses of acet@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the package insert ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of acet@@ ph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes were out@@ weighed against the risks .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the transport of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane throughout the European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are normally used once or twice daily if a rapid initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly , for example by intensified insulin therapy , can perceive hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change in strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA opposite insulin @-@ animal origin ) may cause a change in the dosage .
if a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary in the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia are less pronounced or different from previous insulin .
before travelling across several time zones , the patient should be advised to pick up the advice of his physician , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions during therapy and always ask his patients for other medicines taken by them .
4 B@@ oth hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which may occur in a not sufficiently controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fruit death in uter@@ o .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can lead to un@@ consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and ending with temporary or permanent disorders of the brain function and even death .
disorders of the nervous system Occ@@ a@@ sion@@ ary - Periph@@ eral Neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with discomfort , which are referred to as acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are normally rever@@ sible .

hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can , however , gradually develop : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can be treated by the oral supply of glucose and sug@@ ary foods .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juices . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) through a proven help person or given by glucose , which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration of action is up to 24 hours .
resor@@ ption The absorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resor@@ ption .
a number of spheres of cle@@ av@@ age ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split is active .
based on conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated doses , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data can no longer identify any particular dangers to humans .

the present document is a summary of the European Public Health Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
the medicinal potent ingredient in Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) is produced using the method of the so @-@ called re@@ combin@@ ant technology :

Ac@@ tro@@ p@@ id should not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of acet@@ yl may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the marketing of Ac@@ tro@@ p@@ id in the entire European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of rapidly acting insulin must first be re@@ ared , and then the amount of long acting insulin .
3 If a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tro@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary in the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling across several time zones , the patient should be advised to pick up the advice of his physician , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
5 General diseases and complaints at the location of the site - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions at the injection site Dur@@ ing insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( red@@ dening , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma can occur at the injection site ) .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juices . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) through a proven help person or given by glucose , which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients who underwent major surgical procedures has shown that an associated Ac@@ tro@@ p@@ id induced nor@@ mo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar 4,4 - 6.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) reduced the mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total duration of action is about 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( between 6 and 12 years ) and adol@@ escent ( age between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data is limited but suggests that pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .
in@@ fusion systems with ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in concentrations 0.@@ 05 I.@@ E. / ml - 1.0 I.@@ U. / ml insulin humane in the in@@ fusion fluids 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de , 5 % D @-@ glucose and 10 % D@@ - glucose with 40 m@@ mo@@ l / l potassium chlori@@ de are stable at room temperature for 24 hours at room temperature .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients showing signs of de@@ br@@ is , including arthritis ( sor@@ eness and inflammation in the joints ) or lymp@@ h no@@ des ( &quot; stones &quot; that are , larger pri@@ mal deposits that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid level still exceeds 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
there are still cases of g@@ out during the first treatment months , so it is recommended that patients take other medicines at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ o@@ ic .
the drug is not recommended in children and for patients who had an organ transplan@@ t because it was not studied for these groups .
in the first study involving 1,@@ 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the placebo ( placebo ) and allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once a day 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood was below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who took aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of the patients who once daily took 120 mg , with the last three measurements a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of below 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of patients suffering from allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients treated with placebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ o@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
in particular , patients with heart problems in pre@@ history may also have an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ o@@ ic was more effective in lowering ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but could also pose a higher risk of side effects in connection with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to pri@@ mal deposits ( including a known or currently present g@@ out and / or arthritis ) .
if the serum pole acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken into consideration on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
efficacy and safety were not fully investigated in patients with severe kidney function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
children and young people Since there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the application of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients .
transplan@@ t recipients Because there are no experiences in organ transplan@@ t recipients , the application of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure , the treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other har@@ n@@ essing drugs , it can come to an acute attack during the treatment process , because the lowering of the serum resin saw can be used to mobil@@ ise ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissue .
B. with malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ Syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases rises so far that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease Dur@@ ing the phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of the liver function values were observed in patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before the beginning of the F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ e- treatment and in the subsequent course ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine Z@@ ones did not conduct interactions studies with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O @-@ in@@ hibition could lead to a rise in the@@ ophy@@ ll lens ( an in@@ hibition of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine metabolism was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
the simultaneous addition of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 times a day was associated with an increase in the F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ sta@@ sis exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / War@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without requiring a dosage adjustment for the f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient .
in a study involving subjects , 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily showed an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acid containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , delayed the absorption of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( approx . 1 hour ) and causes a decrease in C@@ MA@@ X by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C .
pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies can not be concluded with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at side effects on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal studies do not allow for direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see paragraph 5.3 ) .
patients should be cau@@ tious when driving a vehicle , serving machines or when performing dangerous activities until they can reasonably be sure that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .

the risk factors that were determined in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects , which could occur in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which were reported more than once in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups , are listed below .
diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated at the same time with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical trials no serious rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .

the active mechanism of ur@@ ic acid is the end product of the pur@@ ine metabolism in humans and arises in the context of the reaction cor@@ k@@ ade hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a potent , non @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for in vitro @-@ hibition , which is below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range .
clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each trial the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly ser@@ um@@ aric acid levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine value at the beginning of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily and AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with normal doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the usual dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the lowering of the serum resin intake to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and sustained throughout the entire treatment .
in 50@@ 9 patients , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol received 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl kept 100 mg 1 x daily .
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with ren@@ al function restriction ( i.e. ) .
AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was the primary efficacy end@@ point of 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage reg@@ ression of serum resin concentration in subjects , regardless of kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl of E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum resin concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl ( bas@@ eline ) at the beginning of the study .
the data from the open renewal study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of serum levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so less than 3 % of patients needed 16 @-@ 24 to treat g@@ out ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients did not need treatment for a g@@ out ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the number of g@@ out no@@ des , which resulted in 54 % of patients having complete disappearance of the g@@ out notes up to 24 months .
increased T@@ SH@@ IP values ( &gt; 5.5 μ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and in patients receiving Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased dose after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose @-@ proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , a rise in the AU@@ C is observed for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is larger than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ X amounts to approx . 2.8 @-@ 3,@@ 2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 mc@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease in serum resin concentration , provided this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ranges from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma penetration of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ s showed that these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are mainly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ u@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ labeled F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose in the urine was found in the urine ( 3 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ c@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 30 % ) , its well known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair was found in the chair as un@@ changing F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ite and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ MA@@ x of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function .
the mean overall AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by about 1.8 times of 7.5 μ g / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ g / ml in the group with severe kidney function .

these findings are seen as a result of specific pur@@ ine met@@ abo@@ lization and urine composition and considered not relevant to clinical use .
it has been noted that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on the fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
at high doses , which were about 4 @-@ times the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred , accompanied by a reduction in the re@@ aring performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease in which bones become br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause when there is a risk of a low vitamin D mirror .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient must not lie down until the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
as al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already being used separately in medicines that are approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with o@@ steopor@@ osis in order to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding increasing vitamin D levels .
after a 15 week treatment the proportion of patients with low levels of vitamin D was lower ( 11 % ) in the patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) compared to those who received only al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the Company also submitted data suggest@@ ing that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose required to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) of o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia ( swal@@ lowing stomach ) as well as aci@@ dic stum@@ ps .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other ingredients .
it may not be used for es@@ op@@ hag@@ us disorders , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or for patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or taking of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow these guidelines carefully to reduce the risk for es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is to be swal@@ lowed with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • Pati@@ ents should not lie before the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract , except for p@@ yl@@ or@@ opla@@ sty , can be given only with special caution ( see Section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al lines , were reported in patients taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( partly these were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be pointed out that when symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ corneal pain or new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn the medicine shall be stopped and medical consultation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be elevated in patients who are not taking the medicine correctly and / or taking it after the appearance of symptoms that point to an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was detected , ga@@ stri@@ c and du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a were rare ( after the market launch ) , some of which were severe and associated with complications ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
o@@ ste@@ on@@ ect@@ sis of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including o@@ ste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy region contains mainly intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
there are no data available that indicate whether bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ ase treatment is reduced in patients who need a ortho@@ don@@ tic surgery to reduce the risk of o@@ ste@@ o nec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw .
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the treatment planning in every patient on the basis of an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that when taking a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , they should take the tablet next morning after notic@@ ing their failure .
you should not take two tablets on the same day , but take the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the scheduled day of the week .
other diseases affecting mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated adequately prior to the AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE therapy .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can affect the resor@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if taken at the same time .
patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or breast @-@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly damaging effects with regard to the pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
o@@ ste@@ on@@ ect@@ sis of the jaw was reported in patients suffering from bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most of the reports stem from cancer patients , but it has also been reported in o@@ steopor@@ osis studies .
however , taking the serum Cal@@ cium at &lt; 8.@@ 0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate In@@ sequence of an oral over@@ dose can occur in hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract , such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .

in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the Ascen@@ sions of the BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to maintain ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ oral neck and the entire body was maintained .
fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled studies , in which al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and subsequently 10 mg daily for either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily administration of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new ed@@ dy frac@@ ture by 47 % ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 7.@@ 9 % versus placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .

in o@@ steopor@@ osis , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy subjects , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day over five days ) did not lead to clin@@ ically significant change in oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies in rats have shown that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is distributed temporarily in soft tissue after IV administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly disper@@ sed into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine .

adv@@ agra@@ f is administered to adult patients whom a kidney or liver has been transplan@@ ted to prevent rejection of the transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
since tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Progra@@ f / Progra@@ ms are already being used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously conducted studies with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ ms and data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , with the use of adv@@ agra@@ ph compared to Progra@@ f / Progra@@ ms or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rep@@ elled after a treatment period of one year ( for example , by examining how often a new organ transplan@@ t or a recovery of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , more studies on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation were conducted and examined , as adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body in comparison to Progra@@ f / Progra@@ f .

in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity to tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other components , adv@@ agra@@ f may not be applied .
patients and doctors must be cau@@ tious when others ( especially some herbal ) drugs should be taken at the same time with adv@@ agra@@ ph , as the drug dosage or the dose of the simultaneously taken drug may need to be adjusted accordingly .

only physicians who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this drug or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us this may lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects including under@@ - or over@@ immune suppression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes in the formulation or the regime should be performed only under close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed control of a physician experienced in transplan@@ tation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of switching to an alternative formulation , therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains intact .
the dosage of Adv@@ ant@@ ages should primarily be based on clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in the individual case and on blood levels ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
after switching from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ ant@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ low levels should be checked before the change@@ over and over two weeks after conversion .
in day 4 , the systemic exposure measured as a valley mirror , with both wor@@ dings in both ni@@ eper and liver transplan@@ ted patients was comparable .
careful and repeated checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ low levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ ant@@ al to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ transplan@@ t phase .
since tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low clear@@ ances , an adjustment of the drug can last several days until the steady state is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition in the first postoperative phase does not allow any oral dosage of medicines , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be in@@ stituted intraven@@ ously ( Progra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the creation of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of the application To supp@@ ress the transplan@@ t rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dosage recommendations - K@@ id@@ ney Transplan@@ tation Proph@@ yla@@ xis of Gra@@ ft rejection The oral adv@@ agra@@ ph therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily dose in the morning .
further dosage adjustments can later be necessary as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of the patient &apos;s stabil@@ isation after the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral adv@@ agra@@ ph therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily dose in the morning .
dosage recommendation - conversion from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ ant@@ f M@@ ust a gra@@ ft recipient of twice daily dosage of Progra@@ f Cap@@ sul@@ es should be converted to a once daily intake of Adv@@ ant@@ ages , so this conversion has to take place in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) in relation to the entire daily dose .
ren@@ al and liver transplan@@ tation After switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va to adv@@ agra@@ ph once a day , the treatment with the recommended oral initial dose for proph@@ yla@@ xis of the gra@@ ft rejection must begin .
heart transplan@@ tation With adult patients converted to adv@@ agra@@ ph , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken once a day .
other transplan@@ t recipients , although there is no clinical experience with adv@@ agra@@ ph in lung , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ ts , was included in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in p@@ ank@@ re@@ @-@ transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and with intestinal transplan@@ t recipients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adjustments in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function . in patients with severe liver function disorders , a reduction of the dose may be required in patients with severe liver function disorders .
patients with reduced kidney function Since the ren@@ al function has no influence on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that dosage adjustment is not necessary .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular assessment of serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine levels , a calculation of the cre@@ atine in@@ ine and monitoring urine volume ) is recommended .
conversion from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ant@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us based therapy , caution is advised ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
dosage recommendations in full blood The dose should primarily be based on clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases involving thorou@@ gh@@ bred Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ low controls .
it is recommended to carry out frequent checks of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ level mirrors of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after conversion from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ ant@@ ation , Dos@@ ing adaptation , Chan@@ ges in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or at the same time using substances that could alter the &apos; Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us &apos; full blood concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) .
as Adv@@ ant@@ f is a drug with a low clearance , adjustments of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has occurred .
the data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the level of blood from tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the first time after liver transplan@@ tation is usually in the range between 5 - 20 ng / ml and kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t receivers , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used .
this has resulted in serious adverse events including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects which may occur in a row of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes in the formulation or the regime should be performed only under close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed control of a physician experienced in transplan@@ tation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be refrac@@ tory to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ ant@@ f are not yet available .
proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and transplan@@ t recipients in childhood does not include any clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation adv@@ agra@@ ph .
for possible interactions which may lead to a lowering of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mia levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the use of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may be avoided or other plant remedies should be avoided during treatment with Adv@@ ant@@ ages ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels in the blood is provided , as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels may be subject to considerable variations in such circumstances .
in rare cases an intra@@ ocular or sep@@ tic hyper@@ tro@@ phy designated as cardi@@ omy@@ opathy was observed , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ ant@@ al .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical faults are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma .
like other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the potential risk of malign@@ ant skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of suns@@ creen with a high protection factor .
if patients taking Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , altered states of consciousness , cra@@ mps and visual disturbances , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g . )
as Adv@@ ant@@ f hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded , lac@@ tose , are present in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and , consequently , increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
it is therefore advisable to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - blood level with the simultaneous addition of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose for maintaining the same concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinctive interaction has been achieved with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabol@@ isation .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other drugs tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can interfere with their metabolism .
since tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can reduce the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormone levels , decisions on contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures must be particularly cau@@ tious .
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us may potentially reduce the Clear@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients have no indication that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course of the pregnancy and the outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born on potential adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) is recommended .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :

infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases , such as other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive drugs , are often increased in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , proto@@ zo@@ al ) .
cases of N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy , including therapy with adv@@ agra@@ ph .
it was reported about ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors in combination with the treatment with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
due to its high molecular weight , its low sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ si@@ able .
action mechanisms and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects at molecular level are likely to medi@@ ate the effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ean protein ( F@@ K@@ B@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the nucleus .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ atic in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction units in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ kin genes .
tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , and also the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ c@@ ines ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) and the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

overall , the safety profile of oral programs in these published studies was consistent with observations in large studies in which Progra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients .
an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multi@@ center trial with oral program was reported on 110 patients who received either tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in during a 1 : 1 random@@ isation .
chronic Transplan@@ t rejection , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of ob@@ liter@@ al syndrome , was less common in the first year after transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , in 21.@@ 7 % of cases the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis was reported ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were converted from tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which no acute gra@@ ft rejection came after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis was significantly lower in patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
pancre@@ as @-@ transplan@@ tation A multi@@ center trial with oral program was carried out in 205 patients undergoing a treatment of pancre@@ atic and ren@@ al transplan@@ tation following a random@@ ized trial of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( by protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to reach the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml of 5 .
the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study of oral transplan@@ ts as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive after intestinal transplan@@ ts showed an actual survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one .

factors such as a low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t value and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ bound group of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or a reinforcement of metabolism led by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for higher clearance rates observed following the transplan@@ t .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , leaving ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly via bile .
in case of stable patients , which were changed from Progra@@ f ( twice daily ) to adv@@ agra@@ f ( once daily ) in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) relative to the total daily dose , the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was nearly 10 % lower than under Progra@@ f .
it is recommended to carry out frequent checks of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .
21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be refrac@@ tory to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ ant@@ f are not yet available .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical faults are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma .

adv@@ ant is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a disorder caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II , con@@ genital blood coag@@ ulation disorder ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depend on the use of Adv@@ ant@@ ages for the treatment of bleeding or the prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , causing blood coag@@ ulation problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but produced according to a method known as re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) is introduced which enables it to form the human coag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II .
lawyer is similar to another in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , similar , but is made differently so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the use of the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures .
in the main study , the efficacy of adv@@ ant in the prevention of ble@@ ed@@ ings in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge sep@@ ads has been rated &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ant@@ ages ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against Factor VI@@ II .
Adv@@ ant@@ ages may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human coag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II , Maus@@ - or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a licence to transfer lawyers across the European Union .
dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , according to the location and extent of the bleeding and clinical condition of the patient .
in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events the factor VI@@ II activity should not fall below the specified plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or more until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the danger for the patient is over .
during the treatment process it is recommended to control the dose to be administered and the frequency of inj@@ ections appropriate to the factor VI@@ II @-@ plasma @-@ cross@@ bar .
individual patients can differ in their response to factor VI@@ II , achieve different in vi@@ vo recovery and show different half @-@ value times .
3 . proph@@ yla@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses ranging from 20 to 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight in a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activity is not achieved or if the bleeding with an appropriate dose is not controlled , a test must be carried out to prove an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered .
the dosing speed should be directed after the patient is found , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ coag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II directed by Ig@@ G immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to factor VI@@ II , where the risk within the first 20 exposure days is the greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an am@@ nes@@ tically known inhibit@@ or development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( low ti@@ tr@@ es ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women there are no experiences regarding the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the AD@@ R@@ s , in the largest number of patients , were inhibit@@ ors of factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) which all occurred in previously untreated patients with a higher risk of the formation of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not predictable ) .

the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained during the whole period and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - M@@ irr@@ ors in the plasma as well as the clearing @-@ rate showed sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in 145 children and adults 2 with confirmed heavy to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and prior exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient after 26 ex@@ positions with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E showed a low inhibit@@ or@@ ti@@ ter ( 2,4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
in none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years and a diagnosis of severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) , a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or was established following prior exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) .
in previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical study , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) patients treated with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were inhibit@@ ors of factor VI@@ II .
the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibody ti@@ ter against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant up@@ trend as well as an ongoing peak of the antibody level against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms associated with an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
four patients were spor@@ adi@@ cally reported on the appearance of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophi@@ lic gran@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes in several repeated product ex@@ positions during the study .
7 As for other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E reports about hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ to@@ id reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the activated factor VI@@ II acts as a co @-@ factor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X out of factor X .

based on the data available since the initial authorization , the CH@@ MP still evaluated the benefit @-@ risk assessment as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E &apos;s safety profile , which requires filing of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , so that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years .
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited granted the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) officially that the company will withdraw its application for the transfer of Adv@@ ances to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
usually , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissues that connect , surround and support other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a type of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene in the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ant@@ ine is an &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and therefore cannot cause infections in humans .
adv@@ ex@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the defect found in the human body of p@@ 53 gene , normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and killing the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company presented data from a study with a patient who showed Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Krebs in the area of the under@@ growth , in the bones and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP insp@@ ected the answers of the Company to the questions he asked , there were still some questions un@@ answered .
based on the review of the initial submitted documents , CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120 .
according to CH@@ MP opinion , the injection of adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tumours has advantages for patients .
the Committee also had concerns about the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the medicine .
moreover , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that adv@@ ex@@ in can be established in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the Company did not notice the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate @-@ use &quot; programs with adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modified agent release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective components is released instantly and the other is released slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , inflammation of the nas@@ al channels caused by allergy to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ utter@@ ed .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended , because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy measurements were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms that were reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours into a diary and assessed with a standard scale , how heavy the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all hay fever symptoms except con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients who took Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in the patients who received pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a reduction in the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who took Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ ase ) , stom@@ atitis , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine for treating allergies ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be applied to patients suffering from narrow @-@ angle glaucoma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , ur@@ inary or vascular disease including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ osis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ osis ( cereb@@ ral hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge ) or have a risk of a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the transport of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze throughout the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is to swallow whole ( i.e. without tear@@ ing , breaking or chew@@ ing ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to lack of data concerning the harm@@ lessness and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have gone down .
it is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days , as long @-@ term care may decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time .
after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory passages , treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as a mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within 2 weeks of ending such a therapy .
this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ k@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , erg@@ ot@@ amine , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ic@@ ants , which are per@@ oral or nas@@ al as an ab@@ u@@ sive Rhin@@ ology medication ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , nap@@ ole@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient &apos;s collective and the data is insufficient to give appropriate recommendations for dosage .
the safety and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data do not suff@@ ice to give appropriate recommendations for dosage .
patients must be informed that the treatment should be terminated in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythm disorders , nausea or any other neurological symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a strengthening of head@@ aches ) .
patients with cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck construction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours prior to the performance of der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines can otherwise prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions .
in clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol was administered additionally , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of lost adi@@ n were observed .
the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the patients treated with placebo , regardless of whether it was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
the harm@@ lessness of the application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , however , experience gained from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
as reproduction studies on animals cannot always be transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ ting properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied during pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to a di@@ zz@@ iness which may result in impaired mobility or ability to operate machinery .
symptoms can vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , reduced mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , trem@@ ors , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ ral processes .
headache , anxiety , severe mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , breathing in@@ suffici@@ ency , ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , transp@@ ir@@ ation , nausea , vom@@ iting , preventive pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , blur@@ red vision and hyp@@ ot@@ ony .
CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( dry mouth , pup@@ il @-@ rigi@@ dity and - dil@@ at@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include the inhibit@@ ing of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ s as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the P @-@ sel@@ ect@@ ator on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective pun@@ ctu@@ ality or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dose of 5 mg a day no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess was noted in comparison to placebo .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage may cause other symp@@ athetic effects such as an increase in blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of CN@@ S arous@@ al .
there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , the hi@@ stam@@ ine antagon@@ istic efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n about the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in patient sub@@ groups regarding sex , age or eth@@ ni@@ city .
as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of administration in the plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the body weight of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
within the scope of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were poorly metabol@@ ised .
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ equivalent was to exposure to the gift of an Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated doses , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
the combination lack@@ ed any greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in the oral administration of rats at a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
the pharmac@@ o@@ gil@@ ance system described in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application for authorisation is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating the allergic symptoms by preventing hi@@ stam@@ ine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets allevi@@ ate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose and tear@@ ing or it@@ ching eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating the nose .
under certain circumstances , you may be particularly sensitive to the swelling of the mu@@ cos@@ a pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine which is contained in this medicine .

tell your doctor if you have experienced or diagnosed the following symptoms or diseases using Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • hyper@@ tension • Heart failure , pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythm disorders • nausea and headache or strengthening existing head@@ aches .
if you take Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have it recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs .
air@@ ti@@ ghtness and the use of machines When using in the recommended dosage , it is not to be expected that aer@@ in@@ ol leads to di@@ zz@@ iness or reduces attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you ought to inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
if you forgot the intake of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze If you forgot to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will affect you considerably or you notice any side effects not stated in this use information .
heart ch@@ ase , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , sore throat , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , sugar in urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , ti@@ redness , headache , sleep disorders , nerv@@ ousness and di@@ zz@@ iness .

after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n very rarely has been reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( breath not , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves rash and swelling ) or skin rash .
cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ ase , stomach pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach trouble , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , sleep disorders , muscle pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , over cases of liver inflammation and over cases of eye @-@ catching liver values was also very rare .
it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at for intake ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml mel@@ ts ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml @-@ solution for inser@@ ting .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or respectively .
for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or respectively .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in eight studies involving about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies in seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies of patients who had asthma ) .
the effectiveness has been measured by determining the change in the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the squares , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been submitted to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to inhal@@ e and the melting tablets are utilized in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless .
in the case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the symptoms ( symptom number ) by 25 to 32 % compared with the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving placebo .
in both studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in the symptoms after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % in the patients treated with placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted approval to the Company SP Europe for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union .
a tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , for allevi@@ ating symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical trials to efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous disease progression and can be terminated after the symptoms of the symptoms and resum@@ ed when re@@ occurring .
in the persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) , a continuous treatment can be recommended to the patient during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol was administered additionally ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased when taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to di@@ zz@@ iness which may result in impaired mobility or ability to operate machinery .
in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily compared to patients treated with placebo .
the most frequent side effects reported as placebo were ti@@ redness ( 1,2 % ) , dry mouth dry ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ aches , this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study , at which up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) were given .
this includes the in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the P @-@ sel@@ ect@@ ator expression on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
there was no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect as part of a clinical study with multiple doses that was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily in a dose of up to 20 mg .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the nine @-@ times the clinical dose ) over ten days , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was revealed .
in a single dose study with adults , the lost adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective pun@@ ctu@@ ality or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nose secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , run@@ off and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as symptoms of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown in the overall report of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated as a substitute for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , because the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar to ae@@ ti@@ ology in different forms and chronic patients can be easily pro@@ spec@@ tively recru@@ ited .
since the hist@@ am@@ ination is a caus@@ ative factor in all age @-@ related diseases , it is expected that in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n will also lead to an improvement in symptoms in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines was excluded from the study .
an improvement in it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and w@@ aking as measured by a 4 point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study which compar@@ es the patient demo@@ graphics with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no clu@@ es for clin@@ ically relevant accumulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5 - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , however , has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded .
in @-@ vi@@ vo , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study involving lost adi@@ n at a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty foods rich in calories ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies performed with lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n and lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a comparable degree of the exposure of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on the conventional studies of safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated doses , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years of age are caused by an infection ( see Section 4.4 ) and that no data is available which support a treatment of an infectious Rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis of the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and corresponding laboratory and skin tests should play a role .
around 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabol@@ ise des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience a higher substance load ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to that in children that met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze normally .
this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose de@@ composition or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ - in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine should not be taken .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol was administered additionally ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased when taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group as in the placebo group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us compared to patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in an adult and adol@@ escent dose of up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
children between the ages of 1 and 11 , who were eligible for anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine therapy , received a daily lost dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
in a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg a day over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study in adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the nine @-@ times the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was observed .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dose of 5 mg a day for adults and adolescents , there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
at a single dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents conducted clinical trials with no impair@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ or activity .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol did not result in ampli@@ fication of alcohol @-@ induced performance or an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nose secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , run@@ off and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown in the overall report of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduced the rh@@ initi@@ s caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
the proliferation of this limited metabol@@ ising phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ sia ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
the burden ( AU@@ C ) by the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was approximately 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ X approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ time of approximately 120 hours .
there are no clu@@ es for clin@@ ically relevant active ingredient accumulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5 - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In different single dose studies , AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable with the recommended doses compared with those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , however , has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is offered in type III bra@@ ung@@ bottle bottles with child @-@ proof poly@@ propylene connection cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate must be removed without damaging it .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally applied ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily compared to patients treated with placebo .
in a multi@@ disciplinary study , at which up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) were applied , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data .
there was no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect as part of a clinical study with multiple doses that was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily in a dose of up to 20 mg .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the nine @-@ times the clinical dose ) over ten days , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was revealed .

in a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed 5 mg of no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective pun@@ ctu@@ ality or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nose secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , run@@ off and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown in the overall report of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .

two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg melt tablets once daily put in the mouth for allevi@@ ating symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melting tablet must be removed without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg melt tablets in children under 6 years of age have not been proven so far .
the overall frequency of the side effects between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the placebo group was the same and did not significantly devi@@ ate from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us &apos;s melting tablet proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablet formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at for the formulation of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
as part of a clinical study with multiple doses in which the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg a day over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant effect was observed .
in a single dose study with adults , the lost adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective pun@@ ctu@@ ation or the tasks associated with flying .
the spread of this poorly metabol@@ ising phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pa@@ edi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and in black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) larger than in Cau@@ ca@@ sia ( adults 2 % , children 3 % ) , but the safety profile of these patients was not devi@@ ating from that of the general population .
in single dose @-@ crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us &apos;s melting tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at for taking in were the form@@ ulations bio@@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pedi@@ atric patients , but in combination with the dosage studies in children , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melt tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years .

the safety of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years , which are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to that in children that met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze normally .
this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients should not take this medicine with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose screening or su@@ c@@ rose in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to that of the placebo group .
in infants aged between 6 and 23 months , the most common adverse events reported as placebo were diar@@ rho@@ ea ( 3,@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2.3 % ) .
in an additional study , no side effects were observed in patients aged 6 to 11 at a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg of the lost adi@@ n solution .
at recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see Section 5.2 ) were similar in children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dose of 5 mg a day for adults and adolescents , there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively also be allergic to inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and
as shown in the overall report of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .

since A@@ eri@@ us contains the same concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no bio@@ equivalent study was needed and it is expected that it corresponds to the sy@@ rup and the tablets .
in various single dose studies , AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable with the recommended doses compared with those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .

in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. agreed to the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company will withdraw its application for the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that is intended to protect against a strain of the flu virus that might cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus is emerging , which can easily be spread from people to humans because humans have not built up any imm@@ uni@@ z@@ ity ( no protection ) .
when the vaccine is administered , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the influenza virus that are contained in the vaccine as &quot; foreign &quot; and makes antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system will later be able to establish antibodies in a contact with a flu virus .
subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognizes as foreign body ) , has been cleaned and used as an ingredient of the vaccine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the guidelines of the E@@ MEA for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you are taking part in a clinical trial and require further information on your treatment , please contact your attending physician .
if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immuno@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immuno@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , A@@ gener@@ a is available as a solution for taking , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination has not been studied .
A@@ gener@@ a should be ordered only if the doctor has checked what anti@@ viral drugs the patient had previously taken , and the likel@@ ihood of the virus to respond to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which is taken together with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily and with other anti@@ viral drugs .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ then@@ ase depends on body weight .
in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase decreases the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level .
AIDS cannot be cured , but it can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS .
A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
in 20@@ 6 adults who used prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors with low @-@ dos@@ ed ri@@ de@@ on@@ avi@@ r drugs were compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the changes in the viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had not previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , after 48 weeks more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml than placebo , but A@@ gener@@ a was less effective than In@@ car@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ a also reduced the viral load , but only very few people responded to the treatment by the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
in the study with adults treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the drug A@@ gener@@ ase increased the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gener@@ a combined with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger anti @-@ viral load after four weeks compared to patients who received further prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , nausea , nausea , vom@@ iting , skin rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ a may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
it may also not be used in patients who take St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines that are degra@@ ded just as much as as@@ cer@@ ase and are inj@@ ected in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take ap@@ generations reduce the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , an o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ one ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
generic A@@ gener@@ ase is typically used in combination with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r amplifier , but the committee noted that the use of as@@ th@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had not previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not detected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Limited to the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited for the transport of A@@ gener@@ ase throughout the European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years .
generally , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should be carried out taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 600 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying additive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ gen@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children .
generic A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under the age of 4 , due to lack of data for harm@@ lessness and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase in adult patients with moderate liver function should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with mild or moderate cir@@ rho@@ sis , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
it may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and are also substrates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ cc@@ m 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r during the intake of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ a or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
generally , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver problems with potentially fatal outcome .
for the case of con@@ current anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show increased incidence of liver dys@@ functions under anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored in line with clinical practice .
simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ id that are metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oidal effects including C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al glands ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin is not recommended due to the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the concentration of active substances are available .
for patients taking this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase may be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the efficacy of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , but the information is insufficient to estimate the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored to take O@@ pi@@ ate withdrawal symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under the age of four and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ a should be set in duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases that could be used to treat medications associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. higher age , and with drug dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in the case of ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ le patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges including spontaneous cut@@ aneous ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma and ha@@ em@@ o@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis are reported .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections leading to severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms .
although multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is assumed ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 medi@@ ums with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and are also substrates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ cc@@ m 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 medi@@ ums with less therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must@@ n &apos;t be combined with medicines , whose active ingredients are mainly met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are linked to increased plasma levels with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
in the attempt to compensate the humili@@ ated plasma concentration through a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse events were observed in the liver .
St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be brought low by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the det@@ on@@ ate levels and , if possible , check the viral load and susp@@ end the St. John &apos;s Wort .
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary if nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % increased , by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this regi@@ stra@@ r .
52 % lower if det@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was given .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which have been achieved twice daily with the combination of am@@ dynam@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are about 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of pren@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but close monitoring is recommended , as the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was carried out in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but it is recommended that the proceeds from Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and ri@@ de@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , dose adjustment is not necessary .
the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that the ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may reduce the serum concentration of det@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised , because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ dine could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plas@@ m@@ ack@@ et .
if these drugs are used together , caution is advisable ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out , as an accurate pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ dine is difficult .
the simultaneous addition of det@@ on@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % and thus to an increase in side effects connected with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with as@@ cer@@ ase , at least half of the recommended dose is recommended to reduce the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin , although no clinical data is available for this purpose .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , but the plasma levels of both drugs may be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ dynam@@ ical and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to 2,@@ 69@@ fold compared to the value observed once daily without the simultaneous application of Fos@@ am@@ dynam@@ ical with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines listed below , including substrates , inhibit@@ ors or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ duc@@ tors , may possibly interact with A@@ gener@@ ase .
patients should therefore be monitored using toxic reactions that are associated with these medicines when used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as as@@ th@@ ase , as it can cause resor@@ ption disorders .
the simultaneous application of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ va , known as enzyme induc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ eli@@ can , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine , and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by 10 through Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of this medicine .
simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ing with as@@ gen@@ ase can considerably increase the plasma concentrations and intensi@@ fy with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in combination with side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days at subjects , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma concentration increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol declined by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous addition of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these glu@@ co@@ co@@ ti@@ co@@ id , unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oidal effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are to be expected to increase the level of plasma gas at the same time as ap@@ ati@@ ase .
since plasma @-@ cone increases of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of these medicines with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations up to stabili@@ zation of the mirrors is recommended as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased at the same time as Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used together with oral mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while using par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is advisable .
data for the simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma concentration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 to 4 times .
when meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored to take O@@ pi@@ ate withdrawal symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation as to how the det@@ on@@ avi@@ rus dosage is to be adjusted when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one .
at the same time war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not fores@@ eeable , so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are also recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may only be used during pregnancy after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk lac@@ ri@@ fying rats , ammon@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether pren@@ avi@@ rus passes into breast milk in humans .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by evap@@ oration in the uter@@ us up to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight in the offspring .
the further development of offspring , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not impaired by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , occurred early and rarely led to the termination of treatment .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are in connection with taking A@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
most of the reported side effects come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ a twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) that were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as related to the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as laboratory changes that occur under the treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and fast sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of breasts and dor@@ so@@ cereb@@ ral fat accumulation .
in 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated persons who had been treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ u@@ dine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ dine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( Sti@@ ern@@ acken ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 in 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients in Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under In@@ car@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
skin r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ane nature , with or without it@@ ching and appeared spontaneously during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in the case of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre@@ treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ a twice daily with low @-@ dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of side effects ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable ; an exception were increases in tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride and CP@@ K levels observed in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase along with low @-@ dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in the case of over@@ dosing , the patient is to be observed on signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the processing of viral G@@ ag@@ - and ga@@ g @-@ polar poly@@ esters with the result of a formation of irregular , non infectious viral particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro for HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ CC@@ RF , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % Hem@@ p concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M with ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells .
the connection between the activity of pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans has not yet been defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ dynam@@ ite / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , as in other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment schemes with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the mut@@ ations described have rarely been observed .
at sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , with 14 Isol@@ ate gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isolation of 13 of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure within the 59 included , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not show pre @-@ treated patients , showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults .

in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day : n = 107 ) in patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were detected :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic evaluation systems based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / R , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance on Fos@@ am@@ dynam@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a decreased likel@@ ihood of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended that the current interpretation systems be used to analyze the results of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for estim@@ ating the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic Cut @-@ offs for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic samples generates a certain cross @-@ resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data for cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients , in which a Fos@@ am@@ dynam@@ ite @-@ containing scheme failed ( one of them showed resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
vice versa , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ; obtaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resist@@ ence mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early abor@@ tion of a promising therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations that can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which adults treated with PI ( 600@@ mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ gn@@ alo@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , mainly with low @-@ dose ri@@ de@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and thre@@ es@@ core ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis demonstrated the non @-@ sub@@ superi@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in comparison to the time @-@ added average change from the initial value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ partial threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
evidence of the efficacy of untreated as@@ gen@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase was used twice daily , 20 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low @-@ dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml for a medi@@ an increase of CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to bas@@ eline .
19 Based on this data , the expected benefits of &quot; untreated &quot; as@@ cer@@ ase should be considered in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI .
after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) up to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ MA@@ x , by contrast , reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decline in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by food intake , although the simultaneous food intake affected the extent and rate of resor@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and lets closed on a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of det@@ on@@ avi@@ r from the blood circulation into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bon@@ ded am@@ b@@ radi@@ a , which represents the active part , is likely to remain unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage share of the free active component during dosing intervals varies depending on the total drug concentration in the ste@@ ady state over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and represent a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 should be administered with caution when given at the same time using as@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily amp@@ utation as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is less bio@@ available from the solution than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram @-@ basis .
ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction on the elimination of det@@ on@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ de@@ on@@ avi@@ r is likely to be low .
these regi@@ mens lead to det@@ on@@ avi@@ r plasma levels similar to those obtained from healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without the simultaneous appointment of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with det@@ on@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , malign@@ ant h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas oc@@ cured in male animals , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the development of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the existing exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies and from the therapeutic application .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vitro and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations of human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , it was neither mut@@ agen or gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
until now no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients was observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ a nor after the end of the treatment .
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated from an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with det@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in a systemic plasma display , which was significantly inferior to ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to therapeu@@ tical dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thym@@ us ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes have been observed that indicate a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ a capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying additive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ a ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with mild or mild liver dysfunction . in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the concentration of active substances are available .
A@@ gener@@ a should be stopped in the long run 27 when a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
increased risk of Li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as increased age , and with drug dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increased , by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which have been achieved twice daily with the combination of am@@ dynam@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are about 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of pren@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but close monitoring is recommended , as the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
if these drugs are used together , caution is advisable ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out , as an accurate pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ dine is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ cer@@ ase , at least half of the recommended dose is recommended at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available for this purpose .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , Nic@@ ola pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine , and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r thus increasing the activity and toxic@@ ity of this medicine .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days at subjects , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma concentration increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol declined by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
at the same time war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
simultaneous administration of Or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ one ) led to a 22 % decline in the AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
this medicine may only be used during pregnancy after careful consideration of potential benefits for the mother compared to possible risks to the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by evap@@ oration in the uter@@ us up to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a decreased weight in the offspring during breast@@ feeding .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in the case of over@@ dosing , the patient is to be observed on signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro for HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ CC@@ RF , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % Hem@@ p concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M with ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
vice versa , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ; obtaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resist@@ ence mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on this data , the expected benefits of &quot; untreated &quot; as@@ cer@@ ase should be considered in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage share of the free active component during dosing intervals varies depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and represent a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 should be administered with caution when given at the same time using as@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .

studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated from an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with det@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that in young the Met@@ abol@@ ism paths are not yet fully mature , so that Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z .
the A@@ gener@@ ase solution is used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years .
the benefits of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &apos;s &quot; B@@ oo@@ ster@@ d &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for the use of patients treated with PI had not yet been demonstrated with PI pre@@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should stop taking the capsules once they are able to stop taking the solution to intake ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ b@@ ular rot@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , as no dosage recommendation can be given for simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to use and low dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination should be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dose adjustment for Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ col content , A@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in infants and children under 4 years of age , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these medicines and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ( z . ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ a or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the concentration of active substances are available .

increased risk of Li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as increased age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in the case of ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ le patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges including spontaneous cut@@ aneous ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma and ha@@ em@@ o@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis are reported .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increased , by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ing with as@@ gen@@ ase can considerably increase the plasma concentrations and lead to side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
based on the data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors , significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected after the oral dose of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not well @-@ known . as a result of possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the contained Prop@@ ylene gly@@ col can not be used during pregnancy ( see Section 4.3 ) .
in the milk lac@@ ri@@ fying rats , ammon@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether pren@@ avi@@ rus passes into breast milk in humans .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by evap@@ oration in the uter@@ us up to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a reduced 55 body weight in the offspring during breast@@ feeding .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are in connection with taking A@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ dynam@@ ite / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , as in other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment schemes with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the mut@@ ations described have rarely been observed .
early abor@@ tion of a promising 60 therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations that can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on this data , the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; untreated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gen@@ ase should be considered in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows to close the blood circulation into the tissue by a large Vet@@ tis@@ ation volume as well as an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of the blood circulation into the tissue .

dose of A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es amounts to 600 mg twice daily with 100 mg of ri@@ de@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in order to achieve the greatest possible benefit , it is very important that you take the entire daily dose prescribed by your doctor .
if you have taken larger amounts of as@@ th@@ ase than you should if you have taken more than the prescribed dose of as@@ th@@ ase , you should contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the use of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ oo@@ ster@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for use in patients treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors has not yet been demonstrated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for applying low doses of ri@@ de@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( usually applied to ampli@@ fication of the effect &#91; boost &#93; of A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es ) along with A@@ gener@@ ase solution to inhal@@ e , no dosage recommendations can be given .
use the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r solution , or take Prop@@ ylene gly@@ col during the take of A@@ gener@@ ase solution ( see also A@@ gener@@ ase may not be taken ) .
your doctor may be aware of side effects associated with the propylene gly@@ col content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take in , especially if you have kidney or liver disease .
111 If you take certain medicines that can cause serious side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , li@@ do@@ ca@@ ine , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in , at the same time as as@@ cer@@ ase , your doctor may perform additional blood tests to minimize any potential security problems .

important information about certain other ingredients of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking the solution to intake contains Prop@@ ylene gly@@ col , which can lead to side effects in high doses .
Prop@@ ylene gly@@ col can cause a number of side effects including sei@@ zur@@ es , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and the reduction of red blood cells ( see also A@@ gener@@ ase may not be taken , special caution when taking A@@ gener@@ ase is required precau@@ tions ) .
if you forgot the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase If you have forgotten taking A@@ gener@@ ase , take it once you think about it and then continue taking as before .
headache , fatigue , vom@@ iting , vom@@ iting , blo@@ ating skin rash ( redness , bli@@ sters or it@@ ching ) - occasional skin rash may be of serious nature and force you to stop taking this medicine .
this can include fat loss on legs , arms and in the face , a fat increase on the abdom@@ en and in other internal organs , breast aug@@ mentation and obesity in the neck ( &quot; Sti@@ ern@@ acken &quot; ) .
other ingredients are propylene gly@@ col , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ( pol@@ yethylene gly@@ col 400 ) , to@@ co@@ fer@@ sol@@ an ( T@@ P@@ GS ) , ac@@ es@@ ul@@ f@@ am potassium , su@@ c@@ rose sodium , sodium chlori@@ de , artificial g@@ ums , sodium cit@@ rate di@@ am@@ y@@ dra@@ t , puri@@ fied water .
the frequency and duration of the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the condition to be treated : • In case of case infections in the genital area , the cream will be applied three times a week for six weeks . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , it can be applied five times a week during one or two weeks of treatment , with four weeks interval between treatment cycles , three times a week .
before bed@@ time , the cream is dil@@ uted to the affected skin areas so that it remains sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies in 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies in which the patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or placebo either daily or five times weekly .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after 12 weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete healing rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in the patients treated with placebo . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete healing rate of 66 % to 80 % in the patients treated with placebo compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , not hyper@@ kerat@@ otic , not hyper@@ trop@@ otic , non hyper@@ trop@@ ic kerat@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or scal@@ p of immuno@@ competent adults , if the size or number of lesi@@ ons limit the efficacy and / or acceptance of cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .
on Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday before going to bed and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream is continued until all visible genital war@@ ts have disappeared in the genital or per@@ ic@@ ral region , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment procedure described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated lesi@@ ons are only cured completely , another therapy should be initiated ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient will have to apply the cream as soon as he / she noticed this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan .
apply the i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream in a thin layer and rub in the puri@@ fied , infected skin area until the cream is completely covered .
it should take place in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
it should take place in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus host@@ - reaction .
in other studies , in which no daily pre @-@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and one case were observed with a stri@@ k@@ tur for circumc@@ ision .
in the case of an application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in higher than recommended doses there is an increased risk of severe local irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases severe local skin irrit@@ ations have been observed , which have necess@@ itated treatment and / or have led to temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the outlet of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulties in ur@@ ination , which necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
until now no clinical experiences are available for the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream immediately after the treatment with other cut@@ aneous applied methods for the treatment of external genital war@@ ts in the genital and per@@ ic@@ ral region .
although limited data suggest a higher rate of inclin@@ ation reductions in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has shown lower efficacy in this group of patients with regard to the elimination of the genital war@@ ts .
treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips or hair@@ line was not examined .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during therapy or the reactions form after conclusion of the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s discomfort or due to the severity of local skin reactions , a treatment break may be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy may be assessed after regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since no data on long @-@ term cure rates of more than 36 months after treatment are available , other suitable therapy forms should be considered in the case of super @-@ defici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs no clinical experience is present , therefore the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tumours .
data from an open clinical trial indicate that large tumours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) have less likel@@ ihood of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , on the inside of the nose or in the ears or on the lips of the lips .
there are only very limited data on the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands does not support the efficacy of this application , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions are frequent , but these reactions usually decrease in the course of the treatment or go back after de@@ compos@@ ing the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine cream .
if local skin reactions cause severe discomfort to the patient or are very strong , treatment may be suspended for a few days .
data from an open clinical study showed that patients with more than 8 lesi@@ ons showed a lower complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesi@@ ons .
due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine should be applied with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
from animal studies no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , de@@ binding or post@@ nat@@ al development are produced ( see 5.3 ) .
although quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) are not achieved after one @-@ off or several times topical application , no recommendation can be given during breast@@ feeding .
the most commonly reported and as prob@@ able or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream related side effects in the trials with three weeks of treatment were local reactions at the site of the treatment of the genital war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
among the most frequently reported and as prob@@ able or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream related side effects include complaints at the application location with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream from a placebo @-@ controlled phase III clinical trial reported side effects are shown below .
the most common , as likely or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream related side effect , were in these studies a reaction to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
adverse events reported by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ osis are listed below .
according to the test plan , this placebo @-@ controlled clinical trial demonstrated that these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials often came to local skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ them ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cre@@ ori@@ ation / abor@@ tion / shed ( 23 % ) and o@@ ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see Section 4.4 ) .
according to the test plan , this review of clinical signs shows that in these trials , with five times weekly treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream , it was very common to severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and to severe de@@ formation and cal@@ or@@ isation ( 19 % ) .
in clinical studies investigating the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was found with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment site or in the surrounding area .
the occasional or@@ ale recording of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
clin@@ ically severe side effects , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , existed in hyp@@ ot@@ onia , which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid .
after the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , increasing systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigations .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies , efficacy was clearly superior to a complete recovery of the inclin@@ ation during an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment .
at 60 % of the total of 119 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od the patients were completely healed ; this was the case at 20 % of the 105 patients who were treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 15@@ 7 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od at five times per week for 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed individual primary super@@ fici@@ als bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data obtained from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od during three weeks of use in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week treatment @-@ free period , was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , not hyper@@ trop@@ ic , hyper@@ trop@@ hic acne lesi@@ ons within a related 25 c@@ m2 area of treatment on the scal@@ p or face .
the annual data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications of pron@@ oun@@ cements , ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ osis and super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma generally do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and therefore have not been studied .
Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double blind placebo @-@ controlled trials on children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not shown in these studies in the dos@@ ages investigated there ( 3@@ x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively ) .
minimal systemic inclusion of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed during the three @-@ week application during 16 weeks .
the highest concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml when applied in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 disposable bags ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the estimated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates prolonged retention of the medicine in the skin .
the data on the systemic exposure showed that the resor@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low after topical application to MC @-@ ill skin of patients aged 6 to 12 years and was comparable to that with healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ osis or super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on the der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study on der@@ mal application , which was conducted for four months , showed no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice on three days a week did not indu@@ ce tum@@ ors in the application .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low system absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , a risk for man due to the systemic exposure seems to be very low .
the tum@@ ors oc@@ cured in the group of mice treated with the toxic @-@ free cream , earlier and in larger number than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you feel uncomfortable during the use of Al@@ dar@@ a Cream .
if your skin re@@ acts too strongly to treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a Cream , you should not continue using the cream , wash the affected skin area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
a reduced number of blood cells can make you more suscep@@ tible to infections ; it can cause you to quickly create a blue stain or cause fatigue .
inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will affect you considerably or you notice any side effects not stated in this use information .
in addition , you can feel it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas you have applied to Al@@ dar@@ a Cream ( 8 % of patients ) .
usually these are lighter skin reactions , which end up in about 2 weeks after the treatment has been terminated .
occasionally , some patients notice changes in the application location ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , sharp@@ ness , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nausea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not broken down and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non @-@ neurological symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints that complic@@ ate movements , reduce pulmon@@ ary volume , heart and eye diseases .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic disorders .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ alizing devices , and patients may need appropriate drugs before administration to prevent an allergic reaction .

the study was mainly focused on the safety of the drug , but its efficacy was also measured by examining its effect on the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver .
in children under the age of five Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the children treated showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions at the in@@ fusion point .
very common adverse events in patients under the age of five are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of pulmon@@ ary function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( acceler@@ ating heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may react strongly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review every year any new information that may be known , and if necessary update this summary if necessary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me with regard to the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.V. to bring Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me to the European Union .
lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of the human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enz@@ ym@@ atic therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic disorders .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient carries this , can be increased every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me may develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , these patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical setting where medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that almost all Ig@@ G patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the start of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer break , the risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions must be cau@@ ti@@ ously avoided due to the theoretically increased risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction .
pre@@ treatment 60 minutes before the onset of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and / or antibodies ) in order to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in the event of mild or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or reduction of in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms have been reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 . ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or Proc@@ ain because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ ing with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal studies do not directly or indirectly affect the pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see paragraph 5.3 ) .
since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase via breast milk are available , it is recommended not to lac@@ tate during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me .
adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in phase 3 ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under the age of 5 ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions associated with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me , which have been observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 or older with a duration of up to 4 years , are listed in the following table following the following frequency : very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory and facial ede@@ ma ( see Section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted drug effects related to Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 , with mostly severe follow @-@ up form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients underwent a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment , with a more severe form of follow @-@ up during the age of 5 ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) .
until the end of the phase III trial ( or until early retirement from the trial ) , 13 / 45 patients had no det@@ ectable antibodies ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , including 3 patients , in which there had never been a trial version .
patients with low to low antibody levels reported a robust reduction in the G@@ AG level in the urine , while in patients with high antibody ti@@ tr@@ es a variable reduction of G@@ AG was detected in the urine .
four patients ( three in the phase III study and one in the phase 2 trial ) showed a marginal to low @-@ neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro , which did not seem to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme replacement therapy lies in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ str@@ ata and the prevention of further accumulation of the enzyme activity .
after IV in@@ fusion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lys@@ os@@ omes , most likely via mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study involving the entire spectrum of disease , the majority of patients were from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change in expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension study , where they received a further 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and walking ability presented in the following table .
the open renewal study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo @-@ Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as highlighted in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is not clin@@ ically significant over this period and the absolute pulmon@@ ary volumes increased proportion@@ ately to the body size of growing children .
of the 26 patients with hepatitis B , 22 ( 85 % ) reached normal liver size by the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks , a significant decrease in the G@@ AG mirrors in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) was found , which remained constant until the end of the study .
with regard to the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients , which was taken into account by using a combined end@@ point which clin@@ ically consoli@@ dates clin@@ ically significant changes across the efficacy variable ( expected percent@@ ages of normal FE@@ V , range of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was examined primarily for the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion ( 16 patients with severe exp@@ ir@@ ation form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - levels in urine in the last 26 weeks .
in several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined by the Z @-@ Score for this age group . younger patients with the mean follow @-@ up form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental development speed , whereas in older patients with severe follow @-@ up form only limited or no progress was detected in cognitive development .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms dosing regi@@ mens were performed on the G@@ AG mirrors in urine , liver volume and 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosing schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks may be a substitute for patients experiencing weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , but it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosage schemes is equal .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will assess any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients under the age of 5 was similar to those affected by older and less severely affected patients .
based on the conventional studies of safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with one @-@ off dose , toxic@@ ity in repeated application and reproduction of reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
since no tolerance studies have been carried out , this drug may not be bl@@ ended with other medicines , except those listed under 6 . 6 .

an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during the in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
if you use Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me with other medicines please inform your doctor if you take medicines that contain Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or Proc@@ ain because there is a possible risk of dimin@@ ished effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken , including non @-@ prescription drugs .
advice on handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate for the manufacture of an in@@ fusion solution must be th@@ inn@@ ed before application and is intended for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors and medical professionals ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient carries this , is gradually increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , however , severe reactions were observed , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing still@@ s and facial ede@@ ma .
very common ( incidence of more than 1 out of 10 patients ) : • headache • nausea • abdominal pain • rash • Joint diseases , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • Er@@ r@@ ors • F@@ ills • Hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the in@@ fusion point

preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • Dep@@ ending on the body weight of the individual patient , first determine the number of penet@@ rating water bottles .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( medicine against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is likely to spread slightly to other parts of the body .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole therapy in patients who have not previously been treated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies .
in order to reduce side effects , patients should receive a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti@@ em@@ etic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( medicine against vom@@ iting ) and fluids should be given before or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( to prevent lack of liquid ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in patients whose blood image changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , lowered or the dose is reduced .
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed thus s@@ lows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
the transformation of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form is easier to replace in cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the medicine and a longer active duration in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural tube , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared to the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another medicine against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9,@@ 3 months in the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ t was 8.3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months with doc@@ et@@ axel .
in both studies , however , patients in which the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells showed longer survival in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta than with the comparative drug .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.V. to transport A@@ lim@@ ta to the entire European Union .
every bottle of diar@@ rhe@@ a must be dissolved with a 4.@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dos@@ ages is taken from the flow plate and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with loc@@ - and advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer , except for predomin@@ ant disc epitheli@@ al hi@@ stones ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given the day before and on the day of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed application as well as on the day after the treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the dose must be continued throughout the treatment period as well as another 21 days after the last p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients also have to receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) a week before the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dosage and after each third operation cycle .
in patients receiving p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , a full blood image should be created before each application , including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle a dose examination must take account of the N@@ adi@@ s of the blood or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous therapy cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the instructions in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are applicable for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Level 2 bleeding .
should patients not develop hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ Grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient has the value before treatment
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity grade 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 can reduc@@ ti@@ o- or no @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 years or above , there is an increased side effects risk in patients aged 65 and under age 65 .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 because of insufficient data for harm@@ lessness and efficacy .
in clinical trials patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min have no dose adjustments that go beyond the dose adjustments that are recommended for all patients .
the data layer in patients with a Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a dysfunction of &gt; 1.5 @-@ times the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ by limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3,@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( for liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5,@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( for the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically investigated in the studies .
patients must be monitored with respect to bone mar@@ row and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed should not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ene number has reg@@ ained a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ - number of cells again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
dose reduction for further cycles is based on the number of absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity observed in the previous treatment cycles ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and non@@ sexual toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia were observed when pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed need to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a proph@@ yl@@ actic measure for the reduction of treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate kidney failure ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ing non @-@ ster@@ oidal anti @-@ inflammatory drugs ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ sali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients for whom a therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is required must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients in whom these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events including de@@ hydr@@ ation , high blood pressure or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the eff@@ u@@ ction before p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment should be considered .
5 Sever@@ al cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed unless this active ingredient was administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated living vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
as the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible deterioration of reproductive capacity is due to p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be pointed out before the treatment procedure , to obtain advice on how to preserve sperm .
in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ clearing ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oidal anti @-@ inflammatory drugs ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 3 g daily ) can result in reduced p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ digestion with the result of increased occurrence of side effects .
precau@@ tion is therefore advisable if high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage should be used in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ clearing ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b are available , simultaneous use with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - mixed .
the in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of coag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy require an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants .
there is no data for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - or an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites severe labour defects are expected in an application during pregnancy .
p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed should not be used during pregnancy , except if it is essential and careful consideration of benefits for the mother and risk for fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
as the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible damage to reproductive capacity is due to p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be pointed out before the treatment begins to obtain advice on how to block the sperm .
it is not known whether p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is passed into the breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be ruled out .
the following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma and the random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed as well as 16@@ 3 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma who were random@@ ised to receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .
side effects : very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 and &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 and &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) and not known ( based on the available data of spontaneous reports ) .

clinical relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity grade 3 and 4 was similar in phase 2 of three single p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed mono@@ therap@@ i@@ estu@@ dies ( n = 16@@ 4 ) of phase 2 , excluding neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to result in differences in the patient population as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies included both chem@@ o@@ ai@@ ve and well @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal outcomes in liver function tests .

severe cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular insul@@ t and trans@@ itory an@@ a@@ emia were reported in clinical trials with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , which is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .
from clinical studies , occasional cases of co@@ li@@ tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal per@@ fo@@ - ration , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ litis ) were reported in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment .
clinical trials have occasionally reported cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis associated with respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment .
it has been reported on cases of acute ren@@ al failure in mixed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy agents ( see Section 4.4 ) .
cases of radi@@ otherapy were reported in patients that were be@@ amed before , during or after their mixed therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ) is a ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate that ex@@ erts its effect by disrup@@ ting important , consequ@@ ent , fol@@ lic acid @-@ dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies show that p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is used as an anti@@ fol@@ ate with several targets by blocking thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ l syn@@ th@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and gly@@ cin@@ am@@ i@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ de @-@ m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , which are fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes of the de nov@@ o bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ ine and pur@@ pl@@ oti@@ des .

primary analysis of this study was conducted in the population of all patients receiving the investig@@ ational medication ( random@@ ized and treated ) in the treatment arm .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 12 patients ) in relation to the ultrasound C@@ is@@ pla@@ - tin @-@ arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms showed an improvement in the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deterioration of lung function in the control arm over time .
a multi@@ center , random@@ ised , open phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA versus doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after prior chemotherapy was a medi@@ an survival time of 8.3 months in patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( In@@ tent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and of 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the overall survival benefit from A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSCLC with a predominantly non @-@ fet@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 3@@ 99 , 9.@@ 3 versus 8.@@ 4 months , adapted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data from a separate random@@ ized , controlled phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 5@@ 40 ) pre@@ treatment are similar to doc@@ et@@ axel .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ sub@@ superi@@ ority of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in combination with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
mean P@@ FS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 1.@@ 15 ) for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 28.@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1,4 ) for the combination gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the analysis of the impact of the hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences in hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = confidence interval ; IT@@ T = Cover @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = size of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ superi@@ ority , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) significantly below the non @-@ lower limit of 1,@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin needed fewer trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 1 % versus 27.@@ 3 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) and thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) .
patients also needed the administration of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin / Dar@@ b@@ opo@@ e@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3.1 % versus 6.@@ 1 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron preparations ( 4,@@ 3 % versus 7.@@ 0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed as a mono@@ therapeutic were examined in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with various solid tumours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fu@@ si@@ - zones over a period of 10 minutes .
p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose is found unchanged within 24 hours after application in urine .
p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed has a total of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and half @-@ life in plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ clearing 90 ml / min ) .
in a study involving Be@@ ag@@ le dogs who received intraven@@ ous bol@@ us inj@@ ections for 9 months , Tes@@ tic lesi@@ ons were observed ( degeneration / nec@@ ro@@ sis of the sem@@ ini@@ fer@@ ous epitheli@@ al tissue ) .
unless otherwise used , the retention periods and conditions after preparation are in the user &apos;s responsibility and should normally not exceed 24 hours at 2 to 8 ° C unless the preparation / di@@ lution has taken place under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions .

the resulting solution is clear and the colour ranges from color@@ less to yellow or green @-@ yellow without compromising the quality of the products .
it is used in overweight adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with a low @-@ cal@@ orie , fat @-@ reduced diet .
patients who take All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they can &apos;t break down some fats in the food , causing about a quarter of the fats that have been added to the food in@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ine .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo in 3@@ 91 patients .
in both studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took All@@ i 60 mg after one year had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
in the study involving patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss for patients could be observed .
the most common side @-@ effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s at the anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stu@@ ff@@ ing , stu@@ d@@ ld@@ iness , gre@@ asy @-@ o@@ ily stools , down@@ turn o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( f@@ ences ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it may not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( for prevention of organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may not be used in patients suffering from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which not enough nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant or nursing mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Limited to the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited for the placing of list@@ at GS@@ K throughout the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ the@@ or@@ ic , fat @-@ reduced diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since or@@ list@@ at is only resor@@ bed to a minimum , it is not necessary to adjust the dosage in elderly and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• Con@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the ingredients • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.5 ) • Chr@@ onic mal@@ absorption syndrome • chol@@ est@@ ase • pregnancy ( see Section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if taken together with a fat @-@ rich individual meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
since the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a physician or chem@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic should be adjusted .
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated blood cholesterol should consult their physician or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage needs to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnancy prevention measures in order to prevent the oral contrac@@ eption possible in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma concentration was observed .
for the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( internationally recognized ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients treated with or@@ list@@ at up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta carot@@ ene remained normal .
however , patients should be advised to take a complementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before going to sleep in order to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see Section 4.4 ) .
following the administration of a one @-@ off dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a marginal decrease in the am@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time .
animal studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see paragraph 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are linked to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the medicine , as the absorption of worn fat is prevented .
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not predictable ) .
the frequency of reported side effects identified after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown , since these events were reported voluntarily by a population of uncertain res@@ ent@@ ment .
† It is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to conver@@ sions with regard to possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and obes@@ e patients over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosage , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as with the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on studies on humans and animals , rapid reg@@ ression of possible systemic effects caused by or@@ list@@ at &apos;s li@@ mat@@ orium characteristics can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect places in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine through co@@ valent bonds to active Ser@@ in remn@@ ants of ga@@ stri@@ c and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pas@@ es .
from clinical studies it was derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocked the absorption of about 25 % of the dietary fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled trials in adults with BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ the@@ or@@ ic , fat @-@ reduced diet .
primary parameters , the change in body weight compared to bas@@ eline ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was rated as follows : as a change in body weight in the study course ( Table 1 ) and as a share of those study participants who lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first six months .
the average cholesterol in Gesamt@@ chol@@ esterin was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in LD@@ L cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % with or@@ list@@ at ( bas@@ eline 3,@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( initial value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
in waist circum@@ ference , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3,@@ 6 cm ( original value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after the or@@ ally administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could be detected spor@@ adi@@ cally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of an accumulation .
in a study with obes@@ e patients , which was administered to a minimum of system@@ ically @-@ absorbed dose , two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after separation of the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l leu@@ cine group ) were identified , representing nearly 42 % of the total plasma concentration .
based on conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated doses , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data can no longer detect any particular risk to humans .

the most common side effects are related to the mode of action of the capsules , resulting in increased fat from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks after the treatment begins , as you may have not yet reduced the amount of fat in your diet .
with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize diet @-@ related accompan@@ im@@ ents : • Beg@@ in already a few days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of the portions you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Divi@@ de your recommended amount of fat evenly across daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you are allowed to take per meal , not to take it in the form of a fat @-@ rich main court or a durable table @-@ table , as you possibly have done in other programs for weight reduction . • Most people in whom these accompanying symptoms occur , learn to control them with time by adjusting their diet .
• Ke@@ ep medicines for children in@@ accessible . • They may not be used any longer after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date stated on the wrap . • Ke@@ ep the container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lica gel that serve to keep the capsules dry .
don &apos;t miss it . • You can take your daily dose all@@ i in the blue transport box ( shuttle ) which is included in this package .

overweight has an impact on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • hyper@@ tension • Diabetes • Heart Disease • Canc@@ ell@@ ation • Cer@@ tain cancers • O@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis Please contact your doctor about your risk for these diseases .
sustained weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and exercise , can prevent serious illness and has a positive impact on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients and learn gradually to nour@@ ish yourself permanently healthy .
energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you will also find as an indication of food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take per day .
the recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal .
which amount is suitable for you , take a look at the information below , which speci@@ fies the number of calories that is appropriate for you . • D@@ ue to the action of the capsule , compliance with recommended fat intake is critical .
if you take the same amount of fat as up to now , this may mean that your body cannot handle this amount of fat .
by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maximize weight and at the same time reduce the likel@@ ihood of diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms .
34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to gradually and continuously lose about 0.5 kg a week without developing fru@@ stration and disappointment .
the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; Minimum physical activity &quot; means that you only do little or nothing at all , work in the garden or perform other physical activities . • &quot; Medium Physi@@ cal Activity &quot; means that you burn 150 calories per day , e.g. by 3 km walk , 30@@ - to 45 @-@ minute gardening or 2 km of running in 15 minutes .
• For a sustained weight loss it is necessary to set realistic calcium and fat goals and also adhere to them . • Sen@@ se is a dietary diary containing information on the calories and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed on cal@@ orie and fat patterns and provide guidelines to become more physically active .
in combination with a program tailored to your type to support weight loss , this information can help you to develop a healthier lifestyle and achieve your target weight .
Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as for chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine used as an anti@@ em@@ etic ) .
the application in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended , as there is not enough information on the effects in this age group .
this means that the active agent prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) to inhi@@ bit recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
in three main studies Alo@@ xi was examined in three main studies involving 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong or moderate stimul@@ ants for nausea and vom@@ iting .
for chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi were not vom@@ iting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in chemotherapy , the moderate stimulus for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi reported no outbreak in 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 out of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd to appro@@ ve the transport of Alo@@ xi throughout the European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indicated : for the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in severely em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy because of a cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy because of a cancer .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting caused by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy may be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given before chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the thickness of the colon , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection should be closely monitored .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agonists , caution is advisable with simultaneous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in cases where the Q@@ T interval is extended or which tend to such an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi should not be used for prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days after chemotherapy .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics directed against tum@@ ors ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ top@@ ab@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) .
a clinical study showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady St@@ ate@@ - Con@@ centr@@ ation or@@ ally Met@@ o@@ clo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , the simultaneous addition of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hibit@@ ors ( D@@ exam@@ eth@@ as@@ one and Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( am@@ i@@ o@@ dar@@ one , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience on the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies does not occur , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician .
clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 mc@@ g of observed side effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which could at least be associated with Alo@@ xi , headache ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the location ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience reports .
the group with the highest dose revealed similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effect relationships observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , however , due to the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy for an over@@ dosage of alo@@ e .
in two random@@ ised double blind studies a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1.500 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life time : 7.@@ 3 hours ) were compared to day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ized double blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ine as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 .
results of studies with the medi@@ cally em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of chem@@ o@@ therapies are summ@@ arized in the following tables .
in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval were comparable to the effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy subjects was the evaluation of the EC@@ G effects of I.@@ V. administered pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
resor@@ ption After IV administration is followed by an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination of the body with an average termin@@ ale half @-@ time of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ proportional in the entire dose area of 0.@@ 3@@ 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
after the intraven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations indicate that once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with the value measured after one @-@ time IV administration of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was 0.@@ 75 mg higher following the single @-@ recur@@ rent dosage .
about 40 % are eliminated through the kidneys and about 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites which have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
in @-@ vitro studies on metabolism showed that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , are involved in the I@@ so@@ c C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 in the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination after an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 mc@@ g / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ modified ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a single intraven@@ ous bol@@ us injection , the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the terminal elimination terminal and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , but a reduction in the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered sufficient above the maximum human @-@ therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use .
10 Accor@@ ding to prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , evidence suggests that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations that are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and can extend the duration of action .
high doses Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to approximately 30 @-@ times the therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given daily for over two years , resulted in increased incidence of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al marks ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ xi is intended for one @-@ off application in humans , the relevance of these results is assessed low for humans .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report in which the failure of approval for the marketing of the drug Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution was recommended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means al@@ ph@@ eon should resemble a biological drug called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the same drug , which is already approved in the EU ( also referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicines &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by a viral infection ) .
in the case of a micro@@ scopic examination , the liver tissue damage damages , furthermore , the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are significantly increased in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) is introduced , which stimulates these to form the active substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon submitted data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active ingredient structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study on patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients responded to the medication after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was taken ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non commercial purposes .
in addition , concerns were expressed in such a way that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed cannot be sufficient .
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical study .
after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease ret@@ ali@@ ated in more patients than with the reference medicine ; moreover , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from this , the test used in the study to determine whether the drug is immune to an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , is not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be applied to the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection accompanied by cru@@ stal formation ) and small infected Laz@@ er@@ ations ( bite or cutting ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go is not to be used to treat infections that have been prov@@ able or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ ine @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go may not work against this type of infection .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 the surface area to be treated should not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bit the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection had been cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5,@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients under placebo rated the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin patients , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were considered together in Hau@@ tw@@ unden , about 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go is not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( stained cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or infections that have been prov@@ ably or probably caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation to the order .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go out@@ weigh the risks during the short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ firm@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Ltd to the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd. for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and considered alternative therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the event of raising awareness or serious local irrit@@ ation by applying Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment is to be abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully wi@@ pes away and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection will begin .
retin@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gens or is suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials of un@@ infected open wounds , Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was in@@ sufficiently effective in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
an alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected body occurs after 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of retin@@ ulin and other topical means on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other topical drugs is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after topical application on sk@@ imp@@ y skin or infected superficial wounds , clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not to be expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After the same oral administration of 2 times a day 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , the medium Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin E@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x increased by 81 % after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on sk@@ imm@@ ed skin of healthy adult men .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dosage adjustments are not considered necessary if topical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are inadequate with regard to a statement on the impact on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see paragraph 5.3 ) .
the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy if topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of a systemic antibiotic .
in deciding whether the breast@@ feeding continues / ended or the treatment with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / terminated , it is necessary to weigh between the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the infant and the benefits of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go surgery , the most commonly reported side effect irrit@@ ation was at the location , which concerned about 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated due to fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ er@@ anus ( formerly P@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the active mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ B@@ ind@@ ungs@@ stelle and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase center .
by binding to this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pe@@ p@@ tide transfer , blocking partially P @-@ binding inter@@ actions and prevents the normal creation of active 50 ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
should the use of retin@@ ulin appear obj@@ ection@@ able due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance in at least some infectious forms , a consultation should be aimed at by experts .
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin opposite S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of non @-@ response to the treatment with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of strains with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
resor@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and on sc@@ ented skin for up to 7 days .
in 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice a day for 5 days of topical treatment of secon@@ dar@@ ily infected trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
samples were taken on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic inclusion in humans after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 of scre@@ ed skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with little involvement of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes .
in @-@ vitro examination on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test , or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes as well as in rats micro@@ nucleus testing for in @-@ vi@@ vo examination of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there were neither male nor female rats signs of limited fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which was achieved up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 sc@@ ented skin ) :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study of rats at oral dos@@ ages ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to ≥ 3 @-@ times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development sto@@ ic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity were established .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a two dose vacc@@ ination plan , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may be achieved only after the second dose is given . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , ambition can only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection while imm@@ uni@@ zation and ensuring that the vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses can end .
if a catch @-@ up dose is desirable against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; vacc@@ ines work by assisting the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural defence ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how it can defend itself against a disease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alien &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and generates antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as the vacc@@ ination &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Twin@@ et Ad@@ ul@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which has been approved since 1996 and the vaccine that has been approved since 1997 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but in the context of a three @-@ dose vacc@@ ination plan , Twin@@ rix adults and children will be given children .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ et adult were also used as evidence of the use of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection .
in an additional 20@@ 8 children study , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix led between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection to develop protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection from Ambi@@ rix was similar in a six month and a 12 month gap between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection site , redness , mat@@ ur@@ ation ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may react hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals to the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals .
the standard vacc@@ ination plan with ambition is made up of two doses , the first dose is given at the time of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose is given .
if a blu@@ ep@@ rint can be vacc@@ inated both for H@@ CV and Hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination vaccine .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibody levels observed in the same magnitude as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not fully assured that immuno@@ competent individuals who have responded to hepatitis vacc@@ ination require a vacc@@ ination , since they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory with no longer det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the application of the vaccine .
if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardization diet is recommended with the combination vaccine , which contains 360 ELISA units of the form @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s @-@ antibody @-@ value is achieved after the pri@@ ming @-@ uni@@ zation , so that in these cases the gift of further vacc@@ ines may be necessary .
as an intra@@ muscular injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could lead to a sub@@ optimal impact , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
in the case of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disturbances , however , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ ally as an exception as in these cases there can be ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge after intra@@ muscular administration .
if ambient rix in the second year of life was given in the form of a separate injection simultaneously with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ ite , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it must be assumed that there is no adequate immune response .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this wor@@ ding in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ ation , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier Thi@@ om@@ yr and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation .
in clinical trials 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were given to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ dose drop @-@ down vaccine .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ ur@@ ation based on a calculation basis per vaccine dose of Ambi@@ rix , but not on a basis of comp@@ utation per person .
pain was observed after the dose of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of subjects , compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % of subjects after the dose of the 3 @-@ dose @-@ combination vaccine .
according to the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had received Ambi@@ rix had pain , compared to 6@@ 3,@@ 8 % among the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose @-@ combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ur@@ ation was comparable per pro@@ band ( i.e. about the entire vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of subjects who received Ambi@@ rix compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects who received the 3 @-@ dose @-@ combination vaccine ) .
the frequency of pronounced pain and mat@@ ur@@ ation was small and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a comparative study with 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ Group was comparable to that observed in ad@@ minist@@ ering with the 3 @-@ dose @-@ combination vaccine with 360 ELISA @-@ units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ old , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the share of vacc@@ ines reported via severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted in vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years , the rate of ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V was 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the non @-@ HB@@ s ser@@ o@@ conversion rates were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted between 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combin@@ ation@@ vaccine in three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was de@@ preci@@ ated , the rate of ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 was significantly higher compared with Ambi@@ rix in the month 2 and 6 after administration of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine .
the immune responses received in a clinical comparative study at 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after the complete vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. , in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ ines either received a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with ambient rix or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in people who were between 12 and 15 years of age , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected over at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ months vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immune response observed in this study against both anti@@ gens was comparable to that after vacc@@ ination of 3 cans with a combination vaccine , consisting of 360 ELISA units of form @-@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study involving 12@@ - to and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds it was shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies can be compared 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme compared to that in the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was administered simultaneously with the fresh@@ ening chim@@ er@@ om@@ ination of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ ite , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar levels of ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates as for earlier formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing by eye for possible foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .
according to article 114 of Directive 2001 / 83 / EC amended version , the state batch release is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorized for this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted via viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as by bathing in waters contaminated by sewage .
you may feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may require a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not fully protect against infection with Hepatitis A@@ - or Hepatitis B Virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child is already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both imm@@ ac@@ ulate boxes ( although your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of the vacc@@ ination ) vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
preventing other infections caused by the liver or causing symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any ingredient of this vaccine , including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can manifest through it@@ chy skin erup@@ tions , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you / your child already has an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B .
• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usual administration of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , it will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccine dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced levels of effective ingredients is usually given one month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vaccine against the end of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected by persons suffering from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your body &apos;s immune system or if you / your child undergoing a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child are taking other medicines ( including those you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child has been vacc@@ inated / has received / has received / has received / has been planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine has to be given simultaneously with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different limbs as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nonetheless be sufficient .
usually , pregnant women or breast@@ feeding women are not given , unless they are urgently vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B .
important information about certain other ingredients of Ambi@@ rix please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 mixed cans ) : • pain or discomfort at the spot or redness • Mat@@ te • irrit@@ ability • headache • lack of appetite
♦ frequent ( up to 1 case per 10 inj@@ ected cans ) : • swelling at the injection point • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • di@@ zz@@ iness • gastro@@ intestinal complaints
further side effects , the days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 treated doses ) have been reported :
these include locally restricted or extended set@@ backs , which can be it@@ ching or ves@@ ical , swelling of the eye and face , ap@@ plau@@ ding breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden loss of blood pressure and un@@ consciousness .

23 Inform@@ ing your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will affect you / your child significantly or you notice any side effects not stated in this package .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data that has become known since the initial approval for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP believes that the benefit @-@ risk relationship for the rix remains positive .
however , as Ambi@@ rix was only launched in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposure .
ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients aged over a month with an incomplete enzyme defect or hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in the pre@@ history .
ammon@@ ites - split into several single doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered via a gastro@@ stom@@ y ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach @-@ leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach @-@ leading tube ) .
it was not a comparative study because Am@@ mon@@ ites could not be compared to a different treatment or placebo ( a placebo treatment , i.e. without active substance ) .
am@@ on@@ aps may also cause loss of appetite , abnormal aci@@ dity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , fla@@ vor@@ ing , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor , or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that am@@ on@@ aps in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevent high ammon@@ ia levels .
Am@@ mon@@ gst has been approved under exceptional circumstances due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information to this drug .
the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete deficiency of enzyme has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of living ) .
in patients with a bel@@ ated form ( complete enzyme defect that mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first months of life ) there is an indication for the use if a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy consists in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with hi@@ cc@@ ups , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ule form .
the daily dose is calculated individually considering protein intoler@@ ance and the daily protein intake needed for growth and the development of the patient &apos;s daily protein intake .
according to previous clinical experiences , the regular daily dose of sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults .
for patients suffering from an early mani@@ f@@ al deficiency of car@@ am@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine trans@@ lu@@ or@@ o@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ inate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing because there is a risk for the development of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cers if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
each AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablet contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , respectively 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium each 20 g sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma .
since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate over the liver and kidneys takes place , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be applied with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results in pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in young rats at high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) it came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal proliferation and increased neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functional nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in humans into breast milk , and for this reason , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least one adverse event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events assumed that they were not connected to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year @-@ old abnormal female patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in connection with lac@@ tat@@ azi@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , corneal top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of an over@@ dose happened in a 5 month old infant with an accidental individual dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intraven@@ ous doses up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abo@@ lically active compound , which is formed by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine into phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 Pati@@ ents with disturbances of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for each gram , the sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is started immediately in order to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
the pre@@ diction of the early mani@@ f@@ al form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ au@@ st , and the disease itself led to death in the course of treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free an@@ alogues within the first year of life .
hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative channels of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced food and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns in post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first month of life ) to 80 % .
patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which had already been treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy was 100 % survival rate , but even in these patients it was time for many with mental disabilities or other neurological defic@@ its .
in patients with a late mani@@ f@@ al form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ ic form of the or@@ ni@@ thine trans@@ lu@@ or@@ o@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which recovered from a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated permanently with sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a protein @-@ reduced diet , survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neurological defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible even in the treatment and in some patients another deterioration of the neurological condition may occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is consumed enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine in the liver and kidney , where phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine arises .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined after an individual dose of 5 g sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in so@@ ber @-@ healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the liver after individual surrender as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients following IV administration of sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an or@@ ally single dose of 5 g sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were found 15 minutes after taking .
in the majority of patients suffering from ure@@ a cycli@@ c disorders or hem@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was det@@ ectable in the next morning no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were treated repeatedly with sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat had no pla@@ sty effects with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( study 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules are either taken or@@ ally ( babies and children who do not have to swallow tablets , or patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing ) or via a gastro@@ stom@@ y paras@@ ite or a nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experiences , the regular daily dose of sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults .
the concentration of am@@ moni@@ ac , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
for patients suffering from an early mani@@ f@@ al deficiency of car@@ am@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine trans@@ lu@@ or@@ o@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contain 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat @-@ fl@@ utes were exposed before the birth phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , lesi@@ ons in the pyramid cells of the brain cor@@ tex occurred .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year @-@ old abnormal female patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in connection with lac@@ tat@@ azi@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , corneal top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle it can be assumed that for each gram , the sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
already existing neurological defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible even in the treatment , and in some patients another deterioration of the neurological condition may occur .
after an or@@ ally individual dose of 5 g sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ular form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were found 15 minutes after taking .
during the dur@@ ance of durability , the patient can keep the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature not exceeding 25 ° C .
in this procedure , the small measuring spoon contains 0.@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8,6 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient has to receive the drug through a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS may also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accumulate in the body after consuming proteins .
if laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can influence the results of certain laboratory studies .
if you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have it recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs .
you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during breast@@ feeding , as the drug may pass into breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases confusion , head@@ aches , fla@@ vor@@ ing disorders , re@@ plac@@ ements of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disrup@@ tions and deterioration of existing neurological conditions have also been observed .
if you notice one of these symptoms , contact your doctor or the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating appropriate treatment .
if you forgot the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

angi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute coron@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( AC@@ S , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example with unstable Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) ( an abnormal measured value for electro@@ cardi@@ ogra@@ m or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients undergoing a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help in patients suffering from ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study of AC@@ S treatment in which the effect of angi@@ ox was compared with a certain dose or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another medicine for the prevention of blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
during the PCI , the patient was often a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) and additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots like Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab und A@@ spir@@ in .
in the treatment of AC@@ S , angi@@ ox - with or without the administration of G@@ PI - was as effective in the prevention of new events ( death cases , heart attacks or re@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or one year as much as conventional treatment .
in patients who underwent a PCI , angi@@ ox in relation to all indicators was as effective as he@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ox may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din , other hi@@ sto@@ dine , or any of the other components .
it may also not be used in patients who recently had hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that , during the treatment of AC@@ S and during a PCI , angi@@ ox is a acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd for the marketing of angi@@ ox across the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( unstable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST leverage attacks ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of an emergency attack or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an IV dose of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if the patient subsequently fails to use a PCI , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately before the procedure , a bolt will be given of 0.5 mg / kg , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation .
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial IV dose of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and an intraven@@ ous IV in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a single type of bol@@ us of angi@@ ox was not studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place .
in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicinal product should be carefully mixed before the application and the doses should be administered intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate ren@@ al function restriction ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subject to a PCI ( whether treated with a bi@@ vali@@ ant against AC@@ S or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is below 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose must be checked again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to authorisation , the ACT value was 5 minutes after administration of the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox may be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tional he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active agent or any other component or against hi@@ sto@@ dine . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients must be carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even if in case of PCI @-@ patients under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din most ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges occur at arter@@ ial pun@@ cture points , in patients who undergo a per@@ kut@@ ane coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , bleeding can occur in principle everywhere .
in patients receiving war@@ far@@ in and being treated with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din is again achieved before treatment .
based on the knowledge of the active mechanism of anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tic or thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ators ) , it can be assumed that these drugs increase the risk of bleeding .
in combination with thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ators or anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants , clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters can be monitored regularly in each case .
in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , de@@ binding or post@@ nat@@ al development are inadequate ( see Section 5.3 ) .

both in the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women as well as in patients over 65 years of age more frequently came to un@@ desirable events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding has been defined according to the A@@ cu@@ ity and Tim@@ i standards for heavy ble@@ ed@@ ings as in table 2 foot@@ notes .
both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an A@@ cu@@ ity @-@ severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ orbit@@ al , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or bleeding in the point area requiring radi@@ ological or surgical intervention , reduction of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with a known hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , re@@ operation due to bleeding , use of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed loc@@ aliz@@ ations , which occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; punc@@ tures , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck .
the following information on side effects is based on data from a clinical study with a bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women as well as in patients over 65 years of age more frequently came to un@@ desirable events than in male or younger patients .
both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported in practice after a comprehensive application and are grouped according to system organ@@ osi@@ ties in table 6 .
in case of over@@ dosing , the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din is immediately to be terminated and the patient is closely monitored with regard to signs of bleeding .
angi@@ ox contains Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a direct and specific thro@@ m@@ bin@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both to the cataly@@ tic center and the ani@@ on @-@ binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether thro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or at cl@@ ots .
the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din to thro@@ mb@@ in , and therefore its effect , is rever@@ sible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in on its part spl@@ its the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , serum was unable to indu@@ ce thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) .
in healthy volunteers and in patients Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti @-@ coag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is evi@@ den@@ ced by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was carried out with the patients below , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in arm A of the A@@ cu@@ ity trial , un@@ frac@@ tional He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with unstable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST mid@@ point inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to receive a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or at the beginning of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or PCI .
in the A@@ cu@@ ity study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients requiring a angi@@ ography within 72 hours were spread evenly across the 3 treatment arms .
about 77 % of patients had a recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and approximately 99 % of all patients underwent surgery within 72 hours of a angi@@ ography .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from 6 years onwards with diabetes that require insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to control glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin can not work effectively .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from human insulin , and the change means that it acts faster and has a shorter duration than a short @-@ acting insulin analog .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in Type 2 diabetes , where insulin is unable to work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator for efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was noticed in comparison to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % at insulin incub@@ ation .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % in normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine or any of the other ingredients , or in patients suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose level .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied either in the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the delta muscle or to apply sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection into the area of the abdominal wall by continuous in@@ fusion .
due to the reduced glu@@ co@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism , insulin requirements in patients with a restriction of liver function can be reduced .
any change of the effectiveness , the brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ ret@@ ar@@ ded etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or manufacturing method can result in a change in insulin demand .
3 An insufficient dosage or breakdown of a treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ requiring diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and a diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life threatening .
the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or an insulin of another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may require a change in the dosage .
the time of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia re@@ occurrence depends on the actual profile of the used insulin and can therefore change when changing the treatment scheme .
substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia belong to oral anti@@ diabe@@ tic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ y@@ rami@@ de , fi@@ br@@ ate , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , sal@@ ox@@ et@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ oly@@ tics such as beta @-@ block@@ ers , cl@@ oning , gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and reserves , the symptoms of the adren@@ aline counter @-@ regulation can be weakened or absent .
experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see paragraph 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in enters into human breast milk , but generally insulin does not interfere with breast milk , nor is it resor@@ bed to oral use .
following are listed in clinical trials known un@@ desirable drug @-@ cur@@ es , grouped by system organ@@ ites and sorted by decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very frequently ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; not known ( frequency based on the available data cannot be estimated ) .
cold sweat , cool and pale skin , ti@@ redness , nerv@@ ousness or trem@@ ors , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , lack of concentration , di@@ zz@@ iness , excessive dog , headache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
Li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy If it fails to continuously change the injection location within the injection range , a Li@@ po@@ di@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy can occur at the injection site .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia associated with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given by a appropriately trained person , or by an intraven@@ ous administration of glucose by a doctor .
after a glu@@ c@@ tional injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral blood glucose ( especially through skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) and by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ it of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the response occurs faster and the operation time is shorter than with hu@@ br@@ is normal insulin .
in a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 with Type 1 Diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus , insulin sensitivity in the therapeutic dosage range from 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a proportional glu@@ cos@@ al effect , and at 0.3 e / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ al effect , just like human insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast response as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ al effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
the data showed that in an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a similar post @-@ pran@@ dial gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved as with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in was turned 2 minutes before the meal , a better post @-@ pran@@ dial control than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal , was achieved .
if insulin is turned 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , such as human normal insulin , which is given 2 times before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in for 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal compared to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in the gift of 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - after ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human nor@@ - mal@@ aria , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
