<seg id="1">The present document is a summary of the European Public Health Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has evaluated the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your disease or treatment, please read the package insert (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you would like more information on the basis of CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as a 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg of melting tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth) as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. Through thinking and speaking, hallucinations (listening or seeing things that are not present), mistrust and delusion; • Bipolar I disturbance, a mental illness, in which patients have multiple episodes (periods of anorexic high-tuning) alternate with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the drug in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick monitoring of increased restlessness or behavioural disturbance if the oral consumption of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be used for inserting or the melting tablets in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are taking other medicines at the same time, which are broken down as well as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells through" "" "neurotransmitters" "", "i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of the neurons amongst themselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole probably acts as a "partial agonist" for receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that aripitizol like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser extent than the neurotransmitters, works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">As dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing its recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent the recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies over a period of up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that suffer from increased unrest over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence in 160 patients in which the manic symptoms were already stabilized using Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from increased unrest, compared with Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in the symptoms of the patients was examined by means of a standard dial for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responding to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to examine how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution to intake it.</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly stronger reduction in the symptoms of increased anxiety than the patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In four of the five short-term studies, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short-term studies.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented the recurrence of manic episodes in previously untreated patients for up to 74 weeks and when administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses also reduced more effectively than placebo to increase the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify for taking (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled staining), thoracic (drowsiness), headache, blurred vision, dyspepsia (drowsiness), drowsiness (increased saliva production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in patients with predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes related to treatment with Aripiprazole prevail over the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the Committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I-disorder, when oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for the transfer of Abilify to the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes related to treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased efficacy of dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not demonstrated, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, independent of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">In consideration of the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 Inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazl dosage should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the onset or after changing an antipsychotic therapy, even in treatment with Aripiprazl (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that there was no increased risk of suicidal risk in patients with bipolar disorder compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, overflow problems), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acterated and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="39">If signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia are observed in a patient treated with Abilify, it should be considered to reduce the dose or to cancel the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate mns, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">This is why aripiprazole should be applied with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with aria prazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients treated with aripiprazole underwent an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there was in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for unwanted cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients treated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents who permit direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly with respect to a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar deficiency due to combination ties, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effects or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of aripitizol on the central nervous system, caution is advisable when aripitizol is used in combination with alcohol or other central potent medications with superimposed side effects such as sedation (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The antagonist famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripiprazl by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dosages should be undertaken.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") Metabolism, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extendable metabolites.</seg>
<seg id="53">If one considers the joint gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4-inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may have similar effects, and similar dosages should be undertaken.</seg>
<seg id="55">After replacing the CYP2D6- or 3A4-inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be increased to the dose height before the adjuvant therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 common with Abilify can be calculated with a moderate increase in aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphine-Ratio), 2C19 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazole) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan to be pregnant during treatment with Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="59">This drug may not be used during pregnancy due to insufficient data security for humans and due to the concerns associated with animal reproductive studies, unless the potential benefits clearly justify the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned about dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are sure that Ariel prazole has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo, or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: common (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasional (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - in a controlled long-term study of over 52 weeks in patients treated with aripiprazole a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, akathisie, Dystonia and dyskinesia occurred compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients treated with Aripiprazl treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 14.8% in patients treated with aripiprazole and 15.1% in patients under Olanzapine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">In a controlled study for 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients under haloperidol-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients treated with aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term follow-up period over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment was 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazl and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes of routinely monitored laboratory parameters showed no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">CPK increases (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with aripiprazole compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">The side effects associated with antipsychotic therapy and their occurrence in the treatment with Aripiprazole include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or deliberate acute overdoses with Aripiprazl alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information on the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with aripiprazole, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of overdosing, since Aripiprazole has a high plasma protein binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of aripitizol in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder via the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazole showed in vitro a high affinity to dopamine D2- and D3 receptor as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D4-, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and to the histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">The positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of the binding of 11C-raloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, on the Nucleus caudatus and at the Putamen.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) at 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement of the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a half-operated study, 52 percent of responder patients who adhered to the study medication were similar in both groups (Aripiprazl 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measuring scales, defined as secondary education goals, including PANSS and the Montgomery Ash-depression-scale, showed a significantly stronger recovery than with Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled trial for 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazl showed a significantly higher decline of the relapse rate, which was 34% in the aripiprazl group and at 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapine-controlled, multinational double blind study for schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target was' weight gain ', a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg) compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dose over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar I disorder, Ariel prazole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and actively controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazole showed a efficacy in week 3 versus placebo, which was comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazole also showed a comparable share of patients with symptomatic remission of mania like lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which partially touched on lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial for 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension period over 74 weeks in manic patients who had remission with Aripiprazl during a stabilization period prior to randomisation, Ariel showed himself superior to placebo with regard to the prevention of a bipolar setback, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxide of Aripiprazole, the N-Dealkyisation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination terminal time is approximately 75 hours for aripiprazole with extensive metastases over CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours with 'bad' (= "poor") metabolites via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In aripiprazl, there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, nor showed gender-dependent effects in a pharmacokinetic investigation of schizophrenic patients.</seg>
<seg id="91">A policy-specific analysis of pharmacokinetic did not indicate clinically significant differences in respect to the ethnicity or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of aripiprazole and dehydrotrozole were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the elimination of liver function on the pharmacokinetic of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not enough to draw conclusions to their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated doses, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, so they have limited or no significance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects comprised a dose-dependent subkidney toxicity (lipofuscin-pigment-accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the middle steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithiasis was established as a result of the precipitation of sulfate-conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazl in the bile duct of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the mean steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16- to 81times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, concentrations found in the human gall at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of the sulphate-conjugate of hydroxy- aripiprazole no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the bile duct, and are well below the limit values (6%) in in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages leading to expositions of 3 and 11-times the mid-steady state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="145">In order to increase the resorption and to minimise variability, an injection is recommended in the M. deltoideus or deep into the Gluteus maximus muscle while circumventing adipous regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acut therapy (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If further oral treatment is indicated with aripiprazole, see the summary of the features of the medicine to Abilify tablets, Abilify's melting tablets or Abilify solution.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no studies on the efficacy of aripitizol injection solutions in patients with asgibility and behavioural disorders caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazl injection solution, patients should be observed with regard to extreme sedation or blood pressure (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Studies on the safety and efficacy of aripitizol injection solution are not available to patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (prescribed by prescribed or illegal medicines).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, overflow problems), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acterated and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of mns are high fever, stiffness, changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating, and heart rhythm disorders).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly with respect to a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar mania due to combination ties, the use of antipsychotics, where weight gain is known as side effects or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the Sedation was greater compared to the after-alone administration of Aripiprazl, in a study, in which healthy volunteers aripiprazl (15 mg dosage) were used as one-off intramuscularly and the simultaneously Lorazepam (2 mg dosage) were intramuscularly received.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The antagonist famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, decreases the absorption rate of aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") Metabolism, in comparison with CYP2D6, extensive metabolites result in a common application with high-acting inhibitors of CYP3A4 to higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- proteaseininhibitors, are likely to have similar effects, and similar dosages should be undertaken.</seg>
<seg id="160">After replacing the CYP2D6- or 3A4-inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be increased to the dose height before the adjuvant therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dosage) were intramuscularly received, the intensity of the sedment was greater compared to the after-alone application of aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following adverse events were more common in clinical trials with Aripiprazl injection solution (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo, or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">107 The following adverse events were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo, or were classified as possible medically relevant side-effects (*) in clinical trials with orally applicable Arias prazole (see Section 5.1):</seg>

<seg id="166">In another study for 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients treated with aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term follow-up period over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazl treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazl and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes of routinely monitored laboratory parameters showed no medically significant differences.</seg>

<seg id="170">The side effects associated with antipsychotic therapy and their occurrence in the treatment with Aripiprazole include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders were the aripitizol injection solution with statistically significant major improvements associated with placebo and was similar to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as detoxicity and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazole injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms of asgibility and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- Reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The mean improvement from the initial value on the PANSS Excitement Component score with the primary 2-hour end point was 5,8 for Placebo, 9,6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe atgitis, a similar efficacy was observed regarding the overall population, but a statistical significance could be determined due to decreased number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) at 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazl (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement of the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a half-operated study, 52 percent of responder patients who adhered to the study medication were similar in both groups (Aripiprazl 77% (oral) and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measuring scales, defined as secondary education goals, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rate, showed a significantly stronger recovery than with Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled trial for 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole (oral) showed a significantly higher decline of the relapse rate, which was 34% in the aripiprazol- (oral) group and at 57% in placebo.</seg>

<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which in part lasted over 2 weeks did not show any superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled trial for 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study extension in manic patients who had remission with Aripiprazl during a stabilization period prior to randomisation, Ariel showed himself superior to placebo with regard to the prevention of a bipolar setback, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">In the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection, the Aripiprazl AUC is 90% larger the AUC after administration of the same dose as a tablet; the systemic exposure was similar to the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers, the average time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The administration of Aripiprazole injection solution was tolerated well by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated application in a systemic exposure (AUC), respectively, respectively 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="185">Studies on the reproductive toxicity after IV application showed no safety-relevant concerns after maternal exposure, which was 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with aripiprazole (oral) for safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated doses, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans; this means that they have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects encompassed a dose-dependent subkidney toxicity (lipofuscin-pigment-accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10-times the medium steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, a cholelithiasis was established as a result of the precipitation of sulfate-conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazl in the bile duct of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the average steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16- to 81-times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, of which about three quarters of which had previously received an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in any application or as monotherapy) was compared with the drug containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">In the main study, 72 (31%) of 229 patients treated with Abraxane responded to the treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of 225 patients who received conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">If only the patients who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference between the medicines in terms of efficacy indicators such as time to worsening of the disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">In contrast, patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may also not be used in patients who have low neutrophils in the blood before treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) found that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel and that in contrast to other drugs containing paclitaxel, it was not necessary to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Abraxis Bio-Science Limited for the marketing of Abraxane in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anthracycline-containing therapy is not indicated (see also Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophils &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensoric neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In sensoric neuropathy grade 3 the treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is achieved to degree 1 or 2, and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced.</seg>

<seg id="279">No studies were conducted with patients with impaired kidney function and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dosage adjustments in patients with kidney function impairment (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="280">Abraxane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 because of not sufficient data for harmlessness and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="281">Abraxane is an albumin-bound nanoparticular formulation of paclitaxel, which could significantly other pharmacological features than other formulation of paclitaxel (see Section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should be immediately removed and a symptomatic treatment should be initiated and the patient must not be treated with paclitaxel again.</seg>
<seg id="283">In patients no renewed Abraxane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neutrophene number is increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thrombocyte count rises again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver dysfunctions (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">While a kardiotoxicity associated with Abraxane has not been proven, cardiac outages in the indicated patient population are not unusual, especially in patients with previous anthracycline treatment or underlying heart or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">If, after the administration of Abraxane is nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, these can be treated with the usual antiemetic and constipating agents.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used in pregnant women or at childbearing age who do not have effective contraception, except treatment of the mother with paclitaxel is unavoidable.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should use Abraxane a reliable method of contraception during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients who are treated with Abraxane are advised to not bear a child up to six months after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised of a sperm reservation before the treatment, because the treatment with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as fatigue (very often) and dizziness (often) which can affect the airtightness and the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events reported in 229 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma who were treated in the pivotal phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most noticeable important hematological toxicity (79% of patients reported) and was fast reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anaemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 shows the side effects associated with the administration of Abraxane as monotherapy in each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate hydrogenase in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphor in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, flatulence, tongue burning, dry mouth, pain in the gums, loose stools, oesophagitis, soreness in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of muscles, headaches, abdominal pain, muscular spasms, pain in skeletal muscles, flank pain, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakness, very common:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive in relation to a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">As these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no causal connection with these events has been established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an Atimikrotubules active ingredient that promotes the storage of microtubules from the tubular indices and stabilizes microtubules by inhibiting their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization results in an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin conveys the transcytosis of plasma components into endothelial cells and in the course of in-vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is believed that this improved transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60-albuminrezepte and due to the albuminal Proteins SPARC (revisted protein acidic rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation occurs in the area of the tumor.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two approved non-affiliated studies and 454 patients treated in a randomised Phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In one study, 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion of more than 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion of 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicenter trial was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received paclitaxel in patients with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in the form of solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with predictive medication (N = 229) or in form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had a impaired general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastatic lesions.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had not received chemotherapy before, 27% had only adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastasation and 19% because of metastatic disease and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for overall response rate and time to progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First-Line treatment are outlined below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared with paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced peripheral neuropathy grade 3 at a time during the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy for waste on baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetic of the overall paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">Exposure to active ingredients (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 According to IV dose of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration declined in a multiphase manner.</seg>
<seg id="318">The mean distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume indicates far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or soft tissue connection of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study involving patients with advanced solid tumours the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared to intravenous 30 mg / m2 Abraxane with values following a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">Paclitaxel was higher (43%) following the Abraxane administration (43%) compared with a solvent containing paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers, paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α -hydroxylitaxel and two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxylitaxel and 6α -3" -p-diihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">Following a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative uric elimination of the unchanged active ingredient was 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxylitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, indicating a far-reaching non-renal Clearance.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data are available for patients aged over 75 years since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">Chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and protected from light light over 8 hours.</seg>
<seg id="325">Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anticarcinogenic medicine and, like other potentially toxic substances, should be treated with caution when handling Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="326">Using a sterile syringe, over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride infusion solution is injected into a Abraxane gas bottle.</seg>
<seg id="327">After complete encore of the solution, the water bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wetting of the solid.</seg>
<seg id="328">Then the water bottle should be swivelled and / or inverted for at least 2 minutes and / or inverted until a complete suspension of the powder is made.</seg>
<seg id="329">If precipitations or sinks are visible, the water-through bottle must be inverted softly in order to achieve a complete resuspension before application.</seg>

<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood spends, Abysamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be carried out by the patient or his caregiver, provided that they have received appropriate instructions.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the haemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients are to be controlled prior to treatment in order to ensure that there is no iron deficiency and iron supplements should be given throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia can be caused by erythropoietal deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and to reduce the consequences of a loss of blood.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) is introduced which enables it to form epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">In the course of a major study involving 479 patients suffering from kidney problems, Abysamed was compared with the reference drug.</seg>
<seg id="370">For all patients participating in this study, Eprex / Erypo was injected into a vein at least eight weeks before they were either converted to streamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator for efficacy was the change in haemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also submitted the results of a study in which the effects of dissecamed under the skin were examined with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from kidney problems, the hemoglobin values of patients who were amed for dissecamed were maintained to the same extent as those patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, the patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abysamed is a rise in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, stinging migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">It may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Streamed as injections under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that no allergic reactions are triggered.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that it was approved in accordance with the European Union regulations that the drug has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that is making Useamed will provide information packages to healthcare professionals in all Member States, including information on the safety of the medicine.</seg>

<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphomas or multiple myeloma who receive chemotherapy, with the risk of transfusion due to the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia in the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">Treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate anaemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8,1 mmol / l], if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, for planned larger operative procedures requiring a large volume of blood (4 or more blood in women; 5 or more blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">In addition to the reduction of foreign blood, Abseamed can be used before a large elective orthopaedic surgery in adults with no iron deficiency, in which high risk of transfusion complications is expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml may not be applied to an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l) except for paediatric patients, in which the hemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms of anemia and disease may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease burden; therefore, the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition condition is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in haemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values over or below the hemoglobin target concentration can occasionally be observed in one patient.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to reach the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value rises by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent haemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l), the epoetin alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose which is required for the control of anaemia and anemia.</seg>
<seg id="392">The clinical results suggest that patients with initially low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The clinical results suggest that patients with initially low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4,25 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week by intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should be done in increments of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms of anemia and follow-up may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease burden; therefore, the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition condition is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="396">In view of this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to reach the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose which is required for the control of the anemia.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 weeks of haemoglobin value is increased by at least 1 g / dl (0,62 mmol / l) or the reticular number of ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose of 150 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin increase is &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the reproduction rate of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl is increased compared to the initial value, the dose should be increased to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If there is ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) three times a week after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.U. / kg (≥ 0,62 mmol / l), the dose of 300 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">On the other hand, the haemoglobin value of &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) or the binary number of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl is increased compared to the baseline value, an attack on epoetin-alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anemia (hematokrit 33 - 39%), in which the precautionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood cannulae is required, should be received twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">Iron substitution should start as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the start of the autologous blood donation programme, so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the screening therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg epoetin alfa, which should be given once a week for three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should be preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg every 10 consecutive days, on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis through the hose of a fistula needle, followed by 10 ml isotonic saline solution to flush the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug into circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients suffering from treatment with any erythropoetin (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive a dissecamed or another erythropoetin (see Section 4.4 - erythroblastoenie).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within a month before treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis (e.g. anamnestically known venous thromboembolia).</seg>
<seg id="409">The use of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in patients suffering from a larger elective orthopaedic surgery: severe coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial occlusion, vascular disease of caricular or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with a recent cardiac infarction or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastoenia (PRCA) Very rarely has been reported on the occurrence of an anti-body mediated PRCA after months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of active haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the check hole value should be determined and the usual causes of non-response should be investigated (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium toxication, infections or infections, blood loss and hemolysis).</seg>
<seg id="412">If the erythropoetin index, taking into account anaemia (i.e. the erythropoetin index), is reduced (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 0.5%), the thrombocyte and leukocyte numbers are normal, and if no other cause of loss of action is found, the anti-erythropoetin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone marrow should be considered for the diagnosis of a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of Abysamed in patients with a risk for an anti-body-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, the upper limit of the hemoglobin target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials, increased mortality risk and risk for severe cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a haemoglobin concentration of over 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical trials have shown no significant benefit due to the administration of epoetin, if the hemoglobin concentration is increased via the concentration required for the control of the anemia and the prevention of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinical evidative coronary heart disease or congestive insufficiency, the upper limit of the hemoglobin target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anaemia associated with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are not yet dialysis, will not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">In the case of tumour patients under chemotherapy, a 2 - 3-week delay between epoetin alfa and erythropoetin response should be taken into account (patients who may need to be transacted).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase exceeds 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) a month or a hb value of 13 g / dl (8,1 mmol / l) is exceeded, the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see Section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapic anaemia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the haemoglobin value of 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment involving the involvement of the respective patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients foreseen for a larger elective orthopaedic surgery, the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated accordingly before beginning of epoetin-alfa treatment.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing a larger elective orthopaedic surgery should receive appropriate thrombosis prophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be ruled out that in treatment with epoetin alfa for patients with an initial macular value of &gt; 13 g / dl, there is an increased risk of post-operative thrombotic / vascular events.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled trials, epoetin did not prove that they could improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anaemia or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in people with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy, if haemoglobin target concentration was target from 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l)</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood level of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporin dose should be adapted to the rising haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In-vitro studies on tumor tissues, there is no interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF in terms of hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">About thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular events (cerebral thrombosis, cerebral thrombosis, pulmonary thromboses, pulmonary thromboses, pulmonary thromboses, pulmonary thromboses, pulmonary thromboses, pulmonary thromboses, pulmonary thromboses, pulmonary thrombosis, pulmonary thrombosis, pulmonary thrombosis, pulmonary thrombosis, retinal thromboses and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients suffering from epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent rise in blood pressure or deterioration of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascular events (see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients treated with erythropoetines.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of erythropoetin treatment, surgical patients with cardiovascular disease can result in repeated blood donations to thrombotic and vascular complications.</seg>
<seg id="434">Epoetin alfa, derived from genetic engineering, is glycosiated with respect to the amino acids and the carbohydrate content equivalent to the endogenous human erythropoetin, isolated from the urine of anaemia patients.</seg>

<seg id="576">The main indicator of efficacy was whether the content of the alkaline phosphatase in the serum (an enzyme that decomposes bone substance) returned to normal in the blood or decreased at least 75% compared to the baseline.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women, the risk of spinal fractures was reduced by 70% in people under Aclacsta (excluding other osteoporosis medicines) over a period of three years compared to the placebo.</seg>
<seg id="578">The risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41% compared to all patients under Aclacsta (with or without osteoporosis treatment).</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study with men and women with hip fracture 9% of patients under Aclacsta had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of the patients under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most aclasta side effects occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">It may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive to zoledronic acid or any other bisphosphonate or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients with aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to the infusion site and osteonecone (death of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The manufacturer of Accredista provides instruction material for physicians who prescribe Accredista for the treatment of osteoporosis, as well as a similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="584">In April 2005, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Novartis Europharm Limited for the transport of Accredista throughout the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="587">The patient information package is to be provided and the following core messages include: • The packaging side • contraindication in pregnancy and nursing women • Required for adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non-smoking and a healthy diet • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When medical or nursing assistance is to be taken back</seg>
<seg id="588">Treating osteoporosis • in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including in patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, an intravenous infusion of 5 mg Accredista is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, the administration of the infusion of acetone is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip fracture (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclaccia should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After a treatment by the Morbus Paget with Aclacsta a long remission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient calcium intake in patients with Paget twice daily for at least 500 mg of elemental calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of acetavista (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic hip fracture an initial dose of 50,000 to 125.000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Aclactation infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days of the administration of acetamol may be reduced by administration of acetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of acetone.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney function impairment (see section 4.4) In patients with a creatinine-clearing &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclacsta is not recommended, since limited clinical experience is available for this group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="597">Older patients (≥ 65 years) A dose adjustment is not necessary since the bioavailability, distribution and elimination in older patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and young people Aclacsta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 because data are missing for safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe renal insufficiency (Creatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min), since only limited clinical experience exists for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Before the start of the therapy, an existing hypokalemia is treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid deployment of the effect of Zoledronic acid on bone reconstruction, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia can develop, whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days following the infusion of Aclacsta (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable in patients with Morbus Paget a sufficient intake of calcium, corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of elemental calcium, to ensure at least 10 days of the administration of acetavista (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene) should be considered before an application of bisphosphonates with appropriate preventive dental treatment.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are no data available to patients requiring dental intervention, whether the interruption of treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteonecrosis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days of administration of aclasta can be reduced by administration of acetamol or ibuprofen shortly after using aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of severe adverse events reported by atrial fibrillation was increased in patients receiving aclasta (1,3%) (51 of 3,862) compared to patients receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In the osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial), the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclacsta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), frequent (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Renal dysfunction Zoledronic acid has been associated with renal function disorders that have been associated with renal function (i.e. an increase in serum creatinins) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">Changes in the creation of Creatinine Clearance (measured per year prior to administration) and the appearance of kidney failure as well as limited kidney function were in a clinical study for osteoporosis over three years comparable to the placebo group and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatinins within 10 days after administration was observed at 1.8% of patients treated with aclasta versus 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium levels (less than 2.10 mmol / l) were present in 2.3% of patients treated with Accredista in a large clinical study compared to 21% of patients treated with Accredista in the Morbus Paget studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received supplemental doses of vitamin D and calcium in the postmenopausal osteoporosis study in the study to prevent clinical fractures following a hip fracture and in the Morbus Paget studies (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to prevent clinical fractures after a recently suffered hip fracture, the vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of acetone (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions after administration of Zoledronic acid in a large clinical trial were reported on local reactions to the infusion site such as redness, swelling and / or pain reported (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonectrosis in the jaws area, especially in cancer patients, is reported via osteonecrosis (primarily in the jaw area) that have been treated with bisphosphonates, including Zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomelitis, and the majority of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervention.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 patients with 7,736 patients showed Osteonekrose in the jaw area at a patient treated with placebo and a placebo treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the case of overdosing, which leads to clinically relevant hypokalemia, a compensation can be achieved by adding oral calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical efficacy in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 successive years was indicated in postmenopausal women (7,736 females between 65 and 89 years) with either a BMD-T-Score for the femoral neck ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometrical vertebral fractures was significantly reduced over a period of three years and the frequency of one or more new vertebral fractures after one year (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Patients aged 75 and older had a 60% reduced risk of vertebral fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Accredista showed an unchanged effect over three years, resulting in a 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%) reduced risk of hip fractures.</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Accredista increased bone density on lumbar spine, hip and distal radius compared to placebo treatment at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increases bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the total hip by 6.0%, the femoral neck by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology In 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70), bone biopsies were taken out of the pool a year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase in the trabeculular bone volume and the preservation of the trabeculular bone architecture in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone turnover markers The bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal propeptide of the type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C-Telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients during periods of study.</seg>
<seg id="630">The treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Aclacsta reduced significantly by 30% after 12 months compared to baseline and was kept at 28% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125.000 I.U. orally or intramuscular) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">Total mortgality was 10% (101 patients) in the placebo treated group, compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON RFT study, the Aclacstic treatment increased BMD on the overall thigh and the femoral neck compared to placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="636">More than 24 months compared to placebo, the Aclacsta treatment led to an increase in BMD by 5.4% at the overall level and 4.3% compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON-RFT study, 508 men were randomised and in 185 patients the BMD was evaluated after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a decrease in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in Acservista-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (Study CZOL446M2308), the once yearly administration of Accredista in comparison to the once weekly administration of alendronate was not inferior to the percentage change of the lumbar vertebrae BMD after 24 months compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the treatment at the Paget of the Knochen Aclacsta was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radiologically verified, above all mild to moderately severe disease Paget of the bone (mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase according to the 2.6x to 3.0fold-specific upper normal value when enrolled in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg of Zoledronic acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of risedronate once daily during 2 months was proved in two six months comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">The combined results showed a similar decrease in pain intensity and effect of pain after 6 months compared to the baseline for Aclacsta and Risedronate.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as Responder at the end of the six-month study could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 eyes treated with Aclacsta and 107 with Risedronate patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response was maintained at 141 of the patients treated with Risedronate at an average duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">Unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg. of Zoledronic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the plasma-key rapidly decreased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 hours, followed by a prolonged period of very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearance of the large cycle with half-life time t ½ α 0.24 and t ½ β 1.87 hours, followed by a long eliminations phase with a terminal elimination period t ½ γ at 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the abovementioned t ½ values) probably represent the rapid resorption in the bones and excretion over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly bonded to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body clearance is 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by sex, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the Zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished clearing of metabolized substances metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes is unlikely, because Zoledronic acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, metabolism-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Specific patient groups (see Section 4.2) The renal Clearance of Zoledronic acid correlated with the Creatinine Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the Creatinine Clearance, and was 84 ± 29 ml / min in the 64 examined patients (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in an easy (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and moderate renal dysfunction down to a creatinine-clearing up to 35 ml / min no dose adaptation of the Zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">As for severe renal dysfunction (Creatinin- clearing &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data are available, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-lethal-acting intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and 0.6 mg / kg body weight in rats.</seg>
<seg id="657">In dogs trials, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC 6x of the recommended human-therapeutic exposure) were administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Sub-chronic and chronic toxicity In trials with intravenous application the renal tolerability of zoledronic acid was determined in rats by dose of 0.6 mg / kg as 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose corresponding to the multiple of the human-therapeutic exposure referring to the AUC, corresponding to the AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated application in accumulated expositions which adequately exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects in other organs including gastrointestinal tract and liver as well as the intravenous injection site occurred.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common finding in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spongiosa in the metaphor of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all the dosages, a finding that reflects the pharmacological, anti-absorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats observed teratogenicity at doses of 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner (visceral) abnormalities and such a skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although the maternal toxicity was imprinted at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of low serum calcium levels.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledronic acid is a substance class that is called bisphosphonate and is used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and the disease Paget of the bone.</seg>
<seg id="672">Declining blood levels of sex hormones, especially estrogens, which are made from androgens, play a role in the gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">The bone reconstruction is quickly done with the Paget Morbus, and new bone material is constructed unordered, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta acts by re-normalizing bone reconstruction, ensuring a normal bone formation and gives strength to the bone again.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the general public This document is a summary of the European Public Health Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has evaluated the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (in particular overweight patients) where metformin (a diabetesmedication) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be used in addition to metformin in patients (in particular overweight patients) who cannot be satisfied with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonylic resins or insulin, the previous dose of the sulfonyl resin or insulin can be maintained with the start of the Actos treatment, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of the sulfonyl resin or insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be better utilized and blood sugar levels are reduced, making type 2 diabetes better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Actos in Tripletherapy was studied; the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonylic resin, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos has led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, which makes it possible to reduce blood sugar levels by 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg doses.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the Tripletherapy study, the effect of an additional administration with metformin and a sulfonylic resin in lowering the HbA1c values was 0.94% while the additional dose of placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study in which the combination of Actos and Insulin was studied in 289 patients, the patients receiving Actos additionally increased HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in the patients who additionally took placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events associated with Actos were vision disorders, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypoaesthesia (reduced sensitivity to irritation).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive to pioglitazone or any of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, congestive heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone level - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients with metformin as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited for the marketing of Actos throughout the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and in which metformin is unsuitable due to contraindications or intolerance (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available for the use of Pioglitazon in patients under the age of 18, so the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are endangered by the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. earlier cardiac infarction or symptomatic coronary artery disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, weight gain and edema when Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with Pioglitazon in patients under 75 years of age with type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced advanced macular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in the incidence of congestive heart failure, which, however, did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with elevated output liver enzyme values (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal range) or with other indications of liver disease, Pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT levels are increased to 3-times the limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that point to hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, upper stomach trouble, tiredness, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme values can be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision on whether to continue treatment of the patient with Pioglitazone should be guided by clinical assessment until the laboratory parameters are found.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, a dose-dependent weight gain was detected, which can be obtained from fatty deposits and in some cases linked to fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of hemodilution a minor reduction in the mean haemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and haematokrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred in the treatment with Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4% and hematokrits by 3.6-4.1%) and to a lesser extent in patients under sulfonylic resins and insulin (relative reduction of haemoglobin by 1-2%) and hematokrits by 1-3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive Pioglitazone as oral double- or triple-combination therapy with a sulfonyl resin or as a dual combination therapy with insulin have the risk of dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, a reduction in visual acuity was reported in the treatment of thiazolian indices including pioglitazone, a occurrence or worsening of diabetic macular edema.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but prescribing doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular edema when patients report about disturbances of vision; a suitable ophthalmic diagnosis should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence amounted to 1,9 fractures per 100 patient years for women treated with Pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred in 44 / 870 (5,1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patient years) compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or she enters, the treatment is to be rejected (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the interactions have shown that Pioglitazon has no relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, such as oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a reduction in the AUC of Pioglitazone by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that, under treatment with Pioglitazone, the hyperinsuline emia resulting in pregnancy decreases and increases the availability of metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very frequently &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (not estimable from existing data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turgor and the refractive index of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with Pioglitazone ALT-ascents showed the three times the upper limit of the normal range, however less frequently than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonylic resin.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with advanced Macrovascular disease, the frequency of severe heart failure under Pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than placebo, if Pioglitazone resides.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since its launch, it has rarely been reported about cardiac insufficiency under pioglitazone, but more frequently when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with congestive heart failure.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated in the groups treated with Pioglitazone and over 7,400 patients in the groups treated with comparative medications.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive study over a period of 3.5 years, fractures were treated at 44 / 870 (5.2%) of patients treated with Pioglitazone, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the daily dose of 120 mg / day for four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days, no symptoms appeared.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone appears to be activated via activation of specific nuclear receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator-activated Receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in the animal model.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazone reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral blood glucose level in the case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazone versus Gliclacide as monotherapy was continued for two years to study the time until the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8,0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time of two years after the onset of therapy, blood glucose control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by pioglitazone in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclacide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study of 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was insufficient in spite of three months of optimization with insulin was randomized to pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients suffering from pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin; reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with Pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinine quotients showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinine quotients compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was examined in a small, 18-week investigation of type 2 diabetes patients.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials compared to placebo we observed a reduction in total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol and slightly, but clinically not significantly elevated levels of LDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical studies over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced the total plasma-glycerides and free fatty acids compared with placebo, metformin or gliclacide, and increased HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was observed under Pioglitazone, whereas Metformin and Gliclacide reduced values.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of 20 weeks, Pioglitazone not only reduced the triglyceride level, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride level, both on triglyceride absorption and hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular disease study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced advanced makrovascular disease were randomized in groups who received either Pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to already existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazone is resorbed quickly, whereby the peak concentrations of unmodified Pioglitazone are normally achieved 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV corresponds to the threefold of the efficacy of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, it was demonstrated that Pioglitazone does not have a relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">Simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases or decreases the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After application of radioactively marked pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in the rot (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma elimination period of unmodified Pioglitazone is 5-6 hours in humans, and the total active metabolite is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of Pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with limited kidney function than in healthy volunteers, but the rates of oral Clearance of the mother substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies mice, rats, dogs and monkeys coincided with repeated administration of plasma volume growth with hemodilution, anemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that, under treatment with Pioglitazone, the hyperinsuline emia resulting in the gestation decreases and increases the availability of metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (male and female rats) and tumors (in male rats) of the bladder epithelia have been induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of family adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other Thiazolian indices resulted in increased incidence of colorectal tumors.</seg>

<seg id="824">In ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred in 44 / 870 (5,1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patient years) compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with pioglitazone or gliclacide were examined.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinine quotients showed in Pioglitazone compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone not only reduced the triglyceride level but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride level, which has an effect on Tryglyceride absorption and hepatic trypsis synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study showed the objective of its primary endpoint, which represented a combination of the total mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankle, coronary revascularization and reascularisation of the leg arteries, the results suggest that with the intake of pioglitazone no cardiovascular long-time risks are connected.</seg>

<seg id="872">The injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly, for example by intensified insulin therapy, can perceive hypoglycemia-warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change in strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (fast acting, biphasic, long-acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin analog) and / or manufacturing method (by recombinant DNA opposite insulin-animal origin) may cause a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="875">If a dose adjustment is required when switching to Actrophane in the patient, it may be necessary in the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients with hypoglycaemic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia are less pronounced or different from previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before travelling across several time zones, the patient should be advised to pick up the advice of his physician, as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor must therefore consider possible interactions during therapy and always ask his patients for other medicines taken by them.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 Both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, which may occur in a not sufficiently controlled diabetes therapy, increase the risk of abnormalities and fruit death in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Severe hypoglycemia can lead to unconsciousness and / or seizures and ending with temporary or permanent disorders of the brain function and even death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Disorders of the nervous system Occasionary - Peripheral Neuropathy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with discomfort, which are referred to as acute painful neuropathy and are normally reversible.</seg>
<seg id="882">5 An increase in insulin therapy with abrupt improvement of the blood sugar level can, however, be associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>
<seg id="883">Skin diseases and subcutaneous tissue Actually - Lipoystrophy At the injection site, a Lipoystrophy can be created, if missed, to change the holes within the injection area.</seg>
<seg id="884">General conditions and complaints at the location of the site - Local hypersensitivity reactions at the injection site While insulin therapy allows local hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling, itching, pain and hematoma at the injection site).</seg>
<seg id="885">Diseases of the immune system Occasionary - Urtikaria, Exanthem Very rare - anaphylactic reactions symptoms of generalized hypersensitivity, including generalized rash, itching, sweating, gastrointestinal disorders, angioneurotic edema, breathing difficulties, heart palpitations, low blood pressure and impotence.</seg>
<seg id="886">Hypoglycemia can, however, gradually develop: • Easy hypoglycemia can be treated by the oral supply of glucose and sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should therefore always have grape sugar, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juices. • Serious hypoglycemias with unconsciousness are treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) through a proven help person or given by glucose, which is given intravenously by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect begins within half an hour, the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration of action is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The absorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of spheres of cleavage (hydrolysis) places on the human insulin molecule were considered; none of the metabolites formed by the split is active.</seg>
<seg id="891">Based on conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated doses, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data can no longer identify any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="892">It is recommended - after the Actrophane gas bottle has been removed from the refrigerator - to increase the temperature of the insulin at room temperature (not above 25 ° C) before it is resuspened according to the manual for the first use.</seg>
<seg id="893">Some patients with hypoglycaemic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia are less pronounced or different from previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="894">The doctor must therefore consider possible interactions during therapy and always ask his patients for other medicines taken by them.</seg>

<seg id="896">13 An increase in insulin therapy with abrupt improvement of the blood sugar level can, however, be associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>
<seg id="897">The terminale half-life time (t ½) is therefore rather a measure of resorption as a measure of elimination per se of the insulin from the plasma (insulin has a t ½ of a few minutes in the blood circulation).</seg>

<seg id="1177">The most common side effects of Adenoic (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headaches, diarrhea, nausea (nausea), rash and abnormal liver values.</seg>
<seg id="1178">In particular, patients with heart problems in prehistory may also have an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1179">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that Adenoic was more effective in lowering uric acid levels in the blood than Allopurinol, but could also pose a higher risk of side effects in connection with the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1180">Treatment of chronic hyperuricaemia in diseases that have already led to primal deposits (including a known or currently present gout and / or arthritis).</seg>
<seg id="1181">If the serum pole acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) after 2-4 weeks, a dose increase can be taken into consideration on ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily.</seg>
<seg id="1182">Efficacy and safety were not fully investigated in patients with severe kidney function (Creatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min, see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1183">Children and young people Since there are no experiences in children and adolescents, the application of Febuxostat is not recommended in this group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Transplant recipients Because there are no experiences in organ transplant recipients, the application of Febuxostat is not recommended in this group of patients (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1185">For patients with ischemic heart disease or decompensated heart failure, the treatment with Febuxostat is not recommended (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1186">As with other harnessing drugs, it can come to an acute attack during the treatment process, because the lowering of the serum resin saw can be used to mobilise uric acid deposits in the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="1187">B. with malignant diseases and their treatment, Lesch- Nyhan-Syndrome) the absolute concentration of Xanthin in the urine in rare cases rises so far that it comes to a deposit in the urinary tract.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Liver disease During the phase 3 clinical trials, slight abnormalities of the liver function values were observed in patients treated with Febuxostat (3.5%).</seg>
<seg id="1189">It is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before the beginning of the Febuxostate- treatment and in the subsequent course (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophylline Zones did not conduct interactions studies with Febuxostat, but it is known that the XO-inhibition could lead to a rise in theophyll lens (an inhibition of theophylline metabolism was also reported for other XO inhibitors).</seg>
<seg id="1191">The simultaneous addition of Febuxostat and Naproxen 250 mg 2 times a day was associated with an increase in the Febuxostasis exposure (CMAx 28%, AUC 41% and t1 / 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical trials, the application of naproxen or other NSAR / Cox-2 inhibitors was not associated with a clinically significant increase in adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicin / Indometacin / Warfarin Febuxostat can be used together with Colchicin or Indometacin without requiring a dosage adjustment for the febuxostat or the other active ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study involving subjects, 120 mg of ADENURIC 1 x daily showed an average 22% increase in the AUC of Desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, indicating a possible weak inhibitory effect of Febuxostat on the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Antazida It could be shown that simultaneous intake of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide, delayed the absorption of Febuxostat (approx. 1 hour) and causes a decrease in CMAX by 32%, but no significant change in the AUC.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregnancies can not be concluded with Febuxostat side effects on pregnancy or the health of the fetus / newborn.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Animal studies do not allow for direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development or birth (see paragraph 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="1198">Patients should be cautious when driving a vehicle, serving machines or when performing dangerous activities until they can reasonably be sure that ADENURIC does not adversely affect their performance.</seg>
<seg id="1199">A numerically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported in the total febuxostasis group in the Pivotal Study of Phase 3 (1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years) and in long-term extension studies (1,4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years), although no statistical significant differences were found and no causal connection with Febuxostat could be detected.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The risk factors that were determined in these patients were an arteriosclerotic disease and / or myocardial infarction or a decompensated heart failure in the medical history.</seg>
<seg id="1201">Frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100) and rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000) side effects, which could occur in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of febuxostat and which were reported more than once in all Febuxostat treatment groups, are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Diarrhea, nausea and vomiting are more common in patients treated at the same time with Colchicin. * * In clinical trials no serious rash or severe hypersensitivity reactions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1203">7 Offene long-term extension studies In the open long-term extension studies, 906 patients were treated for up to 1 year, 322 patients up to 2 years, 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients with Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1204">The events related to long-term extension studies were similar to those reported in phase 3 studies (see table 1).</seg>
<seg id="1205">The following treatment-related events were reported in all Febuxostat- treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients who received Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg in long-term extension studies (up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,900 patient years), according to the data occasionally.</seg>
<seg id="1206">The following treatment-related events were either not reported at all in the pivotal studies of phase 3 or with a lower frequency:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Diabetes, hyperlipidemia, insomnia, hypnotionism, eye-catching ECG, cough, shortness of skin, skin lesion, bursitis, protein urie, renal insufficiency, erectile dysfunction, decrease in the number of white blood cells.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The active mechanism of uric acid is the end product of the purine metabolism in humans and arises in the context of the reaction corkade hypoxanthin → Xanthin → uric acid.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Febuxostat is a potent, non-selective inhibitor of the XO (NP-SIxO) with a Ki value for in vitro-hibition, which is below the nanomolar range.</seg>
<seg id="1210">Clinical study results The effectiveness of ADENURIC was shown in two pivotal studies of phase 3 (APEX study and FACT study as described below), which were conducted with 1,832 patients with hyperuricemia and gout.</seg>
<seg id="1211">The primary efficacy endpoint was in each trial the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly serumaric acid levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) were.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Placebo (n = 134), ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily (n = 267), ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily (n = 269), ADENURIC 240 mg 1 x daily (n = 10) for patients with a serum creatinine value at the beginning of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1213">The APEX study showed the statistically significant superiority of the treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily and ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with normal doses of Allopurinol 300 mg (n = 258) / 100 mg (n = 10).</seg>
<seg id="1214">The FACT study showed the statistically significant superiority of the treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the usual dose of Allopurinol 300 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Patients with serum creatinine values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl) or 300 mg 1 x daily (n = 509) were summarized for analysis. * p &lt; 0.001 versus Allopurinol, # p &lt; 0.001 versus 80 mg</seg>
<seg id="1216">The lowering of the serum resin intake to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and sustained throughout the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1217">In 509 patients, Allopurinol received 300 mg 1 x daily; 10 patients with serum creatinine values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl kept 100 mg 1 x daily.</seg>
<seg id="1218">The primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with renal function restriction The APEX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with renal function restriction (i.e.).</seg>
<seg id="1219">ADENURIC was the primary efficacy endpoint of 44% (80 mg 1 x daily), 45% (120 mg 1 x daily) and 60% (240 mg 1 x daily) of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1220">There were no clinically significant differences in the percentage regression of serum resin concentration in subjects, regardless of kidney function (58% in group with normal kidney function and 55% in group with severe kidney function disorders).</seg>
<seg id="1221">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl of Etwa 40% of patients (APEX and FACT study) had a serum resin concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl (baseline) at the beginning of the study.</seg>
<seg id="1222">The data from the open renewal study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of serum levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l), so less than 3% of patients needed 16-24 to treat gout (i.e. more than 97% of the patients did not need treatment for a gout).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the number of gout nodes, which resulted in 54% of patients having complete disappearance of the gout notes up to 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased TSHIP values (&gt; 5.5 μIE / ml) were observed in patients who received long-term treatment with Febuxostat (5.0%) and in patients receiving Allopurinol (5.8%) in open long-term extension studies (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy subjects, the maximum plasma concentrations (CMAx) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of Febuxostat increased dose after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose-proportional.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses between 120 mg and 300 mg, a rise in the AUC is observed for Febuxostat, which is larger than the dose-proportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily, the CMAX amounts to approx. 2.8-3,2 µg / ml and 5.0-5.3 mcg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1228">However, no clinically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease in serum resin concentration, provided this was tested (multiple doses of 80 mg).</seg>
<seg id="1229">Distribution The apparent Steady-state distribution volume (Vss / F) of Febuxostat ranges from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10-300 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The plasma penetration of Febuxostat amounts to approximately 99.2% (primary binding to albumin) and is constant over the concentration width reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1231">In vitro studies in human liver microsoms showed that these oxidative metabolites are mainly formed by CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C8 or CYP2C9, and that Febuxostatucuronid is mainly produced by UGT 1A1, 1A8 and 1A9.</seg>
<seg id="1232">After taking an 80 mg dose of 14C-labeled Febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose in the urine was found in the urine (3%), Acylgluconid of the active substance (30%), its well known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (13%) and other unknown metabolites (3%).</seg>
<seg id="1233">In addition to excretion over the urine, approximately 45% of the dose in the chair was found in the chair as unchanging Febuxostat (12%), its known oxidative metabolite and its conjugate (25%) and other unknown metabolites (7%).</seg>
<seg id="1234">After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild, moderate or severe kidney failure, the CMAx of Febuxostat did not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The mean overall AUC of Febuxostat increased by about 1.8 times of 7.5 μ g / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.2 μ g / ml in the group with severe kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1236">12 Liver Restriction After intake of multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild (ChildPugh-classification A) or moderate (Child-Pugh-Classification B) Liver restriction, the CMAx and AUC of Febuxostat and its metabolites did not significantly change compared to subjects with normal liver function.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Age There were no significant changes with regard to the AUC of Febuxostat or its metabolites after taking multiple oral doses of ADENURIC in older patients compared to younger subjects.</seg>
<seg id="1238">Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility In male rats a statistically significant increase of urinary bladder tumours (transition cell papillomas and carcinomas) was found only in connection with Xanthin stones in the highly dosed treated group, at about 11-times the exposure to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1239">These findings are seen as a result of specific purine metabolization and urine composition and considered not relevant to clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="1240">It has been noted that Febuxostat in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on the fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats.</seg>
<seg id="1241">At high doses, which were about 4-times the human-therapeutic exposure, maternal toxicity occurred, accompanied by a reduction in the rearing performance and a developmental delay in the descendants of rats.</seg>
<seg id="1242">Teratological studies with carrying rats with expositions, approximately 4.3-fold and in-bearing rabbits with expositions, which amounted to approximately 13-times the human-therapeutic exposure, did not result in teratogenic effects.</seg>

<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the oesophagus, the patient must not lie down until the first food intake of the day, which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">As alendronate and vitamin D3 are already being used separately in medicines that are approved in the European Union, the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in order to prove the effectiveness of ADROVANCE regarding increasing vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15 week treatment the proportion of patients with low levels of vitamin D was lower (11%) in the patients treated with ADROVANCE (11%) compared to those who received only alendronate (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The Company also submitted data suggesting that the alendronate dose contained in ADROVANCE is exactly the dose required to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headaches, pain of the musculoskeletal system (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain, dyspepsia (diarrhea), constipation, diarrhea (ulcera) of oesophagus, dysphagia (swallowing stomach) as well as acidic stumps.</seg>
<seg id="1283">ADROVANCE may not be used in patients with any hypersensitivity to alendronate, vitamin D3 or any of the other ingredients.</seg>

<seg id="1288">Follow these guidelines carefully to reduce the risk for esophageal irritation and related side effects (see Section 4.4):</seg>
<seg id="1289">• ADROVANCE is to be swallowed with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml) after the day. • Patients should not chew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk for oropharyngeal ulcera. • Patients should not lie before the first food intake of the day, which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1290">B. peptic ulcer, active gastrointestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastrointestinal tract, except for pyloroplasty, can be given only with special caution (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Esophageal reactions, such as oesophagitis, esophageal ulcera and esophageal erosions, rarely followed by esophageal lines, were reported in patients taking alendronat (partly these were severe and required hospitalization).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible esophageal reactions, and patients should be pointed out that when symptoms of esophageal irritation such as dysphagia, pain in swallowing or retrocorneal pain or new or worsening heartburn the medicine shall be stopped and medical consultation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of severe esophageal side effects seems to be elevated in patients who are not taking the medicine correctly and / or taking it after the appearance of symptoms that point to an esophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large-scale clinical trials with alendronate no increased risk was detected, gastric and duodenalulcera were rare (after the market launch), some of which were severe and associated with complications (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteonectsis of the jaw, usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection (including osteomyelitis), was reported in cancer patients whose therapy region contains mainly intravenously administered bisphosphonates.</seg>

<seg id="1303">Patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate before taking other medicines (see Sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not carried out, alendronate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clinically relevant interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is only intended for use in postmenopausal women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or breast-feeding women.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with alendronate do not indicate directly damaging effects with regard to the pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal or postnatal development.</seg>

<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus this may lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects including under- or overimmune suppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; changes in the formulation or the regime should be performed only under close-meshed control of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of switching to an alternative formulation, therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>

<seg id="1428">Dosage adjustments in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function. in patients with severe liver function disorders, a reduction of the dose may be required in patients with severe liver function disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since the renal function has no influence on the pharmacokinetic of Tacrolimus, it can be assumed that dosage adjustment is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, however, careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular assessment of serum creatinine levels, a calculation of the creatine inine and monitoring urine volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Conversion from Ciclosporin to Advantf When switching from a Ciclosporin to a tacrolimus based therapy, caution is advised (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Dosage recommendations in full blood The dose should primarily be based on clinical assessment of repulsion and tolerability in individual cases involving thoroughbred Tacrolimus tallow controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to carry out frequent checks of tacrolimus levels during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>

<seg id="1435">As Advantf is a drug with a low clearance, adjustments of the dose may require several days until the Steady State has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the level of blood from tacrolimus in the first time after liver transplantation is usually in the range between 5 - 20 ng / ml and kidney and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant receivers, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has resulted in serious adverse events including graft rejection or other side effects which may occur in a row of tacrolimus sub- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; changes in the formulation or the regime should be performed only under close-meshed control of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be refractory to other immunosuppressants, clinical data for the retarded formulation Advantf are not yet available.</seg>
<seg id="1442">Prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplant recipients and transplant recipients in childhood does not include any clinical data for the retarded formulation advagraph.</seg>
<seg id="1443">For possible interactions which may lead to a lowering of the Tacrolimia levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of Tacrolimus, the use of herbal supplements containing St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) may be avoided or other plant remedies should be avoided during treatment with Advantages (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus blood levels in the blood is provided, as the Tacrolimus blood levels may be subject to considerable variations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases an intraocular or septic hypertrophy designated as cardiomyopathy was observed, which can therefore also occur under Advantal.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical faults are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver dysfunction, infections, fluid overload and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">Like other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the potential risk of malignant skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can influence the metabolism of tacrolimus and, consequently, increase or lower the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore advisable to monitor the Tacrolimus- blood level with the simultaneous addition of substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dose for maintaining the same concentrations (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetics showed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bioavailability of Tacrolimus due to the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolisation.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methyl prednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other drugs tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4-inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus with medicines that are metabolized by CYP3A4 can interfere with their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since tacrolimus can reduce the Clearance of steroid contraceptives and thus increase hormone levels, decisions on contraceptive measures must be particularly cautious.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that tacrolimus may potentially reduce the Clearance of pentobarbital and phenazon and prolong their half-life.</seg>

<seg id="1467">It was reported about benign or malignant neoplasms including lymphoproliferative lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumors in combination with the treatment with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low solubility and the high binding of erythrocytes and plasma proteins it can be assumed that tacrolimus is not dialysiable.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Action mechanisms and pharmacodynamic effects at molecular level are likely to mediate the effects of tacrolimus by binding to a cytosolean protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for enriching the connection in the nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciumatic inhibition of signal transduction units in the T cell and thus prevents the transcription of a certain number of lymphocykin genes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus suppresses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T-helper cells, and also the formation of lymphocycines (such as interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and γ-interferon) and the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>

<seg id="1494">Factors such as a low haematocrit value and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the unbound group of tacrolimus or a reinforcement of metabolism led by treatment with corticosteroids should be responsible for higher clearance rates observed following the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, leaving excretion mainly via bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In case of stable patients, which were changed from Prograf (twice daily) to advagraf (once daily) in ratio 1: 1 (mg: mg) relative to the total daily dose, the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) was nearly 10% lower than under Prograf.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advant is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hemophilia A (a disorder caused by the lack of factor VIII, congenital blood coagulation disorder).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depend on the use of Advantages for the treatment of bleeding or the prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, causing blood coagulation problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but produced according to a method known as recombinant DNA technology:</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) is introduced which enables it to form the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Lawyer is similar to another in the European Union called Recombinate, similar, but is made differently so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, including a study of 53 children under six years, the use of the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of advant in the prevention of bleedings in 86% of 510 new hemorrhage sepads has been rated "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advantages (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against Factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advantages may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human coagulation factor VIII, Maus- or hamster protein or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted the company Baxter AG a licence to transfer lawyers across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage and duration of substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, according to the location and extent of the bleeding and clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hemorrhagic events the factor VIII activity should not fall below the specified plasma levels (in% of the standard or in I.E. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or more until the pain and acute impairment are removed.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Repeat every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the danger for the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment process it is recommended to control the dose to be administered and the frequency of injections appropriate to the factor VIII-plasma-crossbar.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can differ in their response to factor VIII, achieve different in vivo recovery and show different half-value times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3. prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses ranging from 20 to 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight in a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activity is not achieved or if the bleeding with an appropriate dose is not controlled, a test must be carried out to prove an inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The dosing speed should be directed after the patient is found, with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always opposed to the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII directed by IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, where the risk within the first 20 exposure days is the greatest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and an amnestically known inhibitor development, after switching from a recombinant factor VIII product to another, the recurrence of (low titres) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of hemophilia A in women there are no experiences regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs, in the largest number of patients, were inhibitors of factor VIII (5 patients) which all occurred in previously untreated patients with a higher risk of the formation of inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial authorization, the CHMP still evaluated the benefit-risk assessment as positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP has decided on the basis of ADVATE's safety profile, which requires filing of PSURs every 6 months, so that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited granted the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) officially that the company will withdraw its application for the transfer of Advances to the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Usually, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft tissues (tissues that connect, surround and support other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene in the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advantine is an "Adenovirus," which has been modified in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and therefore cannot cause infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin could have been injected directly into the tumors and thus enable the cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is formed from the defect found in the human body of p53 gene, normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and killing the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">At Li-Fraumeni-Cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and cancer cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient who showed Li-Fraumeni-Krebs in the area of the undergrowth, in the bones and in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP inspected the answers of the Company to the questions he asked, there were still some questions unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the initial submitted documents, CHMP creates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to CHMP opinion, the injection of advexin in Li-Fraumeni tumours has advantages for patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee also had concerns about the processing of the medicine in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1652">Moreover, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that advexin can be established in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The Company did not notice the CHMP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or "compassionate-use" programs with advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "modified agent release" "" "means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective components is released instantly and the other is released slowly over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nasal channels caused by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucosa swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards, the recommended dose of Aerinaze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are cluttered.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended, because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measurements were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms that were reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours into a diary and assessed with a standard scale, how heavy the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hay fever symptoms except constipation of the nose, the patients who took Aerinaze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.0% compared to 35.9% in the patients who received pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients under Aerinaze showed a reduction in the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who took Desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart chase), stomatitis, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (somnolence), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic agents or lauatadin (another medicine for treating allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may not be applied to patients suffering from narrow-angle glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure), urinary or vascular disease including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyroiosis (hyperthyrosis), hyperthyroiosis (cerebral hemorrhage) or have a risk of a hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the transport of aerinaze throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but is to swallow whole (i.e. without tearing, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years due to lack of data concerning the harmlessness and efficacy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have gone down.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days, as long-term care may decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory passages, treatment can be continued with desloratadin as a monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or within 2 weeks of ending such a therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimetic activity in combined application of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstriktors such as bromocripitin, pergolid, ergotamine, Dihydroergotamine or other deonicants, which are peroral or nasal as an abusive Rhinology medication (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, napoleolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient's collective and the data is insufficient to give appropriate recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of Aerinaze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data do not suffice to give appropriate recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that the treatment should be terminated in case of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, heart rhythm disorders, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or a strengthening of headaches).</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients with cardiac arrhythmia • Patients with arrhythmia • Patients with myocardial infarction in the anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck construction or bronchospasm in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours prior to the performance of dermatological tests, since antihistamines can otherwise prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In clinical trials with desloratadin, in which erythromycin or ketoconazol was administered additionally, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of lost adin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with desloratadin and the patients treated with placebo, regardless of whether it was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin does not inhibit in-vivo CYP3A4, and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoproteins is.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the application of Aerinaze during pregnancy is not assured, however, experience gained from a large number of affected pregnancies did not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">As reproduction studies on animals cannot always be transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstricting properties of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be applied during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to a dizziness which may result in impaired mobility or ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms can vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, reduced mental alertness, cyanose, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremors, convulsions) with possible letral processes.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, severe miction, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, breathing insufficiency, arrhythmia, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, preventive pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, blurred vision and hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropine-typical symptoms (dry mouth, pupil-rigidity and - dilatation, redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include the inhibiting of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophils as well as the inhibition of the expression of the P-selectator on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance, including the amplification of subjective punctuality or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, at the recommended dose of 5 mg a day no increased frequency of drowsiness was noted in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage may cause other sympathetic effects such as an increase in blood pressure, tachycardia or manifestations of CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine antagonistic efficacy of Aerinaze tablets was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of Aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by nasal mucosa swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with Desloratadin about the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in patient subgroups regarding sex, age or ethnicity.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study on the pharmacokinetic of Aerinaze, the loratadin is detectable within 30 minutes of administration in the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerinaze in healthy volunteers over 14 days, the body weight of the loratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">Within the scope of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects of desloratadin were poorly metabolised.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (CMAx and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the sole administration of pseudoephedrine bioequivalent was to exposure to the gift of an Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated doses, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with desloratadin do not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination lacked any greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies, the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in the oral administration of rats at a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">The pharmacogilance system described in module 1.8.1 of the application for authorisation is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to alleviating the allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's own substance, its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets alleviate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever) such as sneezing, running or itching nose and tearing or itching eyes while constipating the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1707">Under certain circumstances, you may be particularly sensitive to the swelling of the mucosa pseudoephedrine which is contained in this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1708">(diabetes), a stenoside stomach ulcer (ulcer leading to narrowing of the stomach, the small intestine or the oesophagus), a closure of the stomach or duodenum, bronchospasm in the medical history (breathing not due to a Krampf of the pulmonary musculature), a prostate enlargement or problems with the liver, kidney or bladder.</seg>
<seg id="1709">Tell your doctor if you have experienced or diagnosed the following symptoms or diseases using Aerinaze: • hypertension • Heart failure, palpitations, heart rhythm disorders • nausea and headache or strengthening existing headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1710">If you take Aerinaze with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you take other medicines or have it recently taken, even if it is not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Airtightness and the use of machines When using in the recommended dosage, it is not to be expected that aerinol leads to dizziness or reduces attention.</seg>
<seg id="1712">If you have taken a larger amount of Aerinaze than you ought to inform your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of Aerinaze than you should.</seg>
<seg id="1713">If you forgot the intake of Aerinaze If you forgot to take a dose in time, take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time.</seg>
<seg id="1714">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects will affect you considerably or you notice any side effects not stated in this use information.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Heart chase, restlessness with increased physical activity, dry mouth, dizziness, sore throat, loss of appetite, constipation, sugar in urine, increased blood sugar levels, thirst, tiredness, headache, sleep disorders, nervousness and dizziness.</seg>
<seg id="1716">Palpitations or cardiac arrhythmias, increased physical activity, redness, bleeding, confusion, blurred vision, dry eyes, nasal bleeding, irritation of the nose, pain or difficulty passing urine, itching, chills, decreased odor, noticeable liver values, restlessness, anxiety and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="1717">After the market launch of Desloratadin very rarely has been reported about cases of severe allergic reactions (breath not, whistling breathing, itching, hives rash and swelling) or skin rash.</seg>
<seg id="1718">Cases of palpitations, heart chase, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach trouble, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, dizziness, sleep disorders, muscle pain, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, over cases of liver inflammation and over cases of eye-catching liver values was also very rare.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as a 5 mg tablet, 5 mg- lyophilisat for intake (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg / ml melts (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml-solution for inserting.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once a day, which in the form of 2.5 ml syrup or respectively.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or respectively.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in eight studies involving about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies in seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies of patients who had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness has been measured by determining the change in the symptoms (itching, number and size of the squares, impairment of sleep and performance on the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted to prove that the body uses the syrup, the solution to inhale and the melting tablets are utilized in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In the case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius resulted in an average decrease of the symptoms (symptom number) by 25 to 32% compared with the decrease of 12 to 26% in the patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In both studies at Urticaria, the decrease in the symptoms after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared to 40 and 33% in the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, lauatadin or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted approval to the Company SP Europe for the transport of Aerius throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">A tablet once a day, with one or without a meal, for alleviating symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persisting allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical trials to efficacy in the use of desloratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out according to the previous disease progression and can be terminated after the symptoms of the symptoms and resumed when reoccurring.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In the persisting allergic rhinitis (symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks), a continuous treatment can be recommended to the patient during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with lauatadin tablets in which erythromycin or ketoconazol was administered additionally (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not increased when taking Aerius and alcohol (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to dizziness which may result in impaired mobility or ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronically idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily compared to patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most frequent side effects reported as placebo were tiredness (1,2%), dry mouth dry (0.8%) and headaches (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study involving 578 young patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side effect was headaches, this occurred at 5.9% of patients treated with desloratadin and 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study, at which up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine times clinical dose) were given.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes the inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the P-selectator expression on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">There was no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect as part of a clinical study with multiple doses that was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily in a dose of up to 20 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in which desloratadin was administered in a dose of 45 mg. a day (the nine-times the clinical dose) over ten days, no prolongation of the Qtc interval was revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, the lost adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance, including the amplification of subjective punctuality or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nose secretion and itching of the nose, itching, runoff and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis may alternatively be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persisting allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as symptoms of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persisting allergic rhinitis is defined as symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown in the overall report of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Chronic idiopathic urticaria was investigated as a substitute for further forms of urticaria, because the underlying pathophysiology is similar to aetiology in different forms and chronic patients can be easily prospectively recruited.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the histamination is a causative factor in all age-related diseases, it is expected that in other forms of urticaria, desloratadin will also lead to an improvement in symptoms in other forms of urticaria; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in the improvement of pruritus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronically idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who did not react to antihistamines was excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in itching by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desloratadin compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>

<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenera is available as a solution for taking, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir as the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenera should be ordered only if the doctor has checked what antiviral drugs the patient had previously taken, and the likelihood of the virus to respond to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which is taken together with 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily and with other antiviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of asthenase depends on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other antiviral medicines, Agenerase decreases the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS cannot be cured, but it can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral drugs, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">In 206 adults who used protease inhibitors with low-dosed rideonavir drugs were compared with other protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the changes in the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had not previously taken protease inhibitors, after 48 weeks more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml than placebo, but Agenera was less effective than Incaravir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenera also reduced the viral load, but only very few people responded to the treatment by the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults treated with protease inhibitors, the drug Agenerase increased the viral load after 16-week treatment as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, Agenera combined with Ritonavir to a stronger anti-viral load after four weeks compared to patients who received further protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (diarrhea), nausea, nausea, vomiting, skin rash and fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenera may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Amprenavir or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1920">It may also not be used in patients who take St. John's wort (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or medicines that are degraded just as much as ascerase and are injected in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, patients who take apgenerations reduce the risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of the body fat), an osteonecone (death of bone tissue) or an immune reactivation syndrome (symptoms of an infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that in combination with other antiretroviral drugs used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Generic Agenerase is typically used in combination with the pharmacokinetic Ritonavir amplifier, but the committee noted that the use of asthase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who had not previously taken protease inhibitors is not detected.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally approved under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "as limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited to the company Glaxo Group Limited for the transport of Agenerase throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is shown in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) pretreated adults and children from 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Generally, Agenerase capsules should be administered to pharmacokinetic booster of Amprenavir together with low doses of Ritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Amprenavir should be carried out taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pretreatment of the patient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% lower than from Amprenavir as a capsule; therefore, Agenerase capsules and solution for taking on a milligram per milligram base are not interchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase Capsules is 600 mg of Amprenavir twice daily with 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the amplifying additive of Ritonavir (booster), higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase Capsules is 20 mg of Amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Amprenavir that should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of asgenase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Generic Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under the age of 4, due to lack of data for harmlessness and efficacy (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase in adult patients with moderate liver function should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunctions to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with mild or moderate cirrhosis, in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">It may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and are also substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoccm 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a diminished therapeutic effect of Amprenavir during the intake of Amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenera or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy, including treatment with Agenerase, does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Generally, Agenerase capsules should be used together with low doses of ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver problems with potentially fatal outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of concurrent antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing liver function including chronic-active hepatitis show increased incidence of liver dysfunctions under antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored in line with clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Simultaneous application of Agenerase and Ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoid that are metabolised via CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroidal effects including Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal glands (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitors Lovastatin and simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, simultaneous administration of Agenerase with Lovastatin and simvastatin is not recommended due to the increased risk of myopathies including Rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Norised Ratio), methods for determining the concentration of active substances are available.</seg>
<seg id="1948">For patients taking this medicine at the same time, Agenerase may be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of Amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Amprenavir, the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be altered, but the information is insufficient to estimate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given simultaneously with Amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored to take Opiate withdrawal symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the possible risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycol content of the Agenerase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under the age of four and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenera should be set in duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases that could be used to treat medications associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and with drug dependent factors, such as a prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In the case of haemophile patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports of an increase in hemorrhages including spontaneous cutaneous haematoma and haemosteoarthritis are reported.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) may develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections leading to severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although multifactorial etiology is assumed (including the use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term use of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 mediums with low therapeutic width Agenerase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and are also substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoccm 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 mediums with less therapeutic width Agenerase with Ritonavir mustn't be combined with medicines, whose active ingredients are mainly metabolized via CYP2D6 and are linked to increased plasma levels with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes an 82% reduction in the AUC by Amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to compensate the humiliated plasma concentration through a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, adverse events were observed in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of Amprenavir can be brought low by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already takes St. John's wort, the detonate levels and, if possible, check the viral load and suspend the St. John's Wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary if nelfinavir is administered together with Amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased, by 30% for CMAx, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg of Amprenavir were used twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this registrar.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower if detonavir (750 mg twice daily) in combination with caletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily) was given.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Amprenavir in plasma, which have been achieved twice daily with the combination of amdynamavir (600 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily), are about 40 to 50% lower than when Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of prenavir and caletra cannot be given, but close monitoring is recommended, as the efficacy and harmlessness of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacokinetic study was carried out in combination with Didanosin, but it is recommended that the proceeds from Didanosin and Agenerase are at least one hour apart (see antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amponavir (600 mg twice daily) and rideonavir (100 mg twice daily), dose adjustment is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with Amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggests that the nevirapin may reduce the serum concentration of detonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used at the same time, caution is advised, because Delavirdine could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasmacket.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these drugs are used together, caution is advisable; thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out, as an accurate prediction of the effect of the combination of Amprenavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdine is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous addition of detonavir and rifabutin led to an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) by rifabutin by 193% and thus to an increase in side effects connected with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin along with ascerase, at least half of the recommended dose is recommended to reduce the dosage of rifabutin, although no clinical data is available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with erythromycin in combination with erythromycin were not performed, but the plasma levels of both drugs may be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fosamdynamical and 100 mg of ketoconazole once daily led to an increase in CMAx of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to 2,69fold compared to the value observed once daily without the simultaneous application of Fosamdynamical with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or CYP3A4 Inductors, may possibly interact with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored using toxic reactions that are associated with these medicines when used in combination with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors, it is advisable that antacids are not taken at the same time as asthase, as it can cause resorption disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous application of anticonvulva, known as enzyme inductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with Amprenavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma concentration of Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipine, Diltiazem, Felodipine, Israelican, nimodipine, nifedipine, Nimodipine, Nisoldipine, and Verapamil can be increased by 10 through Amprenavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous ingesting with asgenase can considerably increase the plasma concentrations and intensify with PDE5 inhibitors in combination with side effects including hypotension, vision disturbances and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days at subjects, the fluticasonpropionate plasma concentration increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol declined by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous addition of Agenerase with Ritonavir is not recommended along with these glucocoticoid, unless the potential benefits of a treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroidal effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, are to be expected to increase the level of plasma gas at the same time as apatiase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma-cone increases of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy including a Rhabdomyolysis, the combined application of these medicines with Amprenavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">More frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations up to stabilization of the mirrors is recommended as the plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased at the same time as Amprenavir (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase may not be used together with oral midazolam (see Section 4.3), while using parenteral midazolam is advisable.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for the simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma concentration of Midazolam around 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">When methadone is administered together with Amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored to take Opiate withdrawal symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historical comparisons, there is currently no recommendation as to how the detonavirus dosage is to be adjusted when Amprenavir is administered simultaneously with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">At the same time warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenerase, an increased control of the INR (International Norised Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the anti-thrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not foreseeable, so alternative methods for contraception are also recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended at the same time as Agenerase (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This medicine may only be used during pregnancy after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk lacrifying rats, ammonavir-related substances have been detected, but it is not known whether prenavirus passes into breast milk in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, which was administered by evaporation in the uterus up to the end of the lactation period, showed a diminished increase in the 12 body weight in the offspring.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of offspring, including fertility and reproductive capacity, was not impaired by the administration of Amprenavir to the mother animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of Agenerase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most side effects associated with the Agenerase treatment were mild to moderate, occurred early and rarely led to the termination of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events, it is not clear whether they are in connection with taking Agenerase or another medicine used at the same time, or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the reported side effects come from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006) in which patients with protease inhibitors received 1200 mg of Agenera twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4) that were evaluated by the investigators as related to the study medication and performed in more than 1% of the patients, as well as laboratory changes that occur under the treatment (Grade 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with redistribution of body fat (Lipoystrophy) in HIV patients, including loss of peripheral and fast subcutaneous fatty tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophy of breasts and dorsocerebral fat accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2009">In 113 antiretroviral non-treated persons who had been treated with Amprenavir in combination with lamivudine / zidovudine over a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case (Stiernacken) was observed (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006 in 245 NRTI- pre-treated patients in Amprenavir 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients under Incaravir, in combination with different NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or makulopapulane nature, with or without itching and appeared spontaneously during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteonecrosis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term use of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In the case of HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) may develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pretreated patients who received 600 mg of Agenera twice daily with low-dose ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), the type and frequency of side effects (Grade 3 and 4) were comparable; an exception were increases in triglyceride and CPK levels observed in patients who received Agenerase along with low-dose ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In the case of overdosing, the patient is to be observed on signs of an intoxication (see Section 4.8) if necessary, necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active center of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the processing of viral Gag- and gag-polar polyesters with the result of a formation of irregular, non infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro for HIV-1 IIIB was studied both in acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemp concentration (IC50) of Amprenavir is in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM with acutely infected cells and is 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of prenavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans has not yet been defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral non-treated patients with the currently approved Fosamdynamite / Ritonavir dosages, as in other Ritonavir treatment schemes with protease inhibitors, the mutations described have rarely been observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">At sixteen of 434 antiretroviral non-treated patients who received 700mg of Fosamprenavir with 100mg Ritonavir twice daily in the study ESS100732, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, with 14 Isolate genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypic analysis of the isolation of 13 of 14 children, in which a virological failure within the 59 included, protease inhibitors did not show pre-treated patients, showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, G48V, I50V, I41V, V77I, V82A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 and its extension APV30005 (700 mg Fosamprenavir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice a day: n = 107) in patients with virological failure over 96 weeks, the following protease inhibitors were detected:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypic evaluation systems based on genotypic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, I62V, V82A / C / R, I84V, and L90M in conjunction with increased phenotypic resistance on Fosamdynamavir with Ritonavir and a decreased likelihood of virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data, and it is recommended that the current interpretation systems be used to analyze the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Phenotypic interpretation systems based on phenotypic resistance testing can be used in conjunction with genotypic data for estimating the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically-phenotypic Cut-offs for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Amprenavir associated genetic samples generates a certain cross-resistance to Ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data for cross-resistance between Amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral non-treated patients, in which a Fosamdynamite-containing scheme failed (one of them showed resistance to Lopinavir and saquinavir (three out of 25 isolates), indinavir / Ritonavir (three out of 24 isolates), Saquinavir (three out of 24 isolates), and Tidenavir / Ritonavir (four out of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Vice versa, Amprenavir retains its activity against some other protease inhibitors; obtaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistence mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early abortion of a promising therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mutations that can adversely affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">Evidence of the efficacy of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study, in which adults treated with PI (600mg twice daily) and nucleognaloga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, mainly with low-dose rideonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and threescore (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis demonstrated the non-subsuperiority of APV / Ritonavir in comparison to the time-added average change from the initial value (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-partial threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">Evidence of the efficacy of untreated asgenase is based on two uncontrolled trials of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase was used twice daily, 20 mg / kg three times a day, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low-dose ritonavir at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml for a median increase of CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on this data, the expected benefits of "untreated" ascerase should be considered in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the average duration (tmax) up to the maximum serum concentration of Amprenavir is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased, for CMAx, by contrast, reduced by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decline in the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of prenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by food intake, although the simultaneous food intake affected the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and lets closed on a large distribution volume as well as an unobstructed penetration of detonavir from the blood circulation into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, whereby the amount of unbonded ambradia, which represents the active part, is likely to remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound Amprenavir remains constant, the percentage share of the free active component during dosing intervals varies depending on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the range of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 and represent a substrate of CYP3A4 should be administered with caution when given at the same time using asgenerase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The administration of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to a similar daily amputation as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is less bioavailable from the solution than from the capsules; therefore, Agenerase solution and Agenerase capsules are not interchangeable on a milligram-basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Renal Clearance of Ritonavir is also negligible, therefore the effect of renal dysfunction on the elimination of detonavir and rideonavir is likely to be low.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These regimens lead to detonavir plasma levels similar to those obtained from healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Amprenavir twice a day without the simultaneous appointment of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on carcinogenicity with detonavir in mice and rats, malignant hepatocellular adenomas occured in male animals, which corresponded to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3.8- fold (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the development of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been elucidated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the existing exposure data on humans, both from clinical studies and from the therapeutic application.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vitro and in-vitro genotoxicity tests, the bacterial reverse mutation tests (Ames test), mouse lymphom test, microkernel test of rats and chromosomal aberrations of human peripheral lymphocytes, it was neither mutagen or genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in clinical life by measuring AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Until now no significant liver toxicity in patients was observed in clinical trials, neither during the administration of Agenera nor after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on toxicity in young animals treated from an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with detonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In a systemic plasma display, which was significantly inferior to (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposure to therapeutical dosage in humans, however, a number of minor changes including thymus ongation and minor skeletal changes have been observed that indicate a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenera capsules are applied without the amplifying additive of Ritonavir (booster), higher doses of Agenera (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase Capsules is 20 mg of Amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Amprenavir that should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with mild or mild liver dysfunction. in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Norised Ratio), methods for determining the concentration of active substances are available.</seg>

<seg id="2068">Increased risk of Lipoystrophy was associated with individual factors such as increased age, and with drug dependent factors, such as prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2069">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes an 82% reduction in the AUC by Amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="2070">508% increased, by 30% for CMAx, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2071">The Cmin values of Amprenavir in plasma, which have been achieved twice daily with the combination of amdynamavir (600 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily), are about 40 to 50% lower than when Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of prenavir and caletra cannot be given, but close monitoring is recommended, as the efficacy and harmlessness of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with Amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="2074">If these drugs are used together, caution is advisable; thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out, as an accurate prediction of the effect of the combination of Amprenavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdine is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin together with ascerase, at least half of the recommended dose is recommended at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data is available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipine, Diltiazem, Felodipine, Isradipine, Nicola pin, Nifedipine, Nimodipine, Nisoldipine, and Verapamil can be increased by Amprenavir thus increasing the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days at subjects, the fluticasonpropionate plasma concentration increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol declined by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">At the same time warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenerase, an increased control of the INR (International Norised Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the anti-thrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">Simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0.035 mg of ethinyl estradiol plus 1.0 mg of Norethindrone) led to a 22% decline in the AUC and Cmin by Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This medicine may only be used during pregnancy after careful consideration of potential benefits for the mother compared to possible risks to the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2081">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, which was administered by evaporation in the uterus up to the end of the lactation period, showed a decreased weight in the offspring during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2082">The harmlessness of Agenerase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various antiretroviral drugs.</seg>

<seg id="2084">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro for HIV-1 IIIB was studied both in acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2085">The 50% Hemp concentration (IC50) of Amprenavir is in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM with acutely infected cells and is 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells (1 µM = 0.50 µg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2086">Vice versa, Amprenavir retains its activity against some other protease inhibitors; obtaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistence mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2087">Based on this data, the expected benefits of "untreated" ascerase should be considered in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2088">While the absolute concentration of unbound Amprenavir remains constant, the percentage share of the free active component during dosing intervals varies depending on the total drug concentration in the Steady State over the area of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>

<seg id="2099">The bioavailability of Amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% lower than from Amprenavir as a capsule; therefore, Agenerase capsules and solution for taking on a milligram per milligram base are not interchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>

<seg id="2102">In addition, as no dosage recommendation can be given for simultaneous use of Agenerase solution to use and low dose ritonavir, this combination should be avoided in these patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Although a dose adjustment for Amprenavir is not considered necessary, an application of Agenerase solution is contraindicated in patients with kidney failure (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2104">Due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene glycol content, Agenerase solution is contraindicated in infants and children under 4 years of age, in pregnant women, in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2105">Simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive inhibition of the metabolism of these medicines and potentially cause serious and / or life-threatening side effects such as arrhythmias (z.).</seg>

<seg id="2197">If it is necessary due to the patient's discomfort or due to the severity of local skin reactions, a treatment break may be made of several days.</seg>
<seg id="2198">The clinical outcome of the therapy may be assessed after regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Since no data on long-term cure rates of more than 36 months after treatment are available, other suitable therapy forms should be considered in the case of super-deficient basal cell carcinomas.</seg>
<seg id="2200">In patients with recurrent and pre-treated BCCs no clinical experience is present, therefore the application is not recommended in pre-treated tumours.</seg>
<seg id="2201">Data from an open clinical trial indicate that large tumours (&gt; 7.25 cm2) have less likelihood of response to Imiquimod therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2202">Imiquimod was not studied for the treatment of actinic keratoses on eyelids, on the inside of the nose or in the ears or on the lips of the lips.</seg>
<seg id="2203">There are only very limited data on the use of imiquimod for the treatment of actinic keratoses in anatomical places outside the face and scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on actinic keratoses on the forearms and hands does not support the efficacy of this application, therefore such an application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions are frequent, but these reactions usually decrease in the course of the treatment or go back after decomposing the Imiquimiodine cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If local skin reactions cause severe discomfort to the patient or are very strong, treatment may be suspended for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Data from an open clinical study showed that patients with more than 8 lesions showed a lower complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to the immune-stimulating properties, Imiquimodine should be applied with caution in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">From animal studies no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, debinding or postnatal development are produced (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although quantifiable serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) are not achieved after one-off or several times topical application, no recommendation can be given during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most commonly reported and as probable or possibly with the application of Imiquimod-cream related side effects in the trials with three weeks of treatment were local reactions at the site of the treatment of the genital warts (33.7% of patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2212">Among the most frequently reported and as probable or possibly with the application of the Imiquimod-cream related side effects include complaints at the application location with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The patients treated with Imiquimod-cream treated with Imiquimod-cream from a placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial reported side effects are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common, as likely or possibly with the application of the Imiquimod-cream related side effect, were in these studies a reaction to the application location (22% of patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2215">Adverse events reported by 252 in placebo-controlled clinical trials of phase III with Imiquimod-cream treated patients with actinic keratosis are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">According to the test plan, this placebo-controlled clinical trial demonstrated that these placebo-controlled clinical trials often came to local skin reactions including Erythem (61%), erosion (30%), excreoriation / abortion / shed (23%) and oedema (14%) (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">According to the test plan, this review of clinical signs shows that in these trials, with five times weekly treatment with imiquimod-cream, it was very common to severe erythema (31%), severe erosions (13%), and to severe deformation and calorisation (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical studies investigating the use of Imiquimod for the treatment of actinic keratoses, alopecia was found with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment site or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The occasional orale recording of 200 mg Imiquimod, which corresponds to the contents of about 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Clinically severe side effects, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, existed in hypotonia, which normalized after oral or intravenous fluid.</seg>
<seg id="2221">After the topical application of Imiquimod, increasing systemic concentrations of alpha interferon and other cytokines were detected in pharmacokinetic investigations.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal Phase 3 efficacy studies, efficacy was clearly superior to a complete recovery of the inclination during an Imiquimod treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2223">At 60% of the total of 119 patients treated with Imiquimod the patients were completely healed; this was the case at 20% of the 105 patients who were treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">Complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 patients treated with Imiquimod, compared to 5% of 161 with placebo treated male patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of Imiquimod at five times per week for 6 weeks was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed individual primary superficials basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data obtained from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years showed that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all treated patients were clinically cured and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of Imiquimod during three weeks of use in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week treatment-free period, was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, not hypertropic, hypertrophic acne lesions within a related 25 cm2 area of treatment on the scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The annual data from two combined observation studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications of pronouncements, actinic keratosis and superficient basal cell carcinoma generally do not occur in paediatric patients and therefore have not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Cream was studied in four randomised, double blind placebo-controlled trials on children aged 2 to 15 years with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of Imiquimod was not shown in these studies in the dosages investigated there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively).</seg>
<seg id="2234">Minimal systemic inclusion of the 5% Imiquimod cream by the skin of 58 patients with acute keratosis was observed during the three-week application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml when applied in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bags), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The estimated half-life time was about 10 times higher than the 2-hour half-life after the subcutaneous use in an earlier study; this indicates prolonged retention of the medicine in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on the systemic exposure showed that the resorption of Imiquimod was low after topical application to MC-ill skin of patients aged 6 to 12 years and was comparable to that with healthy adults and adults with actinic keratosis or superficient basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study on the dermal toxicity in rat, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; a study on dermal application, which was conducted for four months, showed no similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on the carcinogenicity in mice on three days a week did not induce tumors in the application.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod has only a low system absorption from the human skin and is not mutagen, a risk for man due to the systemic exposure seems to be very low.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors occured in the group of mice treated with the toxic-free cream, earlier and in larger number than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2255">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you use other medicines or have recently used it, even if they are non-prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2256">Do not breastfeed your infant during treatment with Aldara Cream, as it is not known whether imiquimod enters into breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2257">The frequency and duration of the treatment are different in case of inclination, basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratosis (see specific instructions for each application).</seg>
<seg id="2258">Apply a thin layer of Aldara cream on the clean, dry skin spot with the cowards and rub the cream gently on the skin until the cream is completely pulled in.</seg>
<seg id="2259">Men with genital warts under the foreskin must withdraw the foreskin every day and wash the skin area underneath (see section 2 "What do you have to consider before applying Aldara Cream?").</seg>
<seg id="2260">Please talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have the impression that the effect of Aldara is too strong or too weak.</seg>

<seg id="2265">A reduced number of blood cells can make you more susceptible to infections; it can cause you to quickly create a blue stain or cause fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects will affect you considerably or you notice any side effects not stated in this use information.</seg>
<seg id="2267">In addition, you can feel itching (32% of patients), burning (26% of patients) or pain in the areas you have applied to Aldara Cream (8% of patients).</seg>
<seg id="2268">Usually these are lighter skin reactions, which end up in about 2 weeks after the treatment has been terminated.</seg>
<seg id="2269">Occasionally, some patients notice changes in the application location (wound secretion, inflammation, swelling, sharpness, dermatitis) or irritability, nausea, dry mouth, flu-like symptoms and fatigue.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not broken down and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints that complicate movements, reduce pulmonary volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with Alduracyme should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should take place in a hospital or clinic with revitalizing devices, and patients may need appropriate drugs before administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study was mainly focused on the safety of the drug, but its efficacy was also measured by examining its effect on the reduction of GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under the age of five Aldurazyme lowered the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the children treated showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Alduracyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat feeling, fever and reactions at the infusion point.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common adverse events in patients under the age of five are increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement size of pulmonary function), tachycardia (accelerating heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Alduracyme may not be used in patients who may react strongly hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylatic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review every year any new information that may be known, and if necessary update this summary if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Alduracyme will observe patients who receive Alduracyme with regard to the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Genzyme Europe B.V. to bring Aldurazyme to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of the human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammal cell cultures (Chinese Hamster Ovary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzymatic therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Alduracyme should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can, if the patient carries this, can be increased every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Alduracyme may develop infusion-related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, these patients should continue to be closely monitored, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical setting where medical emergencies are immediately available for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, it is expected that almost all IgG patients form IgG antibodies against laronidase, usually within 3 months from the start of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reactions must be treated with caution when using Alduracyms (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer break, the risk of hypersensitivity reactions must be cautiously avoided due to the theoretically increased risk of a hypersensitivity reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2296">Pretreatment 60 minutes before the onset of infusion with medications (antihistamines and / or antibodies) in order to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In the event of mild or moderate infusion-related reactions, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or reduction of infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusion-related reaction, infusion must be stopped until the symptoms have been reduced, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3. (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) and a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with Chloroquine or Procain because there is a potential risk of interfering with the intracellular absorption of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal studies do not directly or indirectly affect the pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see paragraph 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data on newborns exposed to laronidase via breast milk are available, it is recommended not to lactate during treatment with Alduracyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as infusion-related reactions, which were observed in 53% of patients in phase 3 (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under the age of 5 (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions associated with Alduracyme, which have been observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 or older with a duration of up to 4 years, are listed in the following table following the following frequency: very frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the prehistory, severe reactions, including bronchospasm, respiratory and facial edema (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted drug effects related to Alduracyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5, with mostly severe follow-up form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most patients underwent a seroconversion within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment, with a more severe form of follow-up during the age of 5 (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the phase III trial (or until early retirement from the trial), 13 / 45 patients had no detectable antibodies (RIP) assay, including 3 patients, in which there had never been a trial version.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with low to low antibody levels reported a robust reduction in the GAG level in the urine, while in patients with high antibody titres a variable reduction of GAG was detected in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the phase III study and one in the phase 2 trial) showed a marginal to low-neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic laronidase activity in vitro, which did not seem to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions, although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme replacement therapy lies in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrata and the prevention of further accumulation of the enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After IV infusion, laronidase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, most likely via mannose-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study involving the entire spectrum of disease, the majority of patients were from the middle phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for efficacy were the percentage change in expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open label extension study, where they received a further 3.5 years (182 weeks) each week 100 E / kg Alduracyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Aldurazyme showed an improvement in lung function and walking ability presented in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open renewal study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo-Aldurazyme group, as highlighted in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FEV is not clinically significant over this period and the absolute pulmonary volumes increased proportionately to the body size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with hepatitis B, 22 (85%) reached normal liver size by the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a significant decrease in the GAG mirrors in the urine (µg / mg creatinine) was found, which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">With regard to the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients, which was taken into account by using a combined endpoint which clinically consolidates clinically significant changes across the efficacy variable (expected percentages of normal FEV, range of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was conducted in which Aldurazyme was examined primarily for the safety and pharmacokinetics of 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion (16 patients with severe expiration form and 4 with the mean follow-up form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased Gag- levels in urine in the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients, a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) was determined by the Z-Score for this age group. younger patients with the mean follow-up form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed a normal mental development speed, whereas in older patients with severe follow-up form only limited or no progress was detected in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of various alduracyms dosing regimens were performed on the GAG mirrors in urine, liver volume and 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosing schedule with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks may be a substitute for patients experiencing weekly infusions, but it is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosage schemes is equal.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will assess any new information available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the features of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacokinetic profile in patients under the age of 5 was similar to those affected by older and less severely affected patients.</seg>

<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with cisplatin (another medicine against cancer) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy (medicine against cancer) and "maligne" (malignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body) and is likely to spread slightly to other parts of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used as sole therapy in patients who have not previously been treated in combination with cisplatin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapies.</seg>
<seg id="2356">In order to reduce side effects, patients should receive a corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) during treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">"" "if Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, a" "" "antiemetic" "" "(medicine against vomiting) and fluids should be given before or after the administration of cisplatin (to prevent lack of liquid)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood image changes or where certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed, lowered or the dose is reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of pemetremixed thus slows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of pemetremixed into its active form is easier to replace in cancer cells than in healthy cells, which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the medicine and a longer active duration in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant pleural tube, Alimta was examined in a main study of 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study of 571 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared to the effects of docetaxel (another medicine against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (another medicine against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and cisplatin survived an average of 12.1 months compared to 9,3 months in the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time with Alimt was 8.3 months compared to 7.9 months with docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients in which the cancer did not attack the squamous epithelial cells showed longer survival in the administration of Alimta than with the comparative drug.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. to transport Alimta to the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Every bottle of diarrhea must be dissolved with a 4.2 ml 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>

<seg id="2370">In combination with cisplatin, ALIMTA is shown in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for treatment in second-line treatment of patients with loc- and advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, except for predominant disc epithelial histones (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² of body surface (KOF) is administered intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as an infusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the Pemetrexed- infusion on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">To reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid must be given the day before and on the day of the pemetremixed application as well as on the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of pemetremixed, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the dose must be continued throughout the treatment period as well as another 21 days after the last pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also have to receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 mcg) a week before the first pemetremixed dosage and after each third operation cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving pemetremixed, a full blood image should be created before each application, including a differentiation of the leukocytes and a thrombocyte count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and Alanine transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle a dose examination must take account of the Nadis of the blood or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of the previous therapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients must be treated according to the instructions in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are applicable for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC Level 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients not develop hematological toxicity ≥ Grade 3 (except neurotoxicity), the treatment with ALIMTA must be interrupted until the patient has the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be canceled if a hematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity grade 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 can reductio- or no-haematological toxicity grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 years or above, there is an increased side effects risk in patients aged 65 and under age 65.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 because of insufficient data for harmlessness and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials patients with a creatinine-Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min have no dose adjustments that go beyond the dose adjustments that are recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data layer in patients with a Creatinine Clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a dysfunction of &gt; 1.5-times the upper Biliruby limit value and / or transaminase values of &gt; the 3,0-fold of the upper limit value (for liver metastases) or &gt; 5,0-fold of the upper limit value (for the presence of liver metastases) were not specifically investigated in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with respect to bone marrow and pemetremixed should not be given to patients before their absolute neutrophene number has regained a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombo- number of cells again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Dose reduction for further cycles is based on the number of absolute neutrophils, thrombocyte and maximum non-haematological toxicity observed in the previous treatment cycles (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 haematological and nonsexual toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neutropenia were observed when pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with pemetrexed need to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure for the reduction of treatment-related toxicity (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate kidney failure (Creatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid simultaneous ingesting non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsali- cyllic acid (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days after therapy with pemetremixed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients for whom a therapy with pemetremixed is required must avoid taking NSAIDs with a long half-life for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetremixed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in whom these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events including dehydration, high blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with clinically significant fluid accumulation in the transcellular space, a drainage of the effuction before pemetremixed treatment should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 Several cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with pemetremixed unless this active ingredient was administered in combination with another cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, simultaneous application of attenuated living vaccines (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">As the possibility of irreversible deterioration of reproductive capacity is due to pemetremixed, men should be pointed out before the treatment procedure, to obtain advice on how to preserve sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (creatinine-clearing ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high doses (≥ 3 g daily) can result in reduced pemetredigestion with the result of increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Precaution is therefore advisable if high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid in high dosage should be used in patients with normal kidney function (creatinine-clearing ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high doses for at least 2 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetremixed (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since no data regarding the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-life such as Piroxicam or Rofecoxib are available, simultaneous use with pemetremixed must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetre- mixed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The intra-individual variability of coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy require an increased monitoring frequency of the INR (International Regular Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There is no data for the use of pemetremixed in pregnant women, but as with ande- or antimetabolites severe labour defects are expected in an application during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetremixed should not be used during pregnancy, except if it is essential and careful consideration of benefits for the mother and risk for fetus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">As the possibility of irreversible damage to reproductive capacity is due to pemetremixed, men should be pointed out before the treatment begins to obtain advice on how to block the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether pemetremixed is passed into the breast milk and unwanted effects in the breastfed baby cannot be ruled out.</seg>

<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetremixed) is a antineoplastic antifolate that exerts its effect by disrupting important, consequent, follic acid-dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies show that pemetremixed is used as an antifolate with several targets by blocking thymidyl synthase (DHFR) and glycinamidribonucleotide-myltransferase (GARFT), which are folate-dependent key enzymes of the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purplotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicenter, randomised, easy-blind Phase 3 study of ALIMTA plus cisplatin against cisplatin for patients with malignant pleuramesothelioma showed that patients treated with ALIMTA and cisplatin had a clinically significant benefit of survival compared to those patients treated with cisplatin only.</seg>

<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see Section 4.8) may increase if taken together with a fat-rich individual meal or fat-rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a physician or chemist before starting a therapy with alli because the dosage of the antidiabetic should be adjusted.</seg>

<seg id="2521">In a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous application of orlistat and Ciclosporin a lowering of the Ciclosporin plasma concentration was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">For the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick-values (internationally recognized ratio, INR) could be affected (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients treated with orlistat up to 4 full years, the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K as well as beta carotene remained normal.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take a complementary multivitamin supplement before going to sleep in order to ensure sufficient vitamin intake (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">Following the administration of a one-off dose of Amiodarone, a marginal decrease in the amodarone plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see paragraph 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are linked to the pharmacological effect of the medicine, as the absorption of worn fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on the available data is not predictable).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of reported side effects identified after the market launch of orlistat is unknown, since these events were reported voluntarily by a population of uncertain resentment.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that the treatment with alli can lead to conversions with regard to possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and obese patients over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases reported after the market launch of orlistat overdosage, either side effects or similar side effects were reported as with the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on studies on humans and animals, rapid regression of possible systemic effects caused by orlistat's limatorium characteristics can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect places in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine through covalent bonds to active Serin remnants of gastric and pankreatic lipases.</seg>
<seg id="2536">From clinical studies it was derived that 60 mg orlistat, taken three times a day, blocked the absorption of about 25% of the dietary fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials in adults with BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypotheoric, fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">Primary parameters, the change in body weight compared to baseline (at the time of randomisation), was rated as follows: as a change in body weight in the study course (Table 1) and as a share of those study participants who lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first six months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average cholesterol in Gesamtcholesterin was 60 mg -2.4% (baseline 5,20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (baseline 5,26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in LDL cholesterol was 60 mg -3.5% with orlistat (baseline 3,30 mmol / l) and with placebo + 3.8% (initial value 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">In waist circumference, the average change was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting value 103.7 cm) and with placebo -3,6 cm (original value 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after the orally administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, non-metabolized orlistat in plasma could be detected sporadically and at extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of an accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study with obese patients, which was administered to a minimum of systemically-absorbed dose, two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed lactonring) and M3 (M1 after separation of the N-Formyl leucine group) were identified, representing nearly 42% of the total plasma concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2587">The most common side effects are related to the mode of action of the capsules, resulting in increased fat from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2588">These side effects usually occur within the first few weeks after the treatment begins, as you may have not yet reduced the amount of fat in your diet.</seg>
<seg id="2589">With the following basic rules, you can learn to minimize diet-related accompaniments: • Begin already a few days, or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat-reduced diet. • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of the portions you normally take.</seg>
<seg id="2590">If you know exactly how much you eat, the likelihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases. • Divide your recommended amount of fat evenly across daily meals.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Save the amount of calories and fat you are allowed to take per meal, not to take it in the form of a fat-rich main court or a durable table-table, as you possibly have done in other programs for weight reduction. • Most people in whom these accompanying symptoms occur, learn to control them with time by adjusting their diet.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemotherapies, which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), as well as for chemotherapies, which are the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by the additional gift of a corticosteroids (a medicine used as an antiemetic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended, as there is not enough information on the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active agent prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin) to inhibit receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">In three main studies Aloxi was examined in three main studies involving 1 842 adults who received chemotherapies, which are strong or moderate stimulants for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">For chemotherapies, which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with Aloxi were not vomiting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapy, the moderate stimulus for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with Aloxi reported no outbreak in 24 hours following chemotherapy (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolasetron, these values were 63% for aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 out of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd to approve the transport of Aloxi throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated: for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in severely emetogenic chemotherapy because of a cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy because of a cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy may be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given before chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can prolong the thickness of the colon, patients with anamnestial obstipation or signs of a subacute Ileus after injection should be closely monitored.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is advisable with simultaneous administration of Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in cases where the QT interval is extended or which tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, Aloxi should not be used for prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In pre-clinical studies, Palonosetron did not inhibit the activity of the five chemotherapeutics directed against tumors (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytopabine, doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">A clinical study showed no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a Steady State- Concentration orally Metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, the simultaneous addition of CYP2D6 Inhibitors (Dexamethasone and Rifampicin) and CYP2D6 inhibitors (amiodarone, doxorubicin, fluoxetine, sertraline and terbinafin) had no significant effect on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience on the application of Palonosetron in human pregnancies does not occur, therefore Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 mcg of observed side effects (a total of 633 patients), which could at least be associated with Aloxi, headache (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the location (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing experience reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">The group with the highest dose revealed similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups; there were no dose-effect relationships observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were carried out, however, due to the large distribution volume, dialysis is probably not an effective therapy for an overdosage of aloe.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double blind studies a total of 1,132 patients who received a moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cisplatin, carboplatin, ≤ 1.500 mg / m2 Doxorubicin and 250 mg of Dolasetron (half-life time: 7.3 hours) were compared to day 1 without dexamethasone intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomized double blind study, a total of 667 patients who received a highly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2Cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of Ondansetron, which were given intravenously on day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with the medically emetogenic chemotherapy and the study of chemotherapies are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval were comparable to the effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy subjects was the evaluation of the ECG effects of I.V. administered palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After IV administration is followed by an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination of the body with an average terminale half-time of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the area under the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dose-proportional in the entire dose area of 0.390 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After the intravenous administration of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase of Palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations indicate that once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg of Palonosetron was comparable to 3 consecutive days (AUC0- ∞) with the value measured after one-time IV administration of 0.75 mg; however, the CMAx was 0.75 mg higher following the single-recurrent dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated through the kidneys and about 50% are converted into two primary metabolites which have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor compared to Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on metabolism showed that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, are involved in the Isoc CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 in the Metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination after an intravenous single dose of 10 mcg / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in urine, Palonosetron as an unmodified ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a single intravenous bolus injection, the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In patients with severe liver dysfunction, the terminal elimination terminal and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron are increased, but a reduction in the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions which are considered sufficient above the maximum human-therapeutic exposure, suggesting a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 According to preclinical studies, evidence suggests that Palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations that are involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation and can extend the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses Palonosetron (each dose corresponded to approximately 30-times the therapeutic exposure in humans), which were given daily for over two years, resulted in increased incidence of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal marks) and skin tumors in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and since Aloxi is intended for one-off application in humans, the relevance of these results is assessed low for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a negative report in which the failure of approval for the marketing of the drug Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution was recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means alpheon should resemble a biological drug called" "" "Roferon-A" "" "with the same drug, which is already approved in the EU (also referred to as" "" "reference medicines" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by a viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In the case of a microscopic examination, the liver tissue damage damages, furthermore, the values of the liver enzyme Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are significantly increased in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) is introduced, which stimulates these to form the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon submitted data that demonstrate the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (active ingredient structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study on patients with hepatitis C, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the medication after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was taken (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail @ emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int © EMEA 2006 Reproduction and / or distribution of this document is Authorised for non commercial purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns were expressed in such a way that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed cannot be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After the treatment with Alpheon, the disease retaliated in more patients than with the reference medicine; moreover, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test used in the study to determine whether the drug is immune to an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine), is not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be applied to the treatment of Impetigo (a skin infection accompanied by crustal formation) and small infected Lazerations (bite or cutting), abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not to be used to treat infections that have been provable or probably caused by methiciline-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not work against this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under the age of 18 the surface area to be treated should not exceed 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibit the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection had been cleared after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85,6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients under placebo rated the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin patients, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were considered together in Hautwunden, about 90% of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo is not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (stained cavities in the body tissue) or infections that have been provably or probably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an irritation to the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo outweigh the risks during the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmations, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd to the company Glaxo Group Ltd. for the transport of Altargo throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and considered alternative therapy (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of raising awareness or serious local irritation by applying Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment is to be aborted, the ointment carefully wipes away and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection will begin.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retinulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as pathogens or is suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials of uninfected open wounds, Retapamulin was insufficiently effective in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected body occurs after 2-3-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retinulin and other topical means on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after topical application on skimpy skin or infected superficial wounds, clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not to be expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After the same oral administration of 2 times a day 200 mg ketoconazol, the medium Retapamulin EC (0-24) and CMAx increased by 81% after topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe on skimmed skin of healthy adult men.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dosage adjustments are not considered necessary if topical reapamulin is applied during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 Inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are inadequate with regard to a statement on the impact on the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see paragraph 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">The Retapamulin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy if topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of Retapamulin is preferable to the administration of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether the breastfeeding continues / ended or the treatment with Altargo should be continued / terminated, it is necessary to weigh between the benefits of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefits of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the Altargo surgery, the most commonly reported side effect irritation was at the location, which concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated due to fermentation from Clitopilus passeckeranus (formerly Purotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The active mechanism of Retapamulin is based on the selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s subunit of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding site ribosomal protein L3 is involved and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-Bindungsstelle and the Peptidyltransferase center.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding to this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits the peptide transfer, blocking partially P-binding interactions and prevents the normal creation of active 50 ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should the use of retinulin appear objectionable due to the local prevalence of resistance in at least some infectious forms, a consultation should be aimed at by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of Retapamulin opposite S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-response to the treatment with S.aureus, the presence of strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamine ointment was applied daily under occlusion on intact and on scented skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">In 516 patients (adults and children), who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice a day for 5 days of topical treatment of secondarily infected traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Samples were taken on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic inclusion in humans after topical application of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 of screed skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retinulin in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, with little involvement of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro examination on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test, or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in rats micronucleus testing for in-vivo examination of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There were neither male nor female rats signs of limited fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which was achieved up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2 scented skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study of rats at oral dosages ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to ≥ 3-times the estimated human exposure (see above)), development stoicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity were established.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The owner of the marketing authorization must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system, as presented in the module 1.8.1 of the application for authorisation (version 6.2), is and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is used.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The owner of the marketing authorization agrees to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities in pharmacovigilance plan, as described in version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and in the 1.8.2 module of the application, as well as all additional updates of the RMP which are agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for Medicinal Products for human use," the updated RMP is to be submitted simultaneously with the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">If irritation or other signs and symptoms appear in the treated area, you should quit the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not use any other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with Altargo if it was not prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in the eyes, mouth or lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment is out of sight on one of these areas, wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if symptoms occur.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After applying the ointment, you can cover the affected area with a sterile association or a gauze band unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the area.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">"" "" "" "Ambirix is used as part of a two dose vaccination plan, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may be achieved only after the second dose is given." ""</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, ambition can only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection while immunization and ensuring that the vaccination plan consisting of two doses can end.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a catch-up dose is desirable against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"" "vaccines work by assisting the immune system (the body's natural defence)" "" "how it can defend itself against a disease." ""</seg>
<seg id="2728">"" "after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface antigens as" "" "alien" "" "and generates antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2729">"" "Ambirix contains the same ingredients as the vaccination" "" "Twinet Adults" "" "which has been approved since 1996 and the vaccine that has been approved since 1997." ""</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but in the context of a three-dose vaccination plan, Twinrix adults and children will be given children.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinet adult were also used as evidence of the use of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional 208 children study, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12 month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix led between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children a month after the last injection to develop protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection from Ambirix was similar in a six month and a 12 month gap between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection site, redness, maturation (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who may react hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals to the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standard vaccination plan with ambition is made up of two doses, the first dose is given at the time of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose is given.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a blueprint can be vaccinated both for HCV and Hepatitis B, vaccines can be vaccinated with the appropriate monovalent vaccines or with a combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) anti-HBsAg (anti-HAV) anti-HBsAg (anti-HAV) antibody levels observed in the same magnitude as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not fully assured that immunocompetent individuals who have responded to hepatitis vaccination require a vaccination, since they may also be protected by immunological memory with no longer detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection vaccines, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the application of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization diet is recommended with the combination vaccine, which contains 360 ELISA units of the form-inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In the case of hemodialysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs-antibody-value is achieved after the priming-unization, so that in these cases the gift of further vaccines may be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2746">As an intramuscular injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscles could lead to a suboptimal impact, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In the case of thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disturbances, however, Ambirix can be injected subcutanally as an exception as in these cases there can be haemorrhage after intramuscular administration.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If ambient rix in the second year of life was given in the form of a separate injection simultaneously with a combined diphtheri-, tetanus, acellular pertussite, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenza vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients suffering from immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects, it must be assumed that there is no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccines of this wording in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, maturation, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier Thiomyr and preservative-containing vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials 2029 vaccines were given to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years the compatibility of Ambirix was compared with the 3-dose drop-down vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and maturation based on a calculation basis per vaccine dose of Ambirix, but not on a basis of computation per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the dose of Ambirix at 50.7% of subjects, compared to 39.1% of subjects after the dose of the 3-dose-combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects who had received Ambirix had pain, compared to 63,8% among the subjects who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose-combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of maturation was comparable per proband (i.e. about the entire vaccination cycle at 39.6% of subjects who received Ambirix compared to 36.2% in the subjects who received the 3-dose-combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of pronounced pain and maturation was small and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-dose vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study with 1- to 11-year-old vaccines, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the AmbirixGroup was comparable to that observed in administering with the 3-dose-combination vaccine with 360 ELISA-units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11-year-old, however, after vaccination with Ambirix a frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vaccines reported via severe side effects during the 2-dose vaccination with Ambirix or during the 3-dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of formalininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted in vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years, the rate of seroconversion rates for anti-HAV was 99.1% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The non-HBs seroconversion rates were 74.2% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted between 12- and including 15-year-olds, two doses of Ambirix and 147 received the standard combinationvaccine in three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunogenicity was depreciated, the rate of seroprotection (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 was significantly higher compared with Ambirix in the month 2 and 6 after administration of the 3-dose vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune responses received in a clinical comparative study at 1- to 11-year-olds one month after the complete vaccination series (i.e., in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccines either received a 2-dose vaccination scheme with ambient rix or a 3-dose vaccination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In people who were between 12 and 15 years of age, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be detected over at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6-months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response observed in this study against both antigens was comparable to that after vaccination of 3 cans with a combination vaccine, consisting of 360 ELISA units of form-inactivated Hepatitis- A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study involving 12- to and including 15-year-olds it was shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies can be compared 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme compared to that in the 0-12-month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix in the second year of life was administered simultaneously with the freshening chimeromination of a combined diphtheri-, tetanus, acellular pertussite, inactivated poliomyelitis- and 8 Haemophilus influenza vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You may feel very tired, have a dark urine, a pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may require a stationary treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix can not fully protect against infection with Hepatitis A- or Hepatitis B Virus, even if the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child is already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both immaculate boxes (although your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of the vaccination) vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Preventing other infections caused by the liver or causing symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any ingredient of this vaccine, including Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can manifest through itchy skin eruptions, shortness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue. • If you / your child already has an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and before the usual administration of the second vaccination dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, it will recommend 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccine dose (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced levels of effective ingredients is usually given one month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vaccine against the end of the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes Ambirix is injected by persons suffering from severe blood clots, under the skin and not in the muscle. • If you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your body's immune system or if you / your child undergoing a hemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination can not be sufficient so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Tell your doctor if you / your child are taking other medicines (including those you can get without prescription) or if you / your child has been vaccinated / has received / has received / has received / has been planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine has to be given simultaneously with Ambirix, it should be vaccinated in separate places and as different limbs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nonetheless be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually, pregnant women or breastfeeding women are not given, unless they are urgently vaccinated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information about certain other ingredients of Ambirix please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Neomycin (antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2796">If you miss the agreed date for the second vaccination, talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2797">♦ very common (more than 1 case per 10 mixed cans): • pain or discomfort at the spot or redness • Matte • irritability • headache • lack of appetite</seg>
<seg id="2798">♦ frequent (up to 1 case per 10 injected cans): • swelling at the injection point • fever (over 38 ° C) • dizziness • gastrointestinal complaints</seg>
<seg id="2799">Further side effects, the days or weeks after vaccination with comparable combination or single vaccines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare (less than 1 case per 10,000 treated doses) have been reported:</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data that has become known since the initial approval for placing on the market, the CHMP believes that the benefit-risk relationship for the rix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, as Ambirix was only launched in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonia can also be used in patients aged over a month with an incomplete enzyme defect or hyperammonia encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in the prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonites - split into several single doses at meals - swallowed, mixed under the food or administered via a gastrostomy (through the abdominal wall into the stomach-leading tube) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach-leading tube).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study because Ammonites could not be compared to a different treatment or placebo (a placebo treatment, i.e. without active substance).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Amonaps may also cause loss of appetite, abnormal acidity in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, flavoring, stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor, or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that amonaps in patients with disorders of the urea cycle effectively prevent high ammonia levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammongst has been approved under exceptional circumstances due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information to this drug.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients, in which a complete deficiency of enzyme has already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of living).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a belated form (complete enzyme defect that manifests itself after the first months of life) there is an indication for the use if a hyperammonia encephalopathy consists in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with hiccups, AMMONAPS is also available in granule form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually considering protein intolerance and the daily protein intake needed for growth and the development of the patient's daily protein intake.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences, the regular daily dose of sodium-phenylbutyrat is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">For patients suffering from an early manifal deficiency of caramyl phosphate synthetase or ornithine transluorocarbamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with argininosuccinate synthetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with difficulty swallowing because there is a risk for the development of esophagus ulcers if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each AMMONAPS tablet contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, respectively 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium each 20 g sodium-phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency as well as with sodium retention and edema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolism and excretion of sodium polyphenyl butyrate over the liver and kidneys takes place, AMMONAPS should only be applied with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate in young rats at high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg) it came to a slowdown of neuronal proliferation and increased neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functional nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is excreted in humans into breast milk, and for this reason, the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during breastfeeding (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, 56% of patients had at least one adverse event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events assumed that they were not connected to AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very frequently (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by a 18 year-old abnormal female patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in connection with lactatazidosis, severe hypokalemia, corneal topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of an overdose happened in a 5 month old infant with an accidental individual dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity in intravenous doses up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolically active compound, which is formed by acetylation with glutamine into phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted through the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 Patients with disturbances of the urea cycle can be assumed that for each gram, the sodium-phenylbutyrat can be produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is started immediately in order to improve survival chances and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prediction of the early manifal form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infaust, and the disease itself led to death in the course of treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogues within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Hemodialysis, the utilization of alternative channels of nitrogen excretion (sodium-phenylbutyrat, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced food and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborns in postpartal (but within the first month of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">Patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which had already been treated before the first occurrence of hyperammonia encephalopathy was 100% survival rate, but even in these patients it was time for many with mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late manifal form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygotic form of the ornithine transluorocarbamylase deficiency), which recovered from a hyperammonia encephalopathy and subsequently treated permanently with sodium-phenylbutyrat and a protein-reduced diet, survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible even in the treatment and in some patients another deterioration of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyl is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is consumed enzymatic with glutamine in the liver and kidney, where phenylacetylglutamine arises.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined after an individual dose of 5 g sodium-phenylbutyrat in sober-healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, the hemoglobin metabolism and with cirrhosis of the liver after individual surrender as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (not controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients following IV administration of sodium-phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an orally single dose of 5 g sodium-phenylbutyrat in tablet form, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were found 15 minutes after taking.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients suffering from urea cyclic disorders or hemoglobinopathies, phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) was detectable in the next morning no phenylacetate in the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis, which were treated repeatedly with sodium-phenylbutyrat (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medication is excreted by the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus test, sodium-phenylbutyrat had no plasty effects with toxic and non-toxic doses (study 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of an individual dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules are either taken orally (babies and children who do not have to swallow tablets, or patients with difficulty swallowing) or via a gastrostomy parasite or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experiences, the regular daily dose of sodium-phenylbutyrat is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammoniac, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">For patients suffering from an early manifal deficiency of caramyl phosphate synthetase or ornithine transluorocarbamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contain 124 mg (5,4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium-phenylbutyrat, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium-phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat-flutes were exposed before the birth phenylacetate (active metabolite of phenylbutyrat), lesions in the pyramid cells of the brain cortex occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by a 18 year-old abnormal female patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in connection with lactatazidosis, severe hypokalemia, corneal topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of investigations on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle it can be assumed that for each gram, the sodium-phenylbutyrat can be produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible even in the treatment, and in some patients another deterioration of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an orally individual dose of 5 g sodium-phenylbutyrat in granular form, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were found 15 minutes after taking.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the durance of durability, the patient can keep the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature not exceeding 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this procedure, the small measuring spoon contains 0.95 g, the average measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8,6 g sodium polyphenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the drug through a probe, AMMONAPS may also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium-phenylbutyrat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate in the body after consuming proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory tests are carried out, you must inform the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS, as sodium-phenylbutyrat can influence the results of certain laboratory studies.</seg>
<seg id="2866">If you take AMMONAPS with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you take other medicines or have it recently taken, even if it is not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2867">You may not use AMMONAPS during breastfeeding, as the drug may pass into breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases confusion, headaches, flavoring disorders, replacements of hearing, disorientation, memory disruptions and deterioration of existing neurological conditions have also been observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you notice one of these symptoms, contact your doctor or the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of initiating appropriate treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used for the treatment of adult patients with "acute coronary syndrome" (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example with unstable Angina (a form of pain in the chest with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) (an abnormal measured value for electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients undergoing a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help in patients suffering from angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study of ACS treatment in which the effect of angiox was compared with a certain dose or in combination with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another medicine for the prevention of blood clots) with the conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, the patient was often a stent (a short tube that remains in the artery to prevent closure) and additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots like Abciximab und Aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, angiox - with or without the administration of GPI - was as effective in the prevention of new events (death cases, heart attacks or reascularisation) after 30 days or one year as much as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who underwent a PCI, angiox in relation to all indicators was as effective as heparin, except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bivaliddin, other histodine, or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may also not be used in patients who recently had hemorrhage, as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that, during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI, angiox is a acceptable replacement for Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company The Medicines Company UK Ltd for the marketing of angiox across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable Angina / non-ST leverage attacks (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of an emergency attack or if an early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is an IV dose of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If the patient subsequently fails to use a PCI, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resumed for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure, a bolt will be given of 0.5 mg / kg, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dose of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial IV dose of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an intravenous IV infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a single type of bolus of angiox was not studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicinal product should be carefully mixed before the application and the doses should be administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate renal function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subject to a PCI (whether treated with a bivaliant against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is below 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose must be checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, which were included in the III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which led to authorisation, the ACT value was 5 minutes after administration of the Bivalirudin-Bolus without dose adjustment at an average 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients angiox is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angiox may be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intravenous administration of unfractional heparin or 8 hours after completion of the subcutaneous administration of low molecular heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• known hypersensitivity to the active agent or any other component or against histodine. • severe uncontrolled hypertension and subacute bacterial endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and for dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients must be carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when Bivalirudin is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if in case of PCI-patients under Bivalirudin most haemorrhages occur at arterial puncture points, in patients who undergo a perkutane coronary intervention (PCI), bleeding can occur in principle everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients receiving warfarin and being treated with Bivalirudin, a monitoring of the INR value (International Norised Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after treatment with Bivaliddin is again achieved before treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the active mechanism of anticoagulants (heparin, warfarin, thrombolytic or thrombocyte aggregators), it can be assumed that these drugs increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In combination with thrombocyte aggregators or anticoagulants, clinical and biological hemostasis parameters can be monitored regularly in each case.</seg>
<seg id="2911">In relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, debinding or postnatal development are inadequate (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomised to Bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomised to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomised to either unfractional Heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the Bivalirudin group and in the comparison groups treated with Heparin, women as well as in patients over 65 years of age more frequently came to undesirable events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding has been defined according to the Acuity and Timi standards for heavy bleedings as in table 2 footnotes.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and Bivaliddin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An Acuity-severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intraorbital, retroperitoneal, intraocular hemorrhage or bleeding in the point area requiring radiological or surgical intervention, reduction of the hemoglobin mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with a known hemoglobin mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known hemorrhage, reoperation due to bleeding, use of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed localizations, which occurred at more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" punctures, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information on side effects is based on data from a clinical study with a bivaliddin in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalirudin group and in the comparison groups treated with Heparin, women as well as in patients over 65 years of age more frequently came to undesirable events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, were reported in practice after a comprehensive application and are grouped according to system organosities in table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdosing, the treatment with Bivaliddin is immediately to be terminated and the patient is closely monitored with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudin, a direct and specific thrombininhibitor, which binds both to the catalytic center and the anion-binding region of Thrombin, regardless of whether thrombin is bound in the liquid phase or at clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalirudin to thrombin, and therefore its effect, is reversible because Thrombin on its part splits the binding of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4 slowly, thereby regenerating the function of the active centre of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, serum was unable to induce thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS).</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and in patients Bivalirudin shows a dose and concentration-dependent anti-coagulatory effect, which is evidenced by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was carried out with the patients below, an additional bolt of 0.5mg / kg Bivalirudin should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In arm A of the Acuity trial, unfractional Heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable Angina / non-ST midpoint infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomised to receive a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor at the beginning of angiography (at the time of randomisation) or PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the Acuity study, the characteristics of high-risk patients requiring a angiography within 72 hours were spread evenly across the 3 treatment arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">About 77% of patients had a recurrent ischemia, 70% had dynamic EKG changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and approximately 99% of all patients underwent surgery within 72 hours of a angiography.</seg>
<seg id="2932">The primary analysis and results from the Acuity Study for the 30-Tai and 1-year endpoint for the total population (ITT) and for patients receiving aspirin and Clopidogrel according to protocol (before angiography or before PCI) are displayed in tables 7 and 8.</seg>

<seg id="2937">* Clopidogrel before angiography or before PCI 1 A severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intraorbital, retroperito-Neale, intraocular hemorrhage or bleeding in the point area, reduction of the haemoglobin mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known hemorrhage, reoperation due to bleeding, use of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on four-fold and triple endpoints of a randomised double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI (REPLACE-2), are shown in table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the use of angiox in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of Bivalirudin were evaluated in patients undergoing perkutane coronary intervention (PCI) as well as in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Bivaliddin as a peptide is expected to undergo a catabolism in its amino acid components with subsequent reuse of the amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolite resulting from the division of the ARG3-Pro4 binding of the N-terminal sequence through thrombin is not effective because of the loss of its affinity to the catalytic center of thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Elimination takes place in patients with normal kidney function after a first order process with a terminal half-life of 25 ± 12 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Based on conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated doses, genotoxicity or reproductive toxicity, preclinical data does not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="2945">Toxicity in animals with repeated or continuous exposure (1 day to 4 weeks during exposure to 10-fold precstate plasma concentration) was limited to excessive pharmacological effects.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Side effects caused by longer-term physiological strain as a reaction to non-homeostatic coagulation were not observed after short-term exposure similar to that in clinical use, even at a much higher dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2947">If the ready-to-use solution is not controlled under controlled and validated aseptic conditions, it cannot be stored for longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Angiox is a freeze-dried powder in single dose containers made of type 1 glass to 10 ml, which is sealed with a butyl rubber stopper and sealed with a cap made of pressed aluminium.</seg>
<seg id="2949">5 ml sterile water for injection purposes is given into a gas-through bottle of angiox and is lightly squandered until everything has dissolved completely and the solution is clear.</seg>
<seg id="2950">5 ml are taken from the water bottle and diluted with 5% glucose solution for injection or with 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride solution for injection in a total volume of 50 ml to obtain a final concentration of 5mg / ml Bivalirudin.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from 6 years onwards with diabetes that require insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thigh or the upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to control glucose levels (sugar) in the blood or the insulin can not work effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs very slightly from human insulin, and the change means that it acts faster and has a shorter duration than a short-acting insulin analog.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra has been studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In Type 2 diabetes, where insulin is unable to work effectively, Apidra was examined in a study involving 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator for efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was noticed in comparison to a decrease of 0.14% at insulin incubation.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0.30% in normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive to insulin lulisine or any of the other ingredients, or in patients suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose level.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH for the transport of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">As a subcutaneous injection, Apidra can be applied either in the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or to apply subcutaneous injection into the area of the abdominal wall by continuous infusion.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucoogenesis capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism, insulin requirements in patients with a restriction of liver function can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the effectiveness, the brand (manufacturer), insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc-retarded etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or manufacturing method can result in a change in insulin demand.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An insufficient dosage or breakdown of a treatment, especially in patients with insulin-requiring diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and a diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another insulin type or an insulin of another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may require a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of hypoglycemia reoccurrence depends on the actual profile of the used insulin and can therefore change when changing the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">Substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the propensity to hypoglycaemia belong to oral antidiabetic, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrate, fluoxetine, Pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, saloxetate and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympatholytics such as beta-blockers, cloning, guanethidin and reserves, the symptoms of the adrenaline counter-regulation can be weakened or absent.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see paragraph 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin lulisin enters into human breast milk, but generally insulin does not interfere with breast milk, nor is it resorbed to oral use.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Following are listed in clinical trials known undesirable drug-cures, grouped by system organites and sorted by decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very frequently ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000); very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; not known (frequency based on the available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold sweat, cool and pale skin, tiredness, nervousness or tremors, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, lack of concentration, dizziness, excessive dog, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipoystrophy If it fails to continuously change the injection location within the injection range, a Lipodipodystrophy can occur at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemia associated with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given by a appropriately trained person, or by an intravenous administration of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a gluctional injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral blood glucose (especially through skeletal musculature and fat) and by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous gait of insulin lulisin the response occurs faster and the operation time is shorter than with hubris normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 with Type 1 Diabetes melli- tus, insulin sensitivity in the therapeutic dosage range from 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a proportional glucosal effect, and at 0.3 e / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucosal effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has a twice as fast response as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucosal effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data showed that in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal, a similar post-prandial glycaemic control is achieved as with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin lulisin was turned 2 minutes before the meal, a better post-prandial control than with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal, was achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin is turned 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycaemic control is achieved, such as human normal insulin, which is given 2 times before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisin for 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the start of the meal compared to human normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the start of the meal (Figure 1A) and compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
