the package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite their small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features from &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them more readily available .
for more information on how to use &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , and the built @-@ in functions , refer to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or manual .
to load these modules in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings enlar@@ gements .... Open the tab Tools and select the desired modules .
this is a list of default settings modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that there may be more modules on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the package k@@ de@@ base , that &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Extras Cr@@ ashes . then you can view the page that has crashed &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; crash , or the list of crashes if available .
the module An@@ alog filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras View filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
to view the DO@@ M tree view in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or area , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . as default , the display starts with the root node of the document , for example : DVI element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory of local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views , in order to view the contents of your local fil@@ esystem .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of representing ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map . tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
with &amp; FS@@ View ; the size is the size of a file or folder , and the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can easily be recognized even if they are far below in the folder hierarchy . accordingly , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you are considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap display is a rect@@ angle representation that represents a file or folder in your file system . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have meaningful coloring and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over color mode , can be either depth for easy detection of ne@@ sting depth or the picture of another file property such as name , owner , group , or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each feature , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space for representation or whether the area of sub @-@ ordered rec@@ tan@@ gles occur . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the lab@@ eling in the rect@@ angle .
in case of representation algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this target is not always respected . frames are drawn to render the ne@@ sting of the entries , and this frame will need space , which is no longer available to the subordin@@ ate entries . note that less space for the frame is lost when the rect@@ angle is square .
how to split the surface of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . in this case , it is possible for the lab@@ eling and avoid@@ ance of space losses to divide areas so that rec@@ tan@@ gles are created that are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are rows , columns or recur@@ sive branches .
you can specify the minim@@ ally displayed area for an entry over the menu entry View Display in Area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally was &amp; FS@@ View ; intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
the module picture gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras › Photo Gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when you visit the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Galerie › &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; module , a dialog opens that allows you to specify the image of the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tit@@ le &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; page allows you to customize the title of the image gallery page in a text input field . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the option images per line has a slider and a rotation box to set the number of thumb@@ nails of each line in the gallery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; File Name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check box , you can specify whether the file names are shown in the gallery below the thumb@@ nails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to display the image size of the image , specify whether the file size is shown in the gallery below the thumb@@ nails .
with the image size check box , you can see if the images are shown in the gallery below the thumb@@ nails .
in the dialog , place where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders are to be included .
in the Save in HTML file , specify where the HTML page is to be saved .
with the sub@@ folder check box , you can set the sub@@ folders with a slider or a control panel , until which level the sub@@ folders are included .
copy the original images with the check box to copy the original images to the gallery .
using the check box comment file , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
in the check box Custom color depth you can specify a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original images .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings provide easy access to the general &amp; HTML settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
you can find the media playback for the navigation pane in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Windows navigation pane or with the F@@ 9 keyboard short@@ cut .
to play , click in the navigation pane of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and drag the music files you want to listen to in the media playback .
change browser recognition adds a menu entry in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , which allows you to change browser and operating system recognition for individual domains . this is useful for web sites that allow access only with certain browsers .
the default browser detection of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a web page that refuses access to this browser , you can change browser recognition in one of the following options .
change the password in M@@ SI@@ E for sites that reject access with browsers based on mo@@ z@@ illa . for example , you need M@@ SI@@ E browser recognition to call with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail .
pages that do not conform to the W@@ 3@@ C standard or use one &apos;s own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes , are displayed correctly with the identification of these out@@ dated browsers .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam ; albums . more than 1000 digital cameras are digi@@ ti@@ zed with the library g@@ PT@@ 2 . of course , each medium and each card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ ate ; contains a fast image editing with basic image editing tools . you can use it to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE Image plu@@ gins interface ( manual ) modules .
although it is easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC colour management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or lens , which can be searched .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of end users . they should therefore report problems and improvement opportunities .
it opens a dialog with a underlined link . if you are using these short@@ cuts , your web browser will open a page in the error report system . if you are using these links , your web browser will open a page in the error report system .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to encourage you to ask questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam ; in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
you can also visit the digi@@ file ; homepage for news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam ; to learn .
the best start to get started &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; signing up in the Develop@@ er &apos;s Ma@@ iling list . instructions to announce in the Develop@@ er &apos;s Ma@@ iling list by &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when you started &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database . you can enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the path name or click the Fol@@ der icon Fol@@ der icon to select a folder .
in the second field , you will need to specify a local folder on your machine . here , the data output is stored . this path stays the same for all image folders .
later , you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ate ; will also be used as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the upper@@ most folder that contains images as a base folder . no picture will be changed . no picture will be changed during browsing the folder .
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste do not have photos as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and placing it on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can edit and digi@@ ti@@ ze your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My keyword list to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you are using the raw mode of your camera , it can work &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; possibly also b@@ yp@@ assing it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw video cameras in the Help Center assistance menu .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam ; albums . more than 1000 digital cameras are digi@@ ti@@ zed with the library g@@ PT@@ 2 . of course , each medium and each card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . for the actual transmission to the computer , the camera is often used as a USB flash memory device . the camera is then connected via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , distributed software collection for digital cameras , which supports an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widespread protocol that has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need of additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and are slow transm@@ issions via the serial port , this connection is now ob@@ sol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ PT@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to reliably read the preview images of digi@@ K@@ am . if the ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ PT@@ 2 , you might not see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things about digi@@ ti@@ zing ; is how simple its functionality can be extended by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins interface Project ( manual ) is a joint module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as a user can . their advantage is that it is essentially easier &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ reloc@@ ate .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side bars with or L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full@@ screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
drag and drop images works everywhere : you can place an image in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ m , above the horizontal line of separation or into another application window . the only restriction is that a picture cannot be dropped into keywords , data list or searches .
- a file type selection allows you to emphasize the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the tool@@ bar . so the filter on the fil@@ en@@ ame will only work if it is displayed in the icon view .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos that are managed by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard drive , or by the date on which the album was first created . the date can be changed in the properties of the album .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . choose CD Im@@ porting images to be scann@@ ed . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album .
in order to copy or move an album from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop there . in the then appearing menu , you will need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album characteristics allow you to enter information about this collection . in order to access the album features , you must right @-@ click on the album and select album properties in the context menu .
alb@@ um@@ - collections : are a method to mark your albums , so that you can group together under a common name . selecting or del@@ eting new collections from the tool bar can be used to sort your photos . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the settings for collections .
the Alb@@ um@@ - Date : used when you sort your albums by date with View albums . sort by date .
the el@@ dest , average , new test@@ ers : these put the date on one of the oldest , the newest picture or the average section of the album . to do this , try to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder .
when you first have an album in &amp; quot ; open , the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this is to help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first picture in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album symbol , click the right button of the mouse and click in the context menu &amp; quot ; As an album preview , select . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; support the input of keywords for individual photos in the section My keyword list at the bottom of the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection always includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all the images in this album will be displayed in the picture window . each picture is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview using the two magni@@ fying pins in the tool@@ bar .
when you open an album for the first time , you need to wait a short while while thumb@@ nails are generated . this can be avoided by using all preview images in the Extras menu .
information about each image will be displayed below the corresponding preview . what information this is , you can edit via preferences ; set up . select the albums here and customize the thumb@@ nails section .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . the help shows the most important features including all keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot above in the introduction to the main window shows such a help window .
photos are everything about digi@@ ti@@ zing ; works . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . image editing indicates your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them . you can choose all the features that have been digi@@ ti@@ sed or edited . you can choose between viewing images , slideshow or editing images .
you can open image editing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 image editing ... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing ... . in the edit section , you will find instructions on how to edit your photos . you can view and edit your photos with image editing .
you can open a photo in another program by right @-@ clicking the context menu and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of Open . to do so , and how to customize them when your program is not listed , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after processing other image editing programs , you may encounter problems with the metadata contained in the image . some programs do not store these data with when you save the modified image . thus , this information is lost from EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture , etc .
the simplest one is to right @-@ click on the preview and select Rotation . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photo , right @-@ click the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you want to delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam , it is moved into the tr@@ ash bin of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 Picture Del@@ ete or Del . if you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
the view &amp; quot ; My date list ; organizes your photos according to the data . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ kam ; use either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of last modification of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the image view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view , so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown to you .
photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . as soon as a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search .
if a keyword is selected , all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed .
tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to lo@@ gically organize your keywords . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword lists ; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . you can also use your keywords in other programs .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking either on &amp; quot ; My stit@@ ch@@ word ; or click on an existing keyword , and then select New keyword . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing keyword , this keyword will be the sub@@ stit@@ uting of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by right @-@ clicking on the keyword and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by moving it to the desired position in the tree and placing it there . then a menu will appear that gives you the opportunity to move the keyword . a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree .
you can change the properties of a keyword by right @-@ clicking on it and editing keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords .
to select another photo as an album symbol , click the right button of the mouse button and select the album title in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
in order to use keywords , you first need to add keywords . this can happen in two ways : once you have selected the photos you want to use with a keyword , you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords . alternatively , you can right @-@ click on the preview of the images and select from the context menu keyword .
you can tag a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords associated with it . in this way you can set a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event where it was made , etc .
once you have entered a photo with keyword , it will be displayed in the main window under the preview of the image .
you can remove a keyword in which you can right @-@ click the context menu of the photo and select Rem@@ ove from the Sub@@ scription menu . the menu only displays the keywords associated with the photo .
the tim@@ eline view shows a time depend@@ able hist@@ ogra@@ m of the number of images per time unit . a selection box can be moved over this hist@@ ogra@@ m . to select a time@@ frame , you only need to click on the lower rect@@ angle of the selection frame , which indicates the time unit .
in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . it will then appear in the list below .
encomp@@ ass all the elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and more .
end of the search box is a small lamp that becomes green when the search hits . if you click here the filtering will be deleted and all pictures will be displayed again . if the search has not found anything , then the lamp becomes red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this you get a simple search box like the one described above . you can save this search here but as a live search , which always filters what you have entered as search criteria . after you have been saved , it appears filter in the list .
if you are happy with your selection , press OK and the search will be done . the results will be displayed in My search list in the main window . the Text Field Store Search as is used to select a name in My search list . if you want to change your selection again , you only need to select the corresponding entry from the View list and select an option in its context menu .
if you select to edit the search , the search function will appear again with the search information previously entered . if you select to edit as advanced search , the dialog for advanced search will appear to change your previous search . more information can be found in section The Tools for Advanced search .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Del@@ ete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the context menu . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Advanced search provides an extended search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ Database . all rules are added and deleted by operators . an option can be added to this list with search group / search group deleted or deleted from it . in addition , you can create searches of type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures . the less the difference between two image signatures , the more they correspond .
similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop any picture to find a similar . if you slide a picture from somewhere over the icon of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sket@@ ch : free hand color sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ate ; find suitable images . again , a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini @-@ program . you can zoom in or zoom out or hold it . move C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this , of course , pres@@ upp@@ oses that your images contain Ge@@ o data .
in the field below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ cache .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ ate ; provides a be@@ acon in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; add L D@@ em lumin@@ aire from the context menu . the selection will be added to the be@@ acon and its window will be opened . if you are back in the main window , you can quickly open the be@@ acon with L extras icon .
from the preview strip you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right range of the window and drop there . a small arrow tells you which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you choose preview synchron@@ ize from the tool bar and perform Zoo or move operations on one of the pictures , then they are also carried out with the other image . you can compare the same area of the two images .
another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images . if you use pairing links from the tool@@ bar , then the two first pictures are automatically loaded into the areas to compare . the right image is displayed in the right pane . this makes it easier to work through a series of similar images .
of course , the normal dele@@ tion actions also work directly from the lumin@@ aire like e.g. F@@ 4 File Edi@@ ting ....
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both preview images in the be@@ acon . this makes it easy to combine visual differences with exposure data .
in the bottom end of each pane you will find a built @-@ in pan function that you can see on the crossed arrows . in order to pi@@ v@@ ot the visible area of the image , you must click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the preview , both pictures will show the same image area .
the zo@@ oming works as well as in other views . simply use the zoom control under the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; scroll wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both images when you are in the preview mode .

I dare to claim that if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer then you will need to stay longer without stock management for a specific photo . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then you certainly don &apos;t use &amp; digi@@ kam ; . the approach to store the metadata in both a database and in the image files guarantees very fast searches and secure archiving that you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you have to incorporate anything into your system is the structure of information structure unlike data structure . your image files must be organized somehow on your computer . you must decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc . make sure you have to switch to a bigger drive at some point .
you might be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can be quickly found about your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for images you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements , e.g. version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % of the archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new files from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative image .
we also recommend that you save metadata in the editing page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ occurred ; this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written to the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the respective item in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ? for this purpose &amp; digi@@ kam ; to give them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work begins , as you should now assign keywords , labels and an evaluation to each photo . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value . this makes sense , as you can focus on the best photos in the next work .
let &apos;s start with keywords , keywords , as you frequently call in other programs or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically build the tree for you or to put the images in the correct place . sorting the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dra@@ gging a sub@@ tree to another . the changed keywords will be edited by &amp; digi@@ kam ; updated as it tracks the sub@@ trees .
the graphic shows how different metadata is overl@@ apping . this is a very rough representation , since each block of met@@ a @-@ data consists of many sections . file names and calendar dates have properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you just want to let anyone know your photos , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . you &apos;re sure to be interested in how your photos arrive .
look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it more closely , you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I &apos;m telling you that this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you start dreaming , have associations , memories , the historic period is again present , you may even hear the silence .
for others who view your photos , the title might be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer to help him understand what you are moving to understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself .
with &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can save as much text as you want in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) as label . you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time . K@@ DE even provides you with a spell ch@@ ecker .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without navigation system ? was Earth not a te@@ dious planet ahead of Google Earth ? well , because with images the train of the spatial presentation is now running at speed of light .
the possibilities of using ge@@ olo@@ cation are already innumerable and will become even deeper in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually rep@@ licate your trips with images with geographical indications . &amp; gt ; can also export k@@ ml files that you can export with Goo@@ gle@@ Maps . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and den@@ otes the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same freedoms also apply in all modified versions , i.e. also for the works of others .
the following description tells you which information in the installation page is from &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; as information it should be stored :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to use the photographer &apos;s name , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can be used . this field does not support comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators .
author &apos;s title ( syn@@ onym for author line ) : associated with the author . this field contains the work title of the photographer . examples of this may be title like : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a mem@@ o to the author &apos;s field , this must be completed as well .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for off@@ erer ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here , which offers the picture to others .
the solution to this problem is digital water@@ marks . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique in each picture . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; will be available in the near future such a module for batch processing .
topics : disk failures , plate loss , black@@ out , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , life time , temperature , data size , wi@@ dened super@@ sti@@ tions
of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . this kind of losses are the same that can happen to you even with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section we deal with problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics , which causes data loss .
of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which hold longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers over gold coated DVDs , and dollars ; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you believe it is in your discretion room .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors even if they have just been written . therefore , they use a control sum mechanism in order to protect themselves . 75 % of the data is only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and check@@ sums . despite this massive protection they age by chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ bu@@ ster which apparently works wonders for CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50@@ GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
write the media with a description , date &amp; author and store it on a clean , dark dry and protected site . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media .
disk manufacturers keep their statistics for themselves . their manufacturers warranty covers a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : disk failures .
shortly : disks hold the longest if you operate in temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. In lower temper@@ a , the error rate increases dramatically . electronic parts of the controller are the most common error reason , S@@ MA@@ RT can not detect these errors . these are in particular read errors and displacement meters . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files , but these losses can normally be restored without any major problems .
while most electric devices do not make a lot of power , it looks different in devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed process sensors . these can cause serious damage . so , on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause locked key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware aging , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . so protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able result of a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against spi@@ kes is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and gro@@ o@@ ves the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in connector .
if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection , you should be aware that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . it guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also be aware that it provides protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used on your computer , you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system can also be secured . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage sha@@ kes which also include a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of cable mode@@ ms and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a large number of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and are therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds may lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a break @-@ free power supply .
in addition to the protection against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs . this gives you the possibility to store your data and run the system in order . if you buy a U@@ PS then you should be sure that it meets the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its safety with the cost of avoiding these . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can cost you up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W U@@ PS you can keep in mind how well your computer is protected with it . finally , you should think about getting all the cables before you go on holiday .
the Amazon web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data .
they are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home , however very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data on the comparatively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are refer@@ enced to photos . your free storage is limited to 1 GB and you will not want your pictures in full resolution online .
from the point of view of the data backup , the web solutions are very secure . data transfer errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and with the large companies there is a backup and a distributed memory in the offer .
the diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all transm@@ issions are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs are at least secure the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing is that no one tells you if a transmission error occurred , not if it happened in your hardware . all of these disturbances remain und@@ et@@ ected until you one day open a photo and this is to your surprise . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much secure data path than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate interference within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 , you will see thousands of mistakes per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk failures at a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon also be available for Linux and Windows . read this article in English .
this is still in the alpha state . it uses the same protective mechanisms the Z@@ FS is used and is also available for Linux ; but it is not yet part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % at work bench systems . in case of not@@ ebooks , the share of the@@ fts amounts to 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it causes less damage than for example theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; has long been no longer si@@ ghted .
open source fil@@ es@@ ystems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS , and X@@ FS to name the wi@@ dest file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not saved completely before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings of fundamental physical boundaries . it is meant that while technology is further developed there is a natural barrier to this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is more wor@@ sen . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ xel . even DS@@ LR cameras have a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive is now available for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t worry anyone else for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year . so secure your data often according to a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous such as the re@@ installation of your operating system , the replacement of disks or the res@@ izing of hard drives .
suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , a flash hits you if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . don &apos;t forget airplane disasters : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , disaster prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or something like that .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , a common reason for loss of data despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential locking : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snapshot of two times : the complete backup and the last differential backup .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . generates several sn@@ apshots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup has been made . this backup comes from a version@@ ing system closest to the exception that it is scann@@ ed and not running .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have really been changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security using s@@ sh .
backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or other optical media .
at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . any further di@@ lution should happen manually after you have made a complete review .
topics : metadata , IP@@ TC data stored in the image file , associated X@@ MP files , origin@@ als , memory , scal@@ ability , media , retri@@ eving images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing devices , ... , use of the Internet .
for valuable pictures to survive the next 40 years that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood and adol@@ escence , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is unfor@@ es@@ eeable due to your nature , you need to consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate as time passes . unfortunately , there is no other way to for@@ ge a certain vi@@ gil@@ ance . the fewer variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered on the basis of the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone today . so if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : each time you change your computer architecture , storage and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability with and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . * ni@@ x systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and transfer it to a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record has been recognized by the system , but do not hang it .
&amp; Dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; Dollar ; Par@@ ted resident / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of disk in M@@ B@@ gt ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; Dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of the rip if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no more software to read , you can create it yourself . this task becomes easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you shouldn &apos;t use it any more .
P@@ NG has been designed as an open source standard which should replace GIF . it can save much more . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG is able to save gam@@ ma@@ - and chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved color assignment in hetero@@ geneous platforms .
TI@@ FF is widely used as image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( de@@ late ) . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . with some cameras , you can save your images in this format . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG - Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a roy@@ alty @-@ free and open frame format developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and is committed to using metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers already provide D@@ NG and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will also use it at some point .
this may be one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe introduced its XML based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Image resource block ; , a mix of XML and R@@ DF . it is an identification technology that allows users to embed their data in a file themselves . file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ in@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers draw it from an original of your photo , mostly in the raw format , to archive . X@@ MP means that the metadata is stored separately from the image file , but it can cause problems when linking the metadata file and the image file , and as noted above , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything there together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and educational efforts to achieve far @-@ reaching adoption of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera edit , you can use this as temporary f@@ use .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
for a fine editing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed , then you should add the metadata again . these have been cut off from the other programs .
protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them to web galleries , code them in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the Ad@@ dition of a photo to an album , you will find a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ Database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam ; connect it to your computer , turn the camera to the display mode and turn it on . you will find another description in the manual of your camera .
if you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a finished indicator appears at the bottom end and thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for file association for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side bars properties and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog shows file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the Met@@ adata tab displays internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer &apos;s note , GPS , etc. of the image . this information is the same as the metadata side strip from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or image editing . note that some digital cameras are not available .
the easiest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the button Download and then download the selection of all . this loads all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . when downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the photos were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired with the default selection methods from &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and then download Sel@@ ected . the button Sel@@ ected is st@@ owed until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New to download is available . in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images will be downloaded .
if you want to download all the buttons or download the selected ones , a dialog will appear with which you can select the target album in which the photos are stored . you can read the list of existing albums in the My Albums section . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ kam ; download the photos from the camera into the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them at once by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete All button . if you want to delete only some , you need to select them first and then delete ej@@ ected sel@@ ects .
please note that there is no possibility to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera . you should therefore carefully check if the photos have been successfully downloaded ; you should therefore carefully check if the photos have been successfully removed from the camera . if you want to delete the camera file completely , you should do so via the camera menu , as this is much faster .
cameras often do not use very meaningful names for the photos . the fil@@ en@@ ames are normally recycled after the photos are deleted from the camera . this can result in dup@@ licate file names if you upload photos of different recording formats to the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been made to the fil@@ en@@ ame .
in the next section you will find options for turning and mirr@@ oring the image and for date @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this last option , a folder per day will be created automatically .
the first two concern the data about the author in the standard car identity . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you wish to use a different date format than the default format , e.g. in the editing field , you can use the pre@@ fix fot@@ o- % Y@@ - % % D % H : % M : % S . to do so , turn on the option Date &amp; Time . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you are using the camera file name option , you have the option of changing the file names in lo@@ wer@@ case letters . or in upper case letters if you prefer this .
the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ kam ; used for a photo , is shown below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ ate ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to the time point of recording to complete automatic rotation during download . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ adata section , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
automatic rotation is usually turned on , and if your camera does not supply this information , it leaves &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select Auto Turn in the bottom of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was taken , &amp; digi@@ kam ; use this to automatically create sub @-@ albums in the target album when downloading . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras provide this information .
this option is normally switched off , and in this case saved &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . use the Advanced button to select the date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the Download button . then select upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; you where the images should be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the folder you want and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means a position that can be displayed in lati@@ tude and lati@@ tude and which can be displayed on a map . the identification of the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this capability .
if you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser with a click that indicates the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ate ; users who want to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that exi@@ v@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and map references ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via post @-@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic mapping ( manual ) and finally by manual input from known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that integrates a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS receivers . either as a map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you must save this data in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format supported by the ge@@ o @-@ geographical mapping module .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows , and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data from images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same on Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know long@@ itude and lati@@ tude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the in@@ signia of hom@@ ely coordinates , such as map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , showing all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ ate ; try to give you so much control over his work steps as possible . there are many settings that have changed the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; to access these settings , you must select Set@@ ting Settings . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side .
select action can be set to previ@@ ew@@ ed preview or launch image editing . you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; note if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardization and copyright data . these data are automatically written to the appropriate IP@@ TC data fields , if the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface .
author title is a syn@@ onym for author line : this field should include the professional name of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations such as employed photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a closer description of the author field , this must also be filled .
editor is a syn@@ onym for suppliers : use this field to specify the name that the photo offers . this does not have to be the author if this is for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be listed here as these are the picture other &amp; quot ; . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group or agency that provides the picture will be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC rings . this will ensure that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . this metadata also contains other programs and can be imported without being lost .
save images as embedded labels ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , using the cap@@ tions embedded in the images . this allows your cap@@ tions to be read by other image viewers .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse cursor is in the main window over a file . depending on the option selected , this information will be displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ti@@ ate ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam ; try to add , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . any file in a &amp; digi@@ file ; Alb@@ um@@ folder that has none of these extensions has been digi@@ ti@@ sed ; ignored .
you can reset the default settings by pressing the Ref@@ resh button to the right of each category .
each time you open the be@@ ac@@ table these settings will be enabled if possible . however , some images have different sizes and synchron@@ ous mode is not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole picture size , you can only use on fast computers . if you have one , then you can get better view results .
by default , the image editing uses a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the tool@@ bar if you use the image editing in full screen mode .
overl@@ apping and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the picture . these colors are defined here . in the image processing , this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling means that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in colour information . please refer to this article in Wikipedia for the closer explanation .
with P@@ NG compression settings , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not decrease image quality because P@@ NG is using a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . the only effect is that the image data is more time for extrac@@ ting and un@@ packing . if you have a fast calcul@@ ator , you can set this value to a high compression .
use the option TI@@ FF files to comp@@ ress the de@@ late compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF pictures . it does not affect the image quality since the de@@ late algorithm works los@@ s@@ less .
with the setting of los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files , you can save los@@ s@@ less . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG . as this paragraph is written , metadata was not yet supported , but was in the planning .
in earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ kam the image editing was only an image viewer for photos . currently , it is developing very quickly to a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the image editing settings .
the default is that all green pixels are the same . if the straight @-@ line green pixels of the CCD sensor are more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels with odd lines , this difference creates a grid pattern in the output . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option exc@@ els the image a bit soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the auto color balance is used .
this setting is used only if the white balance is not set . default is to use a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the default is the top lights , so the parts of your images that are burned down , due to the inability of your camera to catch the top lights in the settings . the setting colors will create some unusual results , since it displays the top lights in various pink tones . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights .
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still un@@ saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want .
if you select the re@@ construct option , you get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zer ; image processing . in order to keep the time for the dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should go conserv@@ atively .
a dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of color pixels . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or color design .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you with three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks as if A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ic Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w .
if you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color sof@@ tening correction , because it is carried out during raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as colour information from one colour space to the other is to be translated as precisely as possible .
behavior War@@ ning when an image is opened in the image processing / color management module with raw files .
color Profile folder Set@@ ting here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can save all of your profiles .
configuration of ICC profiles You have the possibility here &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be stored . everything can be changed later when the raw file is opened .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures , not the entire screen .
the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you are using . not all profiles are built in the same way . there are some , like Canon , which do not contain any color tone mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma doesn &apos;t correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means you have to do the color mapping yourself .
there are other options such as the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , which allows you to em@@ ulate how to re@@ print your image from one device . this is very useful before you print a picture , because your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore can be very saturated .
for most cameras , it is quite obvious which colour profile is intended for . unfortunately , not on the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course in@@ official :
the Canon profile extension makes it possible to recognize the style for the goal : F for an exact style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image editing . by providing this interface it can support &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use , and they will then be loaded from &amp; digi@@ kam ; these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition , you will also find some in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Pre@@ ferences .
for more information about K@@ IP@@ I modules , please visit the K@@ IP@@ I project at ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper control adju@@ sts the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . the other inter@@ sections switch the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the ad .
on the right @-@ hand side there is a button Automatic Det@@ ection , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the image display mode . currently , Seri@@ al , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage devices are supported .
at the bottom you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera bar . you must specify here the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , on which you hang your camera .
to make your digital camera digi@@ ti@@ sed &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to display mode and turn it on .
check if &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the main window of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can paste all of them here .
the confirmation dialog for moving &gt; Pictures in the sleeves allows you to edit &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze the conversation ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you can see more details when del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album .
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be used sil@@ ently through &amp; digi@@ kam ; if you use the option to apply changes to the right side@@ bar without asking questions . otherwise , you must save the changes with the button Chan@@ ges .
you can also see the display of the editing screen from &amp; digi@@ kam ; when starting , it might accelerate the start @-@ up of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
looking for new photos , it forces &amp; digi@@ kam to search for new or deleted albums / photos . this pro@@ lon@@ gs the startup time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . if something is deleted from the base folder , asks &amp; digi@@ kam ; you if it should delete them from the database .
different color schemes can be edited in &amp; abri@@ kam ; used to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected under Settings Design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ ate ; contains a quick image editing with some basic tools . you can use them to view and edit your photos and to edit and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selecting View / Edit .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam ; they may not be part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see Set@@ ting Image Processing .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size .
a menu bar on the upper edge , including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
editing functions of image editing change your photos . none of the functions will change the original photo before using Save or Save the Save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can &apos;t restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the image .
so you might want to make a copy of your image before changing it . you can save this using file Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore Rest@@ ore button or the button Rest@@ ore the image processing Rest@@ ore in the tool@@ bar . you will then lose any change you have done in the photo since the last saving .
virtually any image editing action can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting or re@@ covering editing by selecting Edit Res@@ produce from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should make use of the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to undo / restore C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; using the reset button or restore button in the tool@@ bar for a moment , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword , by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , image down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made any changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them .
you can enter the photo and zoom out in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the icons in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the tool@@ bar .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : choose magni@@ fying factor automatically
view Full Screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode . you enter the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . usually , the tool@@ bar is displayed . if you do not want to do so , you can change this in the editing dialog by &amp; digi@@ kam ; see the section for setting up image editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print the image in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print single images or whole sets . complete picture preview pages can be printed out of your choice . you just need to select the images using the default methods and select Print As@@ sist from the Album Select menu . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge providing important information and actions for the selected images . the same page bar is available without the navigation file , also in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five riders cli@@ cked on :
multiple Click on the same tab allows the side@@ bar to appear or disappear into the margin .
the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied into the EX@@ IF and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label in other applications , please note these restrictions .
after you have commented it , use either the App@@ ly button or just change to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved .
with this , you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images .
the rating shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select them and use the context menu .
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the code follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword shows a search box to filter the keywords , the keyword tree and a sel@@ ector with the keywords used previously in this &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed session .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered keyword . you can quickly restrict the number of options when searching for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is a further relief when typing keywords in a picture series . if you have entered different keywords , it will be saved for quick access .
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree . keyword names are searched into the IP@@ TC @-@ field keyword .
if several images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this is applied only to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection , if you want to label a selection with a keyword , please refer to the keyword filter section .
the keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar is used with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , keyword and search results . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right @-@ hand side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all generated keywords are available .
you can also drag and drop the tags . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to add keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply pull it out of the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection . then a dialog appears which asks you if you want to set the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter is on K@@ eine keywords which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected using C@@ tr@@ l + a , and then a keyword from the right keyword tree was drawn to the selection and filed there . a dialog asks if this keyword should be set .
this search for changes takes place at each start of the program . it can also be switched off in Settings Di@@ verse .
if you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or more , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator that is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can set an Advanced search through all the elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you just need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group@@ ing . the options then look as follows :
why weren &apos;t Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? free space is limited to 1 GB and you won &apos;t want to save the images in full resolution there .
this article / Tut@@ orial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner come with a predictable devi@@ ance from the actual photographed or scann@@ ed colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow you can reach that the colors on your monitor resemble those from your camera or scanner and the colors that you print or publish on the web to those from your digital dark@@ room .
if the theme comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to press for the results he wants . unfortunately color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions so that you get the desired result .
if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about colour management .
you work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ RGB colour space . ( for more information see below )
your only other image issues are by email or the web where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB does so well and makes life for everyone so easy , why should you use another colour space and so you have to think about color management ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB limitation compared to the colours we can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colours we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the two @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to c@@ alli@@ ate my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you are working in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you have to c@@ alli@@ bri@@ ate your monitor since s@@ RGB tru@@ sts that your ; on@@ itor is ri@@ pped to s@@ RGB . if you work as in the color space of s@@ RGB , you must either c@@ alli@@ bri@@ ate your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual editing .
the functions Norm@@ alize , S@@ ame , Automatic Fig@@ ure and Con@@ trast Enh@@ ancing from the Cor@@ rection Automatic correction menu try to automatically make the most of your colors . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the lumin@@ osity values over the whole picture , so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest spot is as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed .
like this : this method adju@@ sts the intensity channel of the color of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogra@@ m of intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . in this way , almost every lumin@@ ance range achieves the same number of pixels . sometimes the same is achieved with very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only garbage . it is a very powerful operation that causes miracles in a picture or it destro@@ ys it .
automatic balancing : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it detects the dark and bright border tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogra@@ m area .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the wi@@ dest range and a re @-@ ji@@ b of all values in between . this is only visible in full @-@ blown pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance by &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool for carrying the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is somewhat limited as a color space with 8 bits per color is used . so if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure may occur . if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode , which operates in 16 @-@ bit mode , your options for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it using the menu entry Col@@ ors white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be customized in size . on the left hand side both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen . the preview will be dynamically adapted to the tool settings . if you want to see the original image , it is enough to click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target photos has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogra@@ m .
right above , a hist@@ ogra@@ m appears that will be changed dynamically as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogra@@ m is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow is adjusting the shadow details of your photos or even dim down .
to play with the controls above , use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . click on this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . in this way , the temperature and green values are also set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of default settings . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will get the combined result in white balance . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons do exactly this . any adjustment of the white balance you have set can be stored in a text file and rel@@ o@@ ad later .
the Pre@@ ferences button will reset all filter values to their default values and the neutral white balance . note that neutral settings will also show a different picture than your original . if you save them , your original image will be changed .
you can adjust the coding depth per color channel of the mach@@ ined image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the popular JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better for high @-@ quality images . this coding also requires more disk space , computing time and is available for formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG .
this tool will open the same dialog as the editing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color tone mapping can be done by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed guide for using color profiles can be used to consult the chapter Color Management .
another important tool is to find color correction in the menu . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously and allows you to save your settings so you can always make the same mistake and therefore always need the same correction .
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under paint gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zer ; tool color effects provide you with four color effects , a solar @-@ effect effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation was also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect that was created when using a partly developed pressure from a short flash beam and then completed the development of the image . this had the effect that the lighter areas were darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination . the result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely .
the intensity monitors the Solar@@ isation . at about 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase finally produces a negative image that is not to be produced on photo paper .
this is an example of the solar system effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . simply try it , it embell@@ ishes many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for a daylight @-@ optimised colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts . the characteristics make it a film of choice for wildlife photographers .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repeat the strength of the ne@@ on light . in case of large images , the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and lumin@@ osity of the photo . you can , for example , experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the result , use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you make a photo in poor light conditions you can get the opposite problem : a too large satur@@ ation . also in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . any changes you perform can be viewed in the preview . if you like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lamp strength / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is sound correction for improving exposure . even though the dialog for this tool works very complicated , you only need the area of the slider for the application described here . more specific the three slide valves below the hist@@ ogra@@ m .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogra@@ m , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into the picture and that can be moved in order to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn how to use it is to move the regulator and watch how the image changes .
on the right hand side , the original and the preview of the image can be viewed . the preview will be dynamic , based on the settings of the image , updated . on the left side are the following options available .
sc@@ aling : this selection box can be used to show whether the hist@@ ogra@@ m is represented with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera the linear representation is often used . in this case , the linear hist@@ ogra@@ m is dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is more useful .
three controls : the upper one for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle notes , often called g@@ amma @-@ values .
the three colour twe@@ ez@@ ers can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input of shadows , medium and bright tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic alignment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each range . there are also two controls that can be used to inter@@ actively change the output rate as with the input values . for example , the compression of the output values can be used to create a hat@@ ched image as background while something else is in the foreground .
automatic : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : these buttons can store the set values in the fil@@ esystem and load them later . to do this , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input value is automatically adjusted for all shades , means and sun shades . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the entry rate of the hist@@ ogra@@ m for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the Over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
on the left side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings . the following options are available on the right :
modified channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
beside this box there are two symbols to change between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images taken with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most sense . for images with large areas of a constant color , the linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode will help .
for example , if you move a vent@@ ral arrow to the right , for example the bright tones , then you can see that these bright sounds correspond with darker output tones and that the associated image pixels are darker .
on the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see . if you want to move this marker to the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . any curve you have created can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you create this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun shades . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the Over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if found in more than one channel , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ ti@@ sed channel mixer ; image editing is a tool for improving colour channels or changing the color shades of the photo .
the channel mixer is another highly @-@ developed tool to mix the tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu Color Channel Mixer of image editing .
with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogra@@ m : this gives you a first indication how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be seen for comparison with your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture a vertical line in the hist@@ ogra@@ m appears to show you the corresponding color value .
controls for the module are shown at the bottom : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate L@@ umin@@ ance , the picture will keep the general brightness too , as the channel mixer then is THE tool for creating great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome conversion by reducing the color space first .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad Buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any bl@@ ender setting can be saved for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the Over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is enabled . the original image is shown on ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . in the development of digital photography , black / white is a step , since color images can easily be converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scenes and fits particularly well with portraits against the sky .
Oran@@ ge@@ finder : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Oran@@ ge@@ finder .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simul@@ ate mo@@ on@@ light scenes at the time of the day . similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simulated a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : produces warm light and medium tones as it adds a little cold to the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of le@@ aking a pressure and the re @-@ development in a s@@ epi@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 c@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) s@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation ; applying tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimensional texture of the texture on the image .
a paper tex@@ tual effect has been applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed below ( 2 ) to see . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
digi@@ ti@@ zed ; adding tool frames can be added a decorative frame around an image .
keeping the eye of a viewer within the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to the sc@@ attering eye .
type : with this parameter , set the desired frame type for your image . thoroughly circum@@ v@@ ented the image with a colored line , ni@@ ep@@ ce res@@ ets it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , bev@@ elled it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a kno@@ ck effect and decorative add a decorative frame with patterns .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the width of value for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for the print of the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio earlier .
with this handy tool , you can insert simple a format@@ ted text in an image at any place . this also works in several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text orientation , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its features as you need it . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
any setting you chose for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; OK . &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; App@@ ly tool template you can place a template over an image .
use the picture template in image editing can be used to place templates over a picture .
for the template there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to take the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to minimize the size of the template . if you want to add your sten@@ cil to the sten@@ cil , just send an email in English to the &amp; digi@@ file ; mailing list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your templates folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the templates . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the template folder appears . selecting a folder automatically updates the thumb@@ nail of the templates .
under the Pre@@ view there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and position of your image .
magni@@ fy : this button enlar@@ ges the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shrink : this button decreases the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you must decrease the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the picture lying under the template . to do so , take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image is then automatically adapted to thumb@@ nail size .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of them has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but generates , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images .
blur@@ r mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually , it sharp@@ ens no bit , it works rather psych@@ oso@@ cial . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes a really good job . the algorithm has been taken out of Gim@@ p and it is protected by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focus is perhaps the best of the three , since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for custom@@ ization .
photos without focus as well as most digi@@ ti@@ sed images require a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the digi@@ tization process has to combine colors with only minimal differences to a color point . this in turn results in sharp edges a bit blur@@ red . S@@ LR cameras typically require more after@@ math than normal cameras for private users .
in JPEG images a camera has been used in internal sharp@@ ness . images in the raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some scann@@ ers use a sharpen@@ ing filter while reading the image . if you de@@ activate it , you will get control of your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing suit . you can use the menu entry to call for correc@@ tive sharpen@@ ing .
you should be careful with this because the results do not work very naturally : sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also enhances the noise . generally , the most suitable technique for sharpen@@ ing an image can re@@ focus the tool . you can re@@ focus more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than to shar@@ pen it . use the tool to sof@@ ten notes with the menu entry correc@@ ting soft notes and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp masks is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tried first . if you make the blur@@ r mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ates are produced near sharp edges .
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow bigger radi@@ i . therefore , you should shar@@ pen images best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image added to the original . thus , the strength of sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference amount to apply . this allows for a minimum difference to be defined for an edge of the filter . thus areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded and therefore beauty fla@@ ws in faces , heavens and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example for the bl@@ ur mas@@ ked filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . fu@@ zzy masks has been applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focus a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright protected design algorithm of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener filtering . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener filtering . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a blur@@ red mask . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing colors in image editing .
in practice , the circular folding works much better than the G@@ auss &apos;s folding . the G@@ auss &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result also from the source pixel , which is far from the original source pixel . in most cases , the FI@@ R Wiener In@@ verse of the G@@ aus@@ sian F@@ altung is even very strongly influenced by the removed pixels . this causes un@@ desired results .
sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should result in 1 good results .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values are close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you to reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very poor . a useful value is 0.@@ 03 .
Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your blur@@ r is sharp . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 in order to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a non@@ zero value , you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in die size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad Buttons are used exactly for that purpose . any re@@ focused parameter you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all edges , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before changing the picture otherwise . the reason for this is that many operations changes that are not immediately visible , but later leave unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts .
if you read and comp@@ ress pictures , eg . as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
in general , un@@ sharp masks produce better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by the un@@ sharp mas@@ king a larger neighborhood used as sharpen@@ ing .
even under optimal conditions , it can never remove the effect of blur@@ ring . for the Wiener Filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal lens filter . practically , the result of the FI@@ R Wiener Filter is at least as good as the blur@@ red mask . the FI@@ R Wiener Filter is often better in the processing of small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused image :
the original unclear color image will have to be corrected . this picture has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the methods of focus correction in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the slider fe@@ ather sets the blur@@ ring of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink tin@@ ts allow a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , you can adjust it here .
the tool error correction tool is one of the most widely @-@ developed tools to remove unwanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the in@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the Tab@@ s and Advanced Settings .
detail maintenance p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to uniform smoo@@ th@@ ness over the image . a value of 0.@@ 9 should obtain details in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary afterwards . please note that the detail maintenance should always be subordin@@ ated to the direction depen@@ dency .
direction dependence Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes uni@@ form@@ ly in all directions while a value is smoo@@ thed at 1 only in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ul@@ ator or CCD , a high value wa@@ vy @-@ like pattern is generated . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best eliminated at a value near 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all@@ . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . set this value to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image .
repeat : speci@@ fies how often the algorithm is passed . normally , 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angular step length &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is selected small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles create a long run@@ time . so you should ideally choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral stri@@ de width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de width in pixels . you should set the value smaller than 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never bigger than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you get by choosing this option is only low , but it doubles the run@@ time . we recommend it to let it out .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons do exactly this . correct any setting of image errors can be saved to a text file and loaded later .
correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and move a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Canc@@ el button .
below you can see how picture errors can be corrected with small arti@@ facts . the module will be applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a unique black arti@@ fact in the background that caused by a bad film deposit during the trip . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; reduction of noise is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts , e.g. from dust or ha@@ irs on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scann@@ ed images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
below you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced Settings window can remain with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time that the filter needs per pixel and can bl@@ ur the image . the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoo@@ thed and thus cleared smaller errors .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel pitch behind the filter to see lumin@@ ance changes . if it is increased , noise peaks are deleted . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter can no longer receive image details , and noise or lubric@@ ating occurs again .
edges : controls edge accuracy for sharp@@ ness . this value enhances the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the whole noise can &apos;t be removed or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a low noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without loos@@ ing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend changing either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend changing either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma @-@ tolerance of the picture . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas , which are typically more strongly smo@@ thered , but it also mer@@ ges the shadow areas .
atten@@ u@@ ation : controls the adjustment of the phase of the phase . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius re@@ acts to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear smoo@@ ther , if it is too high , noise and phase j@@ itter can occur at the edges .
store and load : these buttons are used exactly for that . all the noise reduction parameters you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) .
sometimes a picture is too cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than sharp@@ ens a picture . use the tool to sof@@ ten the sof@@ ten@@ er with the menu entry correc@@ ting soft notes and experiment with the smoo@@ thing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove pal@@ ettes , film grains , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that appear in digital , original or later digit@@ alized images .
the same algorithm can be used for color and texture rendering . the texture replacement is done with a different tool , the image error correction . the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ s in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : JPEG compression is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it generates some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ ef@@ acts quot ; - small standards that can be seen in the un@@ compressed image .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons do exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and loaded later .
photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take very long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Stop button .
below you can be restored like a photo with uni@@ form@@ able noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious fine @-@ grain on the faces . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected below ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures were reduced to an old colour photo that was read with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts caused by the scann@@ ed light and photo paper . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hot@@ pixel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tool allows hot@@ pixel of photos to be removed with a CCD camera . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Martin Dick@@ opp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality crude mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels ; and &quot; quot ; light pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ picture sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel .
download this file in the Wiz@@ ard with the dark screen button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you record the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels with CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the matching dark picture to the picture to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark picture will find the bad pixel . note that the wizard will notice the last dark and automatically loads it in the next session .
the image area and preview help you to correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then choose the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
Dur@@ ation : an average of the adjacent pixel is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all the faulty pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the faulty pixels in the block .
square : this is the default fil@@ ter@@ method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pix@@ el@@ block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cub@@ ical surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel corrected on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image was enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is shown below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image .
wide angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range evenly . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ lan@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) it the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there .
but it also has disadvantages . many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter , which makes the necessary closing time possible in such a way that it is impossible to use the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller , as there are otherwise blur@@ ring effects caused by movement .
with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s film and color and gray scale depth of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a blank image that was made without this filter . the tool of vi@@ gil@@ ance correction applies the transformation with a C@@ enter@@ filter to an image . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
with three controls you can control the vi@@ gr@@ ation correction filter and with three more exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of damp@@ ing damp@@ ing at the point of the highest density filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which corresponds to an optical filter with aperture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly a light intensity of 2 , reduce it to compensate for a small degree of vi@@ gr@@ ation .
lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controllers only provide you with positive values , since you only have to increase the settings .
if you want to re @-@ adjust the exposure of the target image , leave the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applied to one image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ o ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geomet@@ rical distor@@ tions . color distor@@ tions cannot be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree deals with the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar con@@ centric effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the co@@ effici@@ ents fourth degree correc@@ ts the removed corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ rical distortion can almost be eliminated .
in general : this value controls the strength of distortion second grade . with negative values , t@@ onal distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion grid . this value works more strongly on the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner Par@@ ameters &apos; has the opposite sign of the General parameter .
zoom : this value res@@ izes the image size and leads to a correction of the first degree . negative values magni@@ fy while positive image decreases .
light : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a Pre@@ view illustrates the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start .
the ton@@ ical or cushion correction should be performed before any cutting or size changes . ideally , perform this correction as the first . if you re @-@ cut a picture and then carry out a ton@@ ical correction the effect would be the wrong .
in order to help you find the best correction , this tool provides a vertical and horizontal assistance line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to fix the dotted lines . then move it to an important place , such as the edge of the sea or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards you can correct the ton@@ er / cushion distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion distortion the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove these with the cutting tool in the menu Trans@@ formations of image editing or via the Zoom regulator of this dialog .
the next logical step for some subjects , such as photos from the front , frame and paintings , is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the image have 90 degrees . please note : if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate inf@@ ra @-@ red film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org web page that is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ ar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for the preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can look at the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can set two parameters for film gran@@ ulation and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the option Add film gran@@ ul@@ arity if you want to simul@@ ate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO controller changes the amount of film grains and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in conversion . green meadows are white like snow !
since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect to black / white photos , because the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared fil@@ mic effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the top @-@ lights .
the digi@@ ti@@ sed filter is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce movie grain on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films like e.g. the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the producers mix large silver grains of photo emul@@ sion .
the film Kör@@ ner Eff@@ ect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gran@@ ny view specially in your mon@@ och@@ rome photos , you have to use this filter .
the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although higher values are often required , to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need more grains , you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of the film loading effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed film sensitivity is ISO @-@ 1600 .
the digi@@ ti@@ sed filter ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the digi@@ ti@@ zed ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting . nature pictures and style life are good for this effect .
there are two controls to influence this effect . the upper one sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large pictures . smoo@@ thing controls the smoo@@ thing or , viewed from the other side , the sharp@@ ness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the editing is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel big picture is 1 and G@@ lät@@ te 17 .
the digi@@ ti@@ sed filter uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a cab@@ bage . the lines that define the outlines in the drawing are emphasized . images whose gra@@ dients slowly change are not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you chose to sket@@ ch out .
there are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smoo@@ thing ) .
this is an example of the char@@ coal drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ o ; filter engraving patterns your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the digi@@ ti@@ sed filter is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works especially well with pictures with a simple structure , where color is not the most important in content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a grey , mon@@ strous landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal picture into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave @-@ blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and make it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
wave @-@ blocks 2 : similar to the wave @-@ blocks 1 the picture is distorted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the Stop button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal picture into a work of art by means of blur@@ r effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom ambig@@ u@@ ity : blur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines eman@@ ating from a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to step back into the background .
motion blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : photographed from a car or train , camera .
soft sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image sof@@ tly in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
vibr@@ atory sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image due to random shifting of the pixels and thus simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent blur@@ ring : find the color font in the picture and blur@@ red it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it , by filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time using the End Stop button .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops on your image . this gives it natural to your pictures a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n &apos;s copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the drops . as the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the image .
you can use the &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation ; image editing an area free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you start the filter reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops .
this is an example of the rain drop filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the edited picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photograph has the wrong orientation , you can take it through mirr@@ oring or turning in the right direction . you can find the tools for this in the menu Trans@@ forming Rot@@ ating or Trans@@ forming Spi@@ der .
photo bubbles is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of resolution are reached ? how can you re@@ invent or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job here . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose to change size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is shown below .
the size change tool uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small image with better quality then try the tool to infl@@ ate .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm Photo recovery was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how to change size . these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below :
maintain aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons are used exactly for this purpose . each image size can be saved as a text file and loaded later .
photo @-@ infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Stop .
you can see below an example of photo sho@@ ot@@ ings by enlar@@ ging a small image of the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the standard enlargement of the standard for comparison .
editing a photo is not only a frequently under@@ performed operation but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create an image . image editing allows this very simple . in order to cut a photo you simply need to create the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle . you will see this rect@@ angle as you move the mouse .
if you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut away . you can change the size of the area to be cut by dra@@ gging on the corners of the rect@@ angle . you can create a new rect@@ angle by right @-@ clicking on it .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The cutting button of image editing in the tool@@ bar and the photo will be cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the Save or File save entries in the File menu to save the newly added photo .
in the preview , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog will be preserved .
in the tool Fol@@ ding aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the larger value of the height and the cross format of the width is always assigned .
this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you are using cen@@ timeter , inches or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to center the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or vertically .
at the bottom of the dialog , you can use the Max . ratio knob to set the area for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool after aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( horizontal or vertical ) . if you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are stored as default values depending on the orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cro@@ pped image and not the original image .
the settings of the support help enable you to hide help so that you can put your pictures together better . these help are :
harmonic triangle : harmonic parti@@ tions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third rule , harmonic tri@@ angles are a possibility to share a rect@@ angle in a similarly harmonic tri@@ angles at the diag@@ onal .
golden center : the golden mean is a division that affects various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden divide in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1,@@ 6@@ 18 the golden mean . a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious .
the golden center provides smoo@@ ther auxiliary lines if you put together an image . these aids are listed below :
the Golden spiral will bring you closer to your goal for achieving good results for your photos . compared to the third rule , the golden spiral generates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the viewer &apos;s view along the line of the spiral and creates on this kind a symmet@@ ric visual flow .
a further rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . this rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . it should give something that the eye drops at the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the Golden Tri@@ angles derive from the above @-@ mentioned golden spiral . its verti@@ ces are the central points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that unlike harmonic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles do not represent a tri@@ angular tri@@ angles . diag@@ on@@ als on these lines can cause a static object more dynamic .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise .
the horizontal mirror options mirror and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmonic parti@@ tions .
with the color button you can set the color of the help lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the help lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
if you make a photo , it &apos;s easy to keep the camera vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things turn around an angle . you can do this with the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; image editing and tool free rotation . choose to transform free rotation and adjust the target angle .
turn your picture with the slider angle . the values on this slide are indicated in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button you can set the slider back to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available at the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are displayed on the top right .
for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after moving it over an important point in the image you can attach it to the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you have turned a picture , you will find un@@ desired tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the transforming tri@@ mming from image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the Automati@@ cally cut function . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smoo@@ thes the picture a bit after rotation . however , note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tival trans@@ formations are performed at a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated automatically . on the right side of the dialog , you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty spaces created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty spaces created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle to the top left : indicates the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle right above : indicates the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left corner : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area .
angle right down : indicates the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective the picture becomes a bit blur@@ red . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments generate a double the effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adjusted the perspective you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transforming tri@@ mming from image processing .
the modeling tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part to the opposite . a horizontal loop , for example , will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the bottom part to the left . this is no rotation , the image is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogra@@ m . you can start this module by transforming sciss@@ ors .
use your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can horizont@@ ally and vertically at the same time . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect is displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview pane .
to your help , a vertical and horizontal line is displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image becomes a bit blur@@ red . for a single sh@@ utter this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two cross@@ ings produce twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture has tri@@ angular tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to remove them is to cut the picture with transforming tri@@ mming from image processing .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ ate ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore , the formats available are dependent on your system and , in some cases , by the way these libraries were compiled .
because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to place a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF among them .
if the extension is listed in the list , it will be edited and edited ; you can change this list of file extensions &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; in the configuration section , you will find more information on this .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia .
image compression is the application of data compression methods to digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to save the image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save los@@ s@@ less if specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw picture format , see Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format pictures in JPEG or TI@@ FF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam . in the configuration section , you will find further information on the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ occurred ; .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports loading of qu@@ arri@@ es only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is in &amp; digi@@ kam ; containing more than 200 raw file formats . all supported cameras can be seen at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that are supported by &amp; digi@@ kam ;
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are frequently saved in avi or m@@ peg format . and digi@@ ti@@ sed ; but is not a movie editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in capabilities to view or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playback of movies use to start the program for playback .

if you change steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast already was very good , then you can perform the first four adjustment with the white balance module .
many tools you need to edit the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ kam ; included . your description will follow here .
all image editing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , sof@@ ten@@ er , noise reduction , re@@ focus , un@@ sharp masks , etc . use a uniform dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture applic@@ ation@@ quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar indicates the status of the filter on the current image . to the left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
the left pane shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
the upper section shows the original and the bottom shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper section shows the original and the bottom to compare the effect of the filter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mouse over &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the preview and otherwise the original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the used colors can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and place it on the part of the image you want to preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog is immediately updated .
( 5 ) : in the bottom left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all adjustment of the last use of the module will be noted .
the Properties page displays the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is grouped in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data originate from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini @-@ program . you can zoom in or zoom out or hold it . move C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this , of course , pres@@ upp@@ oses that your images contain Ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used for editing color pal@@ ettes and selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the pallet files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can apply either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors .
in the palette , you can select from a list of installed pallets or search the folders for files .
the cursor is shown in the pallet view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
the color is described below the page view . here you can also change the color name .
it can also be used for selecting . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor to there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the input field Bei@@ m Cur@@ sor is activated under the button color , the color is inserted from the color table at the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ write another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write was selected . this mode allows you to set by selecting the check box under Bei@@ m Cur@@ sor .
a selection that was created in this way as described in the last section can be used along with the actions copying , cutting and inser@@ ting .
&amp; k@@ color edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the proportions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line @-@ end character if there is another color . if there are three numbers in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color pi@@ er on the left .
&amp; c@@ alli@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graphs . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs .
the &amp; k@@ tori@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .

you can choose whether the Gra@@ ph should be re@@ charged or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; c@@ viewer viewer ; can also remember your decision , so that later it will also be used . if you want to change your decision later , you can use the menu item Settings k@@ tori@@ viewer ; set up ... , see also .
if you want to open a graph file outside a running &amp; c@@ alli@@ viewer ; &amp; eg ; in the file browser or the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; c@@ is@@ viewer ; instance , or want to display the graphs to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the current instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but can also change it with the setup dialog .
when starting the program , you can let all graphs of your last session be opened again . again , you can save your choice as well as change it later .
you can also specify how the graph should be split up to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
if you are using multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page should be adjusted to this page . the aspect ratio is ignored . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be completed by the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with a graph@@ ene distributed over several pages without a header and with a different font
the Renew@@ al load page gives the option to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive , and eg ; from another program . you can specify a default behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or let the program ask for each time .
the opening gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; c@@ graph viewer ; specify if a graph is opened outside a running session . you can specify a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or specify that each time it is requested .
the Session Management page gives you the possibility to specify the startup behavior of &amp; c@@ graph viewer ; you can specify a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session ) or decide to be asked at each start of the session .
the context menu , which normally appears in the main window with the &amp; R@@ M@@ B@@ n , opens up additional possibilities :
here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z , are :
the algorithm places the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overl@@ apping as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ ene . it produces representations according to the spring@@ board model . it uses the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a spring@@ board model for ung@@ eri@@ fied graph@@ ene . it uses the Fru@@ ity @-@ Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multiple @-@ lat@@ tice for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the node circular in accordance with the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ cal structures .
opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command that is executed by a shell . the command should specify the graph file as parameters , and display the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can specify &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithms special options , or alter the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
speci@@ fies the type of graph ( er@@ ect or ung@@ eri@@ zed ) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ ene ) .

the K@@ IP@@ I module displays images and provides tools to read and store new images .
this module can be used to read and store new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read pictures from a scanner by the San@@ e project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to make this work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you open the menu item pictures , a dialog appears that allows you to select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to fetch the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window pop@@ s up by selecting the default values duc@@ r@@ oth to select your image . view the preview and customize the area to suit your needs before using the button scanning the image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , bottom corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual , you will find more information .
make sure the window is displayed completely as some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
after you have pressed the button , you need to wait until the scan is completed and the window will appear to determine the image file &apos;s options . please remember that the BM@@ P type is not compressed and therefore creates very large files . you also need to select or create the folder &amp; # 160 ;
screen@@ shots can be created after selecting im@@ porting &gt; screen@@ shots in the menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen fot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if All own program window is selected , the calling program will disappear , so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible workplace .
the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you have to switch to other work@@ tops , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there .
after the screen@@ shot has been made , the dialog options of the target image appear with the options described above .

Fli@@ ck@@ r makes it possible to show his photos to people who are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world , put your camera &apos;s photos online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world .
the ex@@ porting module to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
if you use the module for the first time , you are guided through the process of generating a token . it is used for your authentication . so it is virtually your identity to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so that you can log in to Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after successful registration , the module can send photos to the Fli@@ ck@@ r website . the following page will be presented after a successful registration .
just close the browser window and return to the program . after you have pressed &apos; Yes &apos; , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
when the module ex@@ porting to Fli@@ ck@@ r is started two times , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which displays the current per@@ missions that the module displays . for up@@ loading you need write per@@ missions . the module currently does not support other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions .
the button Add photos should be pressed once you have set all the other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . if you click on the O@@ k button , the upload of the photos to the Fli@@ ck@@ r server starts .
the tags field can be filled with a list of words separated by comm@@ a . these are added to the image as tags during high loading .
with the options Open , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie , you can set the per@@ missions to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you choose to change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos are changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value entered at maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF key of the image and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization provides tools to locate images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , lati@@ tude and lati@@ tude are used .
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographical data , you need a GPS track as XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the above dialog appears then . to create a possible correlation between time and location , you need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data that were recorded at the same locations at the same time as the pictures of your camera .
if the file loads an automatic correlation that indicates the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . place your camera time zone here .
the setting for the maximum time vari@@ ance gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera mode . if the deviation is below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have any track data from a location for pictures , you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all the images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ating and difference in minutes can be used if you have no suitable data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same location . as the dialogue takes the coordinates from one call to the next , you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set up with the displayed map . choose the region in question and si@@ e.@@ Add this time and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the card can be changed between card mode , satellite image and mixed mode .
completely out of the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that the exi@@ x@@ ool is used to provide a pile of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery is a tool for ex@@ porting a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a gallery of HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that should be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to allow for the best possible internation@@ alization .
the panel selection allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML . you do not need to select these albums as hierarch@@ ically . the three buttons on the right @-@ hand side allow you to quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the Al@@ ben@@ preview and the text will appear in the header of the HTML page .
the rider &apos;s appearance defines the general look and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . the option For each image creates a page creates a new page in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ Show .
the tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all your corresponding images . choose a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images .
you can change the default color depth with other color depth . of course , this also affects the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the rider preview pictures allow you to customize some of the settings from the Album Tab@@ s for the preview images , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to determine if error occurred during creation . the web browser will automatically start to preview the gallery . press Cl@@ ose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool for viewing images .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rotation , zo@@ oming or shifting . the viewer can be used with short commands and buttons . it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed to a wind@@ owed mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of the loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases since no compression of the color information takes place . this can be found for example also in the P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Digital Camera Client is a tool for connecting your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently does not have any documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the mailing list k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the Import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then invoke the Import function . this will open the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but do not write in any destination format . JPEG is supported when writing . please refer to exi@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Enco@@ der module is a tool to convert a series of pictures into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG Enco@@ der module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages . you can also insert a basic image transfer between the individual images . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slideshow .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
first you need to select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au . after that , you can start creating the module using Tools MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au .
the images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change the sorting of the images or the contents of the list .
after you &apos;re happy with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you need to select the corresponding TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should specify the time in seconds that will display a picture . the speed of the image transfer is defined below . a low value produces very sudden , a high , very smooth image change .
the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should leave them black . you can specify the name and path of the created file under the name of the m@@ peg @-@ output file . if possible , keep the extension mp@@ g as possible .
if you specify an audio file named the source of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . once you have adjusted all settings to your preferences , you can use the code to start the creation of the movie . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now quickly or quietly enjoy a cup of coffee and enjoy the slideshow if you are back .
if an indication appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck pack@@ ets via the Settings button below .
the printer Wiz@@ ard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct printing .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RA@@ W format to one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quotation from Him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first select the RA@@ W file that is to be converted and run the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window then appears in the mode for a single image . with the Pre@@ view button , you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides if the camera settings should be used for white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amp can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected for you to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG @-@ switch has no effect .
once you are happy with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tag@@ ged Image Format , TI@@ FF , retains all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you plan to edit your images frequently or later use it otherwise , you should not choose the JPEG format , as there is only a limited number of operations allowed before image quality deterior@@ ates . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as memory format , the metadata that is included in the RA@@ W file is stored in the JPEG file in the Ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion button to start the conversion . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el .
the batch converting mode allows you to convert different images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , for example by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , they have the possibility to over@@ write existing files automatically . this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar indicates how far the conversion is completed .
this module can be used to convert all images into an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , start number and tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can scale or enlarge the image . in addition , four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : res@@ izing in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option , for example , to customize your image to the screen format .
non @-@ proportional : not proportional size in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
print Pre@@ par@@ ation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adapted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
after you have started the module , the image window will be shown with the images you have selected . you can add more images via the button Add images . for the last selected image , a preview will be previ@@ ew@@ ed on the right .
you can also drag images to the picture list and place it there to add you to the list of images to send .
with the button images remove the selected pictures from the list of images to send .
once you have selected all the images you can open the OK button of your e @-@ mail client with the button OK . you just have to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures you have selected are attached as attachments .
do not take care to send too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations to the size of emails sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending images . your configuration is stored and used again every time you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must enter the right path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments are added to the images in a text file and the mail is attached .
the P@@ NG format from the File Format menu is not very well suited to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted for los@@ s@@ less formats like TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG images in JPEG format and are the original files in JPEG format , the original Ex@@ if@@ data will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not automatically be closed so that you can view the status messages in the search for errors . your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . with the Cl@@ ose button you can close this window .
after starting the Advanced Di@@ ash@@ au you will find a window with questions about how to display your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL transitions in the presentation activate very elegant displays using Open@@ GL . however , you have to have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slideshow will be very slow .
the File Name option ensures that the file name of the images is shown in the bottom left corner while the presentation is displayed .
the Loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an endless loop . you can then manually slide it with Es@@ c .
the option of random@@ ly choosing images ensures that the images are displayed in random order . so it is not the order of the pictures used in the album .
the distance between the images can be set between the images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds are 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect .
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly choosing a different effect between the pictures .
during the slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn it on .
with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slideshow .
at the left lower edge of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date does not currently have any documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool for setting an image as background image for the desktop .
this module uses the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; Browse through these images , see picture . as you can see by comparing them with the image , there are now entries in each group , i.e. persons , places and in the group keywords .
in the browser window you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you add your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course look at the current thumb@@ nails .
if you press the mouse on the entry , the browser view changes . see picture .
if you select another person , only the images appear on which both persons can be seen . through this selection method , you can restrict the number of displayed images from a few thousand images to a few individual images .
if you have selected all people , places and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area of activity .
in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of their name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own preview image , which is of course also for places , keywords , and other categories you have defined yourself . see the picture .
in order to display images next to the name , select the button located on the right of the tool@@ bar . in the pop @-@ up context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have any suitable images for your keywords ) .
however , you need to specify which image is to be displayed for each individual person . to do this , you will need to open the image asset window ( described in more detail ) and select the image for the corresponding person . in the view window , you can customize the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
when you enter the search in the main window , a dialog will display to you that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog on the picture again .
if you enter a string into the inscription or description field , the cap@@ tions and descriptions of the pictures are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to be searched ; the date can be either part of the total date , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the bottom part of the window you can browse all the images by specific names as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user &apos;s manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you do not like to read manuals , but want to try the same functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the home page of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick entry , screen@@ shots and the introduction videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ Demo . then some sample images are loaded and you can try the features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try it .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this bar displays the date statistics on the pictures in your database .
each bar then displays a different unit . you can switch between units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 minutes .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entry preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date is displayed in the preview ) and the tim@@ eline displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview .
you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . if you select a range , you will see only pictures of that time in the preview . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you with two ways to create HTML websites with your images . one is available in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; included and the other as module available ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album is described ; integrated version that you can create from the menu File HTML ...
before creating HTML pages , you need to make some adjustments . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and destination . in the following , each area is described more precisely .
first enter the title of the overview and a description , which should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you will see an example for these settings .
next , select if a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ export file should be created that can be seen on the overview page . read information about export files in .
finally , you can choose which information is to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid information displayed to the viewer without a description . for example , all images from a party are displayed . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why they are not specifically dealt with .
at the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images . this means those who view your website and own a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no longer download images that have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you have defined . so he can search your images with low resolution , resulting in a lower transfer time . if he wants to get a picture larger , he changes to a higher resolution .
in this settings area , specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored .
it is best to select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first , select the main folder in which all your pictures will be saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added next time . this allows you to select the location for all future images . here you can select either a folder or a supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if these are all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files you create are not in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them there . to enable the import function , see , properly , you need to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings described above have all three based on base folders or URLs . a sub@@ folder is created in these , whose name you specify in output folder .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; coming together , you might want to create your pictures with them . however , if you have already spent a lot of time applying the picture information , persons on the pictures , recording location , etc . then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work will not do again .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import others into your database .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ in files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to images . the advantage of saving all images in the file is that you have all the images together and that this file can be passed on independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can either export a .@@ k@@ in file directly from the File menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ in file along with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ in file looks for the images in a tw@@ o@@ fold manner . first , it searches the images that are in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the images are not found , the images of the URL you have specified when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ in file using HTML export .
the following describes the dialog for ex@@ porting images that you can access via the File Ex@@ ports menu .
the most important option for this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available to you :
if you want to copy manually to the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automati@@ cally copy near the .@@ k@@ in file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth comp@@ ressing the files .
the last option on this page is to limit maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you may not want to send the images in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file is otherwise very big . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the Import file ... select &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in description .
the wizard to import is made up of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then to which folder the import images should be copied .
it can be that you specify the category of people to be imported to the imported file ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is called in your database . therefore , in the third dialog window , you will be asked which categories of the file to be imported and which categories match them in your database .
in the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . you can see an example of this in the image .
it has to be easy to browse and view pictures : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups . if you look for example pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual you will go through the different steps of ( 1 ) capture the information about your pictures , via ( 2 ) searching and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and custom@@ ization options .
Photo@@ Album has started as a program to manage your pictures . however , it has been expanded and today it will take care of your videos . in many places in this manual you talk about pictures , but often this includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; saves all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the upper@@ most folder of its images . it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where you want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; records the folder in which your images are stored and will use it in future starts automatically . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; using the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you will get to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , you will see the various settings options .
to the left you can see six different icons , with which you can access settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can access by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the desired option .
it was described how you can define different properties for each picture , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
click on the dialog that is used to process already existing groups . for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol .
sub @-@ categories have already been mentioned in the section . in the Options dialog , you can set up full members groups , i.e. all members of a group at one time in a group , instead of all groups of a medi@@ ator as explained in .
in the left half of the window you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; spl@@ its its module system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface .
the modules can be accessed through the modules menu . the modules can and will not be described in this manual because they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page , which you can access via the modules itself .
since the modules are used by several applications together , it can be that the modules have been tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; therefore , you should always test new modules with the demo database before you use them on your own pictures . demo database can be accessed either via the command line using the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu .
the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , which makes it possible for some modules to work with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications include their pictures in albums : an album is simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates for some modules the order by albums , so that you can use the features with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ;
thus simul@@ ating &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , i.e. all images that show you the picture preview at the moment .
besides the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have to pass a list of albums . here &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you have set in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so if you use the category persons , for example , you will use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do , so whether you have selected people to view it and pass it on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . to do so , start the settings dialog and select the modules to load modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used to from any other K@@ DE application , you will see at the top a menu and a tool@@ bar . below the tool@@ bar you will see the window with which you can browse your image database . in the section we will return to this window , but now click on the entry pictures showing you an overview with all existing pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to provide any picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons shown in the picture , where the picture is taken , etc . you can set each image either individually or for a larger number of images at the same time .
all of these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see those comments if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
view three lists with a text box by setting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; since you can always use them when you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is based on moving images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are m@@ apped , you can , because the names used are moved up , find the people faster and assign .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the sorting icon by date below the list .
if you have selected notes for each picture individually , you may want to edit all selected images and add comments to them . in this case , simply click the above and back buttons , which are located under the thumb@@ nail of the image above .
if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Sever@@ al entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the US . San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as an overview . to show you that it is a super@@ group , a special icon is displayed .
in the Com@@ ment dialog context menu it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition , you can simply drag an entry into a category and place it there , in order to make it an sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this requires you to sort your categories alphabe@@ tically .
you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the buttons that form the upper edge of the frame . you can also make your own window by drawing it out of the window area .
if you have adjusted the appearance of the window so to your needs , that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options ... button , which gives you among other things the possibility to save the current layout and appearance of the window .
you can also completely hide a frame . if you would like to see this window again later , use the Options ... and then window / hide window . this will be seen in the picture .
if you select the pictures in the browser , you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected images , or of all images in case you have not set a filter . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button . try it .
if you drop an image on the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , it will be displayed in the image viewer . if you have not opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the images you want to delete and press either the Del@@ ete button or select Del@@ ete Select in the Edit menu . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you with a solution for this problem . you can use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use pictures somewhere , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can view the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the picture you can see the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all needed images can be loaded from the hard drive .
images in which the right upper corner is trun@@ cated are not stored on the hard drive . however , for images 5 @-@ 9 the thumb@@ nails are present , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , you can &apos;t view these pictures with the image viewer .
as you can see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them into . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not yet support you to insert the CD in question . so , if you want to avoid anno@@ y@@ ance on how to avoid inter@@ locking your images , please buy a larger disk to store all images on it .
in the Pictures menu you will find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want a little more privacy , filter the pictures in such a way that at the end those who want to make it in@@ accessible and click on the current view lock in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also control all the images that your little sister can see , and lock the menu item All in addition to current view .
this means that you have set which pictures should be hidden in the case of the case . if you now give your laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry pictures closed , so that all pictures you have locked will be hidden . if you want to get the pictures shown again , click on lock .
it is also possible to specify a password which must be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select Password change in the Privacy menu .
please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , all images on the hard drive and on the other can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this kind of password protection only serves to rep@@ el the view to private images .
the reason you all want your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and describe hours over hours with it is natural that you want to consider them sometime . for this reason &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; using a picture _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview as described in .
you can see the viewer in the picture . of course he shows the picture , but additional all the information you have entered through the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the Info@@ Box is on the top part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and place somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is to be displayed . all of these options are available right @-@ click on the viewer .
if you click here on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and down . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and End . these functions can also be accessed from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus .
a very useful feature of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
if you use the viewer you can enter the image in the image and zoom out . the zoom button lets you zoom in again using the mouse . the Plus button zo@@ oms in in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom @-@ rect@@ angle is selected and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the dot button you can reset your zoom so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the key button sets the zo@@ oms , so that each pixel corresponding to the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work in videos that are in and out with the plus and minus @-@ button .
you can rotate the image using the context menu functions from the context menu . this does not work for videos . you can make comments on the current image using the comments from the context menu .
if you look at pictures it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten to put on the picture . at the moment you can preview the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter these names .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while watching one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to provide pictures with features while you look at them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . in view , you will see an image in which the characters A , B and C are set .
this is described in detail . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the preview . if you want to view categories in the thumb@@ nail view then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the character for the mark after the image was selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case you will be allowed &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; to paint on the picture .
the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . in the way you can reverse your painted later .
in order to turn off the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , select On the picture paint from the context menu . to finish the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er , you must not fully control the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; but the documentation for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray should be read and understood .
in the object tree you can select single objects . then their properties are displayed in the properties properties and the object is displayed in the wire mod@@ ell@@ ar views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an object already selected , as all sub @-@ objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click either the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the In@@ sert menu .
if there are multiple possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed to enable you to choose the right position :
you can delete selected objects from the scene using either the Edit menu bar or the right mouse button context menu .
if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to accept those changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and click App@@ ly , or disc@@ ard the changes with Canc@@ el .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the object shown with the help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture you can see a preview in the property view .
press preview in property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as a default , the whole texture is rendered , even if you want to render only a portion of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross local .
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is chosen , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a Visi@@ bility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the Visi@@ bility level of the higher @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only when they are selected or their Visi@@ bility level is smaller or equal to the field of Visi@@ bility level chosen in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window setup or if you need another arrangement , you can set them as you like . you can also save several window arrangements and simply switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window above or below an existing view , pull the anchor to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position .
to create a new column , pull the anchor to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views over one another , drag the anchor in the middle of another view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the flash@@ cards at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement is floating views : views which are not anchored in the main window . in order to solve a view from anch@@ oring , drag the anchor to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left in the support bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the bev@@ elling bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views to the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor it at any location .
the current window view can be saved with View window arrangement ... save . a dialog is displayed in which you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 current . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 .
to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ ders icon in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry View scene rendering .
a render mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or select View R@@ ender modes in the View menu , the following dialog will be opened :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but meaningful is a name that lets you recognize the features of the mode .
in the card size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the picture , select the section of the sub@@ section and enter the picture cut for rendering in the input fields .
in combination field quality , you can select the characteristics that &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray are used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection lighting . you can find a detailed description of the rendering properties in the user &apos;s manual to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel , various errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or tier effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not shown when they are less than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to decrease the impact of these errors . generally , pictures with this feature look better .
when you switch on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tively because the super @-@ sampling reads the adjacent pixels . the second method is adaptive , recur@@ sively because each pixel is divided further and further , because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated colour values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a beam per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the specified threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4 will be calculated , at a depth value of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference then is :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are further followed and tested for further sub@@ divisions . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is to reduce the generation of noise for the jet process called J@@ it@@ tering . when you switch on it@@ tering , changes &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection calcul@@ ates . it takes very long to let a scene calculate with this feature .
on this map you can specify whether the alpha @-@ channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding rays have not hit an object .
opens a new window for displaying &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly terminated , you can find the reason here .
to import one &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; import the scene file , select File Im@@ porting ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet complete the complete command set by &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if error messages or warnings occur when im@@ porting , a dialog box displays a list of all messages .
if you do not want to support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er , write this source code between the two particular comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the object code to the opened text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can paste source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene rendering . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on help in property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation for the displayed object . here you can find the path to your retention and version . supported are versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. height field data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the scene file , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates .
you can set the object capture of the points to the grid in the contex@@ tual menu of the wire model views . here you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the detail level separately for two directions .
when you check high detail accuracy for extended projections , all wire model views will be further divided if the camera uses an extended projection . extended projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections . this feature gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time to render .
when you cross a wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors .
when viewing the bottom , a bottom is rendered below the objects . the floor is represented in a check@@ er@@ board pattern consisting of two adjustable colours .
if you tick edge smoo@@ thing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value . details on the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section .
on this page you can modify existing window orders or create new window orders . in the window orders section it is explained how to create and save window orders .
the standard window arrangement : displays all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window arrangement at the start of the program .
the list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders . a new arrangement allows you to create with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Del@@ ete button .
every window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views for the chosen window arrangement . you can create new views using the Add button and delete selected views with the Del@@ ete button .
the position of the new window . with New column create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten anchor the window under the existing window , with tab card you get a flash@@ card view together with the previous view and floating in the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start with no more detailed knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene among beginners : a ball on one level .
but you should keep in mind the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should follow these important rules :
if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules for rendering can be applied , as a result you get a black picture .
if you don &apos;t insert light sources , your entire scene lies in the dark and you get only a black picture .
if you have installed everything flaw@@ lessly , you will see at the first launch of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following set of windows :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the icons of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation to get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols so often , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
to follow this tutorial , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select Edit Del@@ ete . now you have a scene without objects .
the wi@@ re@@ model view shows how the camera views the whole scene you create . in particular note that in the fourth wi@@ re@@ model view ( right bottom ) . this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the content of the view properties , in which you can find the different parameters of the camera . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for more details .
change nothing to the basic settings of the camera , this is subject to later instructions , but note that the camera in view has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera . just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location .
if you use the App@@ ly button or paste button , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the point of view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . you could , for example , insert a box ( insert final body Qu@@ ader ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually provides a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
a good advice : select the layer in the object tree , change the name and then press the App@@ ly button or enter the button . in the object tree , the new name is immediately displayed .
the wire model view now also shows the level , albeit at the moment only as a fin@@ ite infinite plane . if you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon .
when you look at the object tree , you will find that you can fold the item for the bottom when you click on the + in front of the object . in this case , you will see only the default options for each new object . in this case , you will see only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shifting . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the property properties .
in this scene you should move the floor to the exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select Shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment select something simple .
in both cases , a dialog opens where you can select how the object should be inserted . please select first sub @-@ object . the pigment will then be displayed in the property tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom @-@ pig@@ ments ) , with a click on the button preview you can see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the preview of the pig@@ ments shows only a matt black material because you still have to enter settings for the pigment . please always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview .
if you don &apos;t see any color on the box and sphere in the preview , just click the App@@ ly button and then go to the Pre@@ view .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
in the color list you have to enter two new attributes , called single @-@ color . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more often , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , select single @-@ color each time and change the colors in the view of the property properties :
this step should be done simply because you should have understood the basic mode of working of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be created just as easily as the floor :
in the view of the property properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget to press the input button or the App@@ ly button ) , so the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground as you moved the floor around one unit down@@ wards .
of course rendering now a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . in the next step , put a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already on the floor , give the ball a pigment as color :
select first sub @-@ object and change the name for example in sphere pigment . click on Sphere Pig@@ ment , then choose colored and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finishing features :
then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots and click App@@ ly or press En@@ ter .
the brightness effects and reflections already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrom@@ ed surfaces , even if metal : not yet selected :
you should now have a good idea of the possibilities for you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ ing is a rendering method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected by the objects and how atmospheric effects such as fog work . thus , the scene is processed pixel for pixels .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you don &apos;t see anything , the picture is simply black . obviously , any scene that should be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file is inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest item in the list .
if you already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you will need to enter a name and disk space .
reco@@ vers the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you do not have saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last rever@@ sible command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used edit undo .
saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new layout or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for setting up &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , short@@ cut and default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can use this option to change the default short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; modify commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up tool bars . you can use this option to add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; commands .
a b@@ ump map is a way to simul@@ ate rough surfaces without having to model each b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both a b@@ ump mapping as well as a texture map .
basic elements are simple geometric shapes that can be used as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis by applying an image file as color card .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that can be displayed by clicking the &amp; L@@ M@@ B@@ n ; or the Return key .
you can specify whether each image is to be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are searching for a specific file , just type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right bottom corner . if a matching file name is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing return or &amp; Es@@ c ;
in Dialog Bin@@ ding - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can adjust the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; in the other two , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts for the respective windows can be specified .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color , which you can set further down . default is not full@@ screen mode .
this point activ@@ ates , loads &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; already the next image in the folder , while you are still looking at the current image . this reduces the delay if you select the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slide show .
with this option stores &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; at exit the name of the last opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bars to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is bigger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can create &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; just set up that only some of the file types are displayed , which can also display the program .
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
specify whether the slideshow should start with the first image in the folder or the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows on the right of the input field . default is 3 seconds .
the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show is repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows on the right of the input field . the default is 1 .
here you can change the short@@ cuts for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the fil@@ esystem with folders and files in a window .
displays large symbols for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays preview images for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
the picture is reduced by 10 % . the factor relates to the current size of the image .
the picture enlar@@ ges by 10 % . the factor relates to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; will also be closed if no browser window is opened anymore .
show the image in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ file ; image editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image editing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; a &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user to contribute his part to at least problems and possible improvements .
show a dialog with a link . if you are using it , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . if you use it , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ photo ; then we want to encourage you to ask questions to other users of &amp; show@@ photo ; however , in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
the best start to join &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; .
&amp; show@@ photo ; try to give you so much control over his work steps as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ photo ; to access these settings , you need to set up settings in the Settings menu . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side .
in the area of exposure indicators you can select the color that is displayed if the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display the colors with what you are supposed to display . under@@ exposure should display a light color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of show@@ photo ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge , providing important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same side@@ bar in image editing . you can view it in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that no longer makes pictures to scan and store images .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that no longer makes them scan and save images . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for saving each image or save images immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format .
you can check the status of support of your scanner on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line from &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner can not be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner to be used and press OK to open the scanner . cancel &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; exit .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) do not treat these options particularly .
to scan an image , the user can only start a preview scan and then select the scanning area for the final scan . the preview button is started by the preview button .
to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . he can also adjust the zoom so that the complete preview fits in the window .
when the image is selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if a preview is displayed in the settings before saving , the image will be displayed in a preview window as shown below . if saving is pressed , the image will be saved and par@@ lie ? en leads to a demo@@ lition and you will get back to the main window .
the Settings button opens the dialogue with the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image , if desired , before saving . in this case , the option before saving has to be selected . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows you to select the type like &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images can be selected . open dialog for saving each image opens the dialog before each scann@@ ed image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; this will automatically store it with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are saved on the Save button without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder is used as default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this using the button ... Change .
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically storing images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically stored image gets a numerical suff@@ ix that is highly numbered every time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the Help button starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE about dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the button Settings shows the dialog for Settings and Cl@@ ose can be used to finish &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; use like all other programs keyboard short@@ cuts . below is a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global keyboard short@@ cuts can be set up by right @-@ clicking on the player window and clicking on Global button short@@ cuts . you can set up the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ specific keyboard short@@ cuts you can set by right @-@ clicking in the player window and select Quick commands ... Select .
you may want to set existing multimedia keys so that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands . by doing this , make your keyboard a &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions , most of which can be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browsers , players , playlist , playlist browsers and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; additionally Amar@@ ok has some own command @-@ line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be run because of a missing depen@@ dency . please check in your script whether all required modules are present and use the k@@ dialog so that the user knows why a script does not run .
start require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE b@@ ind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy .
using D@@ CO@@ P , you can exchange your scripts with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in any K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages enable exec@@ uting external programs and commands . in this way , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively simply . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends al@@ erts to all running scripts . for this , strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore the events if there is no use for it .
configure Wei@@ st the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok puts the working folder on the folder where all the data should be stored .
tra@@ ck@@ Change signals that a new piece is played . the script could now ask &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions further information about the new piece ( for example the metadata or the piece length ) .
volume Change new@@ volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths Inclu@@ des the path to the selected files of the playlist , when a user @-@ defined menu entry is cli@@ cked . to remove an entry , you can use the d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script called d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , for example storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages which the user &amp; z@@ b has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be downloaded with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the creation of cat@@ ech@@ o@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages right right .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file per@@ missions :
if your script package is completed , you can place it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki script page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps , you should use the Amar@@ ok page ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can easily drag music into the playlist , instead of having to work through endless menus . perhaps you will find only a very specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece in seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then , the play@@ lists browser is the right one for you . and if the decision is still difficult , select dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . furthermore , many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right one to experience your music new !
usually , in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources you have to enter the following to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have any trouble when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that can be activated or de@@ activated at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the compile options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the system requirements section .
activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you wish to help in developing &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without effort over the installation dialog . the installation dialog has several flash@@ cards for setting up the different functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
to display player windows , the player window will turn on or off the playlist . if the option is off , only the play@@ lists window will be displayed .
use the tuning bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
design more atmospheric : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this changes the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer .
putting voice files in the music files : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; Amar@@ ok should be started when a browser is needed .
other browsers : here you can specify the path to a different browser which is not in the list above .
save Play@@ list when you exit , save the current playlist automatically when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok , and enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist .
relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; use relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , otherwise the absolute position of music files is stored .
to make up @-@ to @-@ date pieces visible when changing the piece causes the play@@ lists to pop up / un@@ roll to keep the current piece in the visible window area .
when changing to the context @-@ browser , the context @-@ browser automatically switches to the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can adjust &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the font section , you can set up the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok . by marking own fonts , the otherwise grey section is activated . you can select fonts for the following area : play@@ lists Window , Player window , and context Browser . click Select ... so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can define your own color scheme . to do so , use the color selection sel@@ ector for foreground and background color .
continue playing when starting , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start the play continues automatically with the piece at the point with which it was stopped at the last stop .
the On @-@ Screen display sub@@ window allows you to turn on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is checked , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be displayed in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors gives you the option to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . clicking on the color surfaces opens the dialog for color sel@@ ections . if your own colors are not checked , the default colors will be used .
the display text input field introduces the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your own needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ in@@ ama users . this allows you to specify on which screen of a multiple monitor environment the O@@ SD is to appear .
the card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers still activate more settings in this card .
the card collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of the database for the collection .
here you can select the folders &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , mark the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes for setting up how to proceed with the selected folders .
Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the scann@@ ed and their sub@@ folders will search for music .
monitor changes : allow &amp; Amar@@ ok to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. add or delete music files ) . also , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to add all found play@@ lists to your collections ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists then appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
the portion of the collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the drop down driver : allows you to choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setup is required in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l configuration section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; under Calcul@@ ator : will the host enter where the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that , the network port is entered under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use username : and password : to enter the data required to connect to the database .
the cart@@ on card last@@ .@@ f@@ m establishes the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can send the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations for the current piece if necessary .
enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send played pieces and update the profile : this setting enables &amp; Amar@@ ok to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok needs only the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs contained therein , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) .
some functions such as the O@@ SD assume that your window manager will keep the relevant standards from fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will cause trouble . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because they provide an excellent development environment .
you can locate the file by searching in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also attach the broken file that caused the crash .
it is mostly because Tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this causes crash when editing the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then de@@ activate autom@@ . turn off when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use at least 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens at a crash ) . if it is a common crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed .
this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ info , but do not mark them as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script solves the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Mist@@ akes when writing the tags from $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl @-@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( access mode / repetition / dynamic playlist ) always look active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects are simply forgotten . note that in some cases , you need to click on a symbol until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : trademark look@@ up error : trademark look@@ up error : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check whether Amar@@ ok will use the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ an@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to correct this bug , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or modify / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the right version first .
there are several possibilities . most installation problems clarify the easiest way through the help of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please only enter a fault if you find something to fix a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only a blank playlist appeared . how do music pieces come in there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the Start sub@@ window has been converted to the stati@@ stic window . you will find it under Extras Statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the rating by the user , while the points are calculated automatically .
to rate pieces , the playlist has to be displayed in the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and select column view rating . click anywhere in the new application column to specify the rating for a piece . you can also use the short@@ cuts Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or right click on your selection , then select from Play@@ list to remove from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file into the playlist with the mouse and drop it there , just like you would do with other files . that &apos;s how easy it is : - )
in the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , right next to the Add button , the button Play@@ list is located . click on it .
probably the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config is missing . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . look also for lib@@ visual , this package contains many nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it using the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no ! yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one of the back@@ end independent approach so the real question is What media types supports G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support pretty much every imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and p@@ ng !
it can ! perhaps use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which is not included in the default MP3 decoder ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 node , input button
launch the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well , so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s off : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device has to provide a mixer . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ live ) or by the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( Software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you to find the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify another sink ( for example , the sink sink ) .
you can &apos;t just send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would just listen to a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people , if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Sound@@ server with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure the ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper su@@ id is set :
K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x solves problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia code@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this bug report . enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either you don &apos;t use the Arts driver but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts @-@ Code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts @-@ buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less iner@@ tia react the visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; why ?
after you have installed G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all the components . run @-@ register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask in the I@@ RC channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( finish Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then execute all ff@@ m@@ peg files , once as system administrator and once as your normal user . then delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module folder .
please report to bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a complete list of suggestions , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm perform this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command leaves &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before going to bed , then you will be arous@@ ed by the soft tones of the music you have stopped before going to bed .
how to get to know the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running tracks if you are on another computer ?
if there is a working SSH environment , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the running piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usability rite Amar@@ ok player now@@ Air@@ ing
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes your identification is present in ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ R@@ SA file .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; click on the keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer will open in an independent window in the size changeable window .
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + Right mouse button displays a piece in the click sequence in the queue . by pressing the button after searching the playlist , the first search result will be played and the search returns .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tricky functions , but what about the symbol in the system section of the control bar ?
click &amp; R@@ M@@ B@@ n ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browser you want to display .
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is located on an NFS drive . after the launch of Amar@@ ok , the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click on Audio CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic coding , you can instead take files from the folders mp3 or o@@ gg .
Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( Esc@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ;
basically , this corresponds to the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the play has been played . the more often the play has been played , the less influence each individual rating has on the overall score .
you can enter the evaluation for a piece by right @-@ clicking on a column header in the play@@ lists window . then you can change the evaluation of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by right @-@ clicking on the piece , selecting Edit : select or press F@@ 2 . you can also edit the review in the metadata dialog .
the developers do not want you to specify when you want to release a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a specified publication plan that is not to be combined with the planned Amar@@ ok plan .
this is a new function in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find annoying . de@@ activate the option symbol when playing in the General Settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings tool bars ... and take the desired changes there .
download a design , or create your own . then install it under Amar@@ ok ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance context @-@ browser @-@ design , click New Design ...
the icon was too similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties , it was removed .
Kon@@ quer@@ ors navigation section allows you to monitor and control &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while browsing in the Kon@@ quer@@ or . start Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation pane . then click the Settings button ( the top ) and select Add Amar@@ ok in the drop @-@ down menu .
audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler can be sent to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free username and password . audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler will be fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
if you would like to use AL@@ SA then please use the latest version available . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore a lot of bug reports .
presumably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before installing x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine has not compiled these output modules . you must re@@ configure and install Amar@@ ok .
now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ?
you probably need to install a distribution that separates the development files from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , you will need to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel package . the same is true for x@@ ine , you must install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel .
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without p@@ rel@@ inking . a tip by mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : use no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module must also be installed in addition to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad .
they get the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play an MP3 stream , but the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad module is not installed . install the module and then run it as a system administrator . then restart Amar@@ ok .
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can Amar@@ ok use the second sound card ?
set up settings Amar@@ ok ... Audio output you specify the device . typical is h@@ w : 0 for the default sound@@ card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 code@@ c and a USB audio device :
p@@ c@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
in the setup dialog of x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio and output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of converting the sample rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , des@@ elect the tick on sound@@ card supports m@@ map .
sorry , but the audio output with Arts will not be taken care of . you can of course take this issue yourself ! if you would like , you can become the new urgently needed advisor for Arts : )
listen to music should be quite simple ! for this reason you have the setup wizard , which will appear at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to upgrade your collection afterwards , or simply do not like the wizard , this Quick Start Guide will be a help . with your help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes .
creating a playlist is very simple . drag entries from the collection browser into the playlist . the small text box to filter the collection makes it easier to search for certain pieces . if you &apos;re happy with the playlist , you can save them with the help of the playlist to save them . you &apos;ll find this button in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ lists window .
if you have own play@@ lists , you can add them to the play@@ lists browser . if the playlist is included in your collection , and you have the option to import play@@ lists , you can already find these play@@ lists in the tree view . with a right @-@ click on a playlist , you will find various ways to load the playlist .
to play an audio CD , select the Audio CD in the menu bar . it opens up a file browser with multiple folders and CD pieces in WAV format . simply drag the wa@@ v files to the playlist and then press the button Play@@ back .
the audio CD function uses the protocol audio CD : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . just click on an entry with the right mouse button and follow the burning menu . here you have several options for burning a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . in addition , some additional packages are listed , making work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more pleasant .
if you install these packages via a pack@@ et management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you also need to install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player has also &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important functions . in addition , has a playlist that is superior to all others . the play@@ lists window contains several browsers that allow you to capture and browse your entire music collection .
this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok are used , including creating a collection and playlist .
the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window is a running text display showing the current piece or the currently running stream . right underneath is the area , the playing time , bit rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current play . a click on this area will change the display of the already expi@@ red playing time for the remaining play time of the piece .
in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , even under the running text display . you can switch from the available analy@@ zer by right @-@ clicking on the pane .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer will be displayed in an independent , magni@@ fied window .
the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also located under the running text . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the play@@ lists window , while the E@@ Q button is used to set equ@@ ali@@ zers .
the rest of the player window consists of the play buttons , the volume control and the piece @-@ position slider . use the slider to adjust the play position or the volume . with the play buttons you can start / stop playback , and switch to the next or previous piece .
using the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets .
to display the equ@@ ali@@ zer use extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the Player window . once you select the check box E@@ quali@@ zer , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation .
the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all available multimedia players . it has many features that do not exist in any other player . but don &apos;t let the abundance of functions deter them , they &apos;re all easy to use .
you can split the play@@ lists in two main areas , on the left hand side of the navigation pane . in the navigation pane you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context browser .
the context browser shows different information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser designs . the context browser contains three sub @-@ windows : music , text and interpreter . these three sub @-@ windows will later be replaced in detail .
if you have previously used previous versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you might notice that the sub@@ window will take off . the information presented there is now divided into other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . besides , the information can be collected in the statistics window ( extras statistics ) .
the music sub@@ window displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the interpreter and the album .
the first section in this sub @-@ window shows information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you will see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to track the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol you will find more information about the current piece . you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its assessment .
to display cover images in context browsers , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the images may have any name , but pictures with the word front in the name are preferred . the context browser will also display covers images that were downloaded either with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on any of these pieces , it will be played right away .
among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this interpreter . this section shows the five highest score pieces of the current interpreter .
you can set which information is to be displayed in the music sub @-@ window . right @-@ click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be opened and you will see the content of the album .
you can click all pieces in each area to start playing immediately . you can also right @-@ click on it and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
in the text sub @-@ window , the downloaded song text is displayed for the current piece . this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts written from other web pages using the help of self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the internet . if there is no text script running , you can choose which to be started .
the Edit button will allow you to edit the lyrics . the modified version will then be saved in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . there is no running text script required .
the Search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com based on the lyrics for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - only groups the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or genres are ignored .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - First , the pieces are sorted according to the artist and there will be another distribution according to the respective album . if you want to see compositions or soundtrack @-@ albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list with various interpre@@ ters .
group Artist / Year - Album - Sor@@ ted by Interpre@@ t and then after the year of the album in descending order ( newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is used .
group@@ ing album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically by each other . the performer will be ignored .
group@@ ing genre / interpreter - your pieces are sorted by genre and sorted by performer .
group@@ ing genre / interpreter / album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter .
you can adjust and combine the group@@ ing at will by means of the remaining buttons .
with the last knob you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically re@@ count your collection once you change something to the selected folders . if you have many pieces , this might take a while .
a search filter is located right under the tool@@ bar . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . notes on how to use this filter can be found in the section about the playlist in this manual .
below the search filter there is a drop @-@ down sel@@ ector with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . there are different time frames available , starting from the last 24 hours to one year .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will receive the following options .
load - This le@@ ds the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in the play .
app@@ end to playlist - Ad@@ ds the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you will achieve the same effect .
set pieces in queue . this function adds the selected pieces to the queue . as a result , you will be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list should be stored .
transfer to media player - add the pieces to the queue to transfer to the media player . see section about the Media Player Browser for more details .
burn all pieces of this interpreter / Bur@@ n CD - This will send the selected pieces to K@@ 3@@ b and burn either as a data or as an audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not be displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Op@@ ens the dialogue for piece information and lets you change tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) Move files into the garbage bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
mark the compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation , which causes various interpre@@ ters to appear .
up@@ lift compilation - Chan@@ ges a record marked as a compilation album back to a normal album . after that , the album will no longer be displayed in different interpre@@ ters but again under the corresponding interpreter .
the play@@ lists browser makes dealing with many play@@ lists quite simple . among other things , it also includes intelligent play@@ lists .
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played yet .
even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click on Smart Play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the Media Player sub@@ window is used for connection from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; using your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok , it must be included before starting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod by interpreter sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them drop them on the list . if you are done , click App@@ ly . thus , the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . if the transfer is complete , quit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and solve the drive binding for your iPod .
under the tool@@ bar there is a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is particularly useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser you find an address bar with which you can get music from a entered URL . if you enter tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z , you can access music in the musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z file . now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files can be difficult by simple case dropping . in this case , the holding down of the Shift key can be helpful : by doing so , dropped files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
the playlist contains all the items you have to play . you can change the order by simply moving the entries with the mouse to the desired location . as soon as you enter letters , only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed . to reset the filter , press the button until the text box is empty again .
if you enter search terms separated by whit@@ esp@@ ace , search &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all search terms . for example , if you enter one or two , the search will find all entries containing one , two and three .
for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces containing one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) are found .
if you want to search for entries containing whit@@ esp@@ ace , then close the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will look for entries that include Mike Old@@ field , but not after entries like Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a particular search column , you can look for bigger or smaller . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a particular search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain something .
you can combine these syntax variants at will . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this looks for all the pieces that contain either Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment pool .
you can specify the order sequence of entries by holding down the C@@ tr@@ l key and clicking on the entries with the right mouse button . the entries will then be marked with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the tool@@ bar &apos;s tool@@ bar is located at the bottom of the playlist . it contains buttons for some of the playlist functions . on the left , you will find the Add button to add play@@ lists to the playlist . to the right , you can save playlist , empty play@@ lists , and Rand@@ om folders .
next , the buttons will follow back and restore . this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the tool@@ bar there is a unique , magni@@ fied Analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be set by right mouse button on the analy@@ zer .
the last button in the tool@@ bar is a menu . it opens the same menu as the one you see in the player window above the right mouse button . you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s configuration via this menu .
there are many more buttons available for the tool@@ bar , for example ren@@ ditions and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on menu and setting up tool@@ bars .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of useful information about the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and recovery , a slider for the playing position and the playing time of the current play are displayed .
you can also hide the status bar . to do so , disable the status bar option in the General Settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the menu in the playlist . using this menu , you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
a click on this entry will open the window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ ins . there you can select visu@@ al@@ isations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
behind this entry is a sub@@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start it by selecting action cover management in the collection browser .
the cover management includes a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the performer on the left .
with the View menu you can choose what to display in the cover administration . select from :
the queue management received your big collection in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this function you have even more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece in the queue , the playlist will appear next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the plays are played : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on .
if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces to the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are pre @-@ specified ( the details to set up these later ) .
fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds more random pieces while playing .
add pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audio @-@ Stro@@ bler ) . this mode requires that there are already some pieces in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile for this dynamic playlist to work .
double @-@ click the playlist you want , drag them to the play@@ lists window , or right @-@ click on them and then choose loading . this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist .
the two pre @-@ set Mo@@ di Zu@@ fäl@@ lige Mix and Play@@ list Mix immediately fill in your playlist and you can start playing directly . the play@@ lists will be added to the next piece change , so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the last possible dynamic mode : setting Dynamic Mode . this will use your existing playlist as the starting point . in the same menu entry , dynamic mode can also be de@@ activated .
the New fill le@@ ds the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . edit playlist opens the dialog to edit the playlist , and you can change the settings .
right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist allows you to click Edit to edit . then , the dialog to edit the playlist settings will pop up .
enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will grow continuously , the setting for upcoming pieces will be ignored and you will not hear a piece twice in this playlist . if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed with respect to the settings played .
played pieces - this is the number of played pieces to be kept at the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see which pieces were recently played .
this is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist by each played piece . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will grow continuously , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the Settings on the right @-@ hand side has been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you tick more than one playlist , add &amp; Amar@@ ok ; random pieces from each of the play@@ lists you have crossed .
some scripts make your own settings . you can adjust the settings by starting the script and then clicking on Set@@ ting .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; scripts by clicking on the script . it will open a dialog where a script package will be installed for installation . after you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts from the Internet .
if you no longer want to use a script , you can delete it . to do so , select the script to be deleted and then click Un@@ install .
if you are looking for information about writing your own scripts , please refer to the writing of scripts .
the dialog window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ ins is used to activate the available visu@@ al@@ isations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plu@@ gins . to use a plugin , simply activate the check box next to the name .
this Quick Start should show you how to create an audio CD in four steps . to understand the steps , you need to have a running installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog window where you can choose which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD from MP3 s or other los@@ sy compressed formats , remember that you will get a worse quality when encoding to MP3 , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created by a los@@ sy format . use the au@@ c@@ t@@ ect project .
in this dialog window , you can do nothing . please wait until the computer has finished the burning process .
this Quick Start is intended to show you how to copy a data CD in just four steps . in order to understand the steps , you must have a running installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have and the source CD inserted into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
to copy a data CD , please choose Extras , copy CD ... from the menu . you will now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning .
after you &apos;ve made all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; settings , please press the Start button . you now see a dialog box that looks like this :
in this dialog window you can track the progress of the copy process . once you have finished reading the original into the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium to burn the data .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you have to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you have to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
the Q@@ T Designer tool U@@ IC can &apos;t find the &amp; k@@ de ; Wid@@ get modules . to fix this problem start q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / li@@ b / K@@ DE@@ 3 / plu@@ gins to the search path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS by your base folder from &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
the website of k@@ 3@@ b ; can be found at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org , where you get the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you can also get feedback from the forums and learn about news .
if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in one run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the features that also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; hence sel@@ ects &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases it reaches &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality for burnt audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . on the Internet such programs are generally called Ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a fully open , patent @-@ free and professional audio coding technology and for handling audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from Open Source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and enco@@ der modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers , Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 Decoder module .
l@@ ame : a well @-@ developed MP3 Decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 enco@@ der module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code@@ c for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio enco@@ der module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : other libraries for processing various audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg , for example , it is possible to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : an auxiliary program that can convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio Enco@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video editing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a full featured author system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs .
standard : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can , for example , make sense to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without seri@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ attractive effect that the music pieces are played differently lou@@ dly .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically play all the videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient method of re@@ loading recently opened projects . the related sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . clicking on an entry will open the project .
saves the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name .
save the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s Di@@ alogue Save As is shown , with which you can choose folder and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file .
stores all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each single project file Save .
closes the current project . if a project changes and has not been saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what will happen . you can then disc@@ ard between saving and changes . you can also cancel the project and keep the project open .
includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for each un@@ saved project what to do with it , just as if you had called for each project file .
closes all opened projects and finishes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project you will be asked what to do with it , as if you had called a file .
when you access this entry , you can select files to add to the project through the appearing dialog . that will have the same effect as if you put the files directly from the top view into the Project View . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD .
opens the dialog &quot; Bur@@ ning &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the Project Properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make a lot of project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described using the What is the ? help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry will only appear with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful when you are not using files for a multiple session CD . it is intended for you rather than help , so that you can see the files and folders already present on the medium .
this entry will only appear with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removes any files from the medium , it only hides the previously imported files .
this allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can also create one copy of a CD , which you can then burn later . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
this allows you to copy DVD to another medium even without a project file . alternatively , you can also create one copy of a DVD , which you can then burn later on . besides , converting / decreasing a DVD with the help of copying is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to be able to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in its original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete all contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD + R ( W ) , which will completely delete the contents . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
burns a previously created CD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burn button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools like N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burns a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burn button .
a previously used DVD video can be converted . this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used as stand@@ alone . it contains information about the selected video , encoding settings , and even possibilities for changing the size and cut black margins .
displays information about the included medium . this information is displayed in the content view and includes features of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is checked , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is ti@@ cked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view contains an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , its contents will be displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as Media info , locks and blocking of the drive or ej@@ ecting media .
the content view allows selection and drag of files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
the header is a narrow section that is only visible if the project view contains open projects . the header has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog to change the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the keyboard layout to the bottom .
this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are required , so you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when you start the wizard .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here you can set general program settings . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should function strai@@ gh@@ ta@@ way . this dialog is for person@@ al@@ ising and fine adjustment of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many others &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can , for example , be controlled by a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the slightly more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so it is more of your taste and the type of task that the included programs give you the default .
in this chapter , we assume that you can use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; program in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts that are described below .
the Standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and other features for creating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD Project ( ) void copy@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void release bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void release bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface that can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String Name , Q@@ String desig@@ nd void add@@ Ur@@ ls ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String Current Name ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then inserts files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audio creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ Read for &amp; k@@ de ; with it you can easily record audio CD ; s can be read out and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on the enco@@ der that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard drive ) and by many coding which enco@@ des these WAV files ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) by default ( these enco@@ der packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . more enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD are read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these wa@@ v files ( usually one per cap@@ tion ) are compressed into the MP3 or O@@ GG format or other formats like the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , it is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must now be done .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . all of these programs are usually available for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is very likely not necessary to install something yourself . however , if FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required .
which enco@@ der / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ver gives a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as I said already , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to b@@ ypass some copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device does not cover the protection , it is not possible to b@@ ypass the mechanism of copy protection . simply avoid buying copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only once ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , the daily handling to read a &amp; CD will be explained on the hard disk . this leads ( hopefully ) to the understanding of the lean approach of the user interface , which you will stum@@ ble frequently at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without a network , where everything is manually captured .
this is just a short list of the main window commands . step by step example you will find more information about how this program is used , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for configur@@ ing the program .
starting the C@@ DD@@ B request of the CD @-@ data according to the setup of request in the C@@ DD@@ B tab . ( this may be local or online , in the latter case must first connect to the Internet . )
start the reading and - if an enco@@ der has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the directive - the encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders so that the selection can be read with a different enco@@ der than the default . it should be noted that before the enco@@ der has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog .
opens the File Manager , so that an already read @-@ out file is selected to code rather than a full &amp; CD ; read and code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as logs , pi@@ p@@ ses ) for program events ( such as reading &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main installation dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with various flash@@ cards ( such as Enco@@ der , for setting the enco@@ der ) . here you need to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression rates and helps you choose the right enco@@ der .
if no audio information is to be lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is required . in addition to FLA@@ C there are also others such as &apos; gre@@ ats &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psycho@@ acousti@@ cal model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate the differences become less important as both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless supplied with most distri@@ butions free of charge , but there are open license questions
+ High to very high sound quality ( at high bit rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG easily lower quality at lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG plays is present .
MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto stereo devices . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly support only the MP3 format .
a short list of audio quality parameters and the resulting compression ratios for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the play . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . requires 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a titanium . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate approx . 11 128 k@@ bps for all tracks of a title . good En@@ ough for music by young people , portable devices and auto @-@ stere@@ os . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have absolutely highest quality regardless of the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information entered manually or fet@@ ched automatically from fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / use with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD title to the keywords ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title must be added to &amp; k@@ audio creator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; parameters needed ( = button description in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database in which people can read the audio CDs that you can download / enter , so that all others can download this information instead of yourself into the computer . it is to be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not by the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translator ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; information that is publicly available on the CD ; and in addition , the information without the &amp; CD ; no more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . any information can anyway be obtained at a stroll through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address than the specified in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears that the e @-@ mail address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( This can only know the programmer who has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if you use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval from &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only updates to the database .
which extract program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in wa@@ v files on my computer ?
there are ru@@ mo@@ urs that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more exactly , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not happened yet .
to save the selected WAV files , the enco@@ der and thus the desired file format can be selected . at first opening are pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab to set the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab itself .
the enco@@ der package must be installed from the Linux distribution in question before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for the pre @-@ defined enco@@ ders . more information about enco@@ ders can be found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ver .
after installing a enco@@ der , more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , write and read real on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you don &apos;t want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check the cover of the &amp; CD ; this won &apos;t work !
there is a chapter with one step by step example . even if you are using other settings , this can give you tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood all , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) .
you need to have c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame may be found using a search engine , as it is considered as non @-@ free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can do of course .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission ( eg ; trying to copy something into it ) .
the first section covers the basic setting of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , something that is probably done only once and
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each reading &amp; CD ;
here we determine the enco@@ der to use for compression of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them at any time you read a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is passed to the output program so it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , a look inside the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the tab General Settings . here is not much to do . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything will be left / typ@@ ed as shown in the screen@@ shot .
only In case of incomplete information contact us , so that you will be informed if information on the creation of keywords ( tags ) is missing .
the card card CD ; settings . just select both entries . we are comfortable and leave the &amp; CD ; data can be downloaded automatically via the internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet during reading the &amp; CD , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second sel@@ ector is easier to find a &amp; CD ; entry will start immediately the reading of the &amp; CD ; if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can be easily changed . the directory or file name is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or@@ - &gt; Ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to manually enter everything manually , de@@ activate the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not work . you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to use the database beforehand . however , if you want to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two sel@@ ections must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following map .
C@@ DD@@ B is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for calling &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b .
mode : we did not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
C@@ DD@@ B @-@ Server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server near you . on this path the load between the hosts is distributed . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work at the same time as the server , but since many fire@@ walls are running the 88@@ 80 protocol by default , there might be more luck with the protocol 80 , because the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet .
in this example we do not want to send &amp; CD ; data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . disable the first check box .
simply take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the / tmp directory exists on your computer )
number simultaneously : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author does not know , so simply try yourself .
CD ; after reading the last piece , check this to check out the CD ; at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must be specified the path / folder in which the wa@@ v files are stored . if the box is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget to use this folder if you want to do something with the wa@@ v files yourself .
enter everything as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , some may need to fl@@ atten something to the right to see everything .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems sufficient . the resulting compression factor is approximately 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the creation of tags to Version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including full path ) and output file ( including full path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneously to enco@@ ded WAV files : at a dual core or qu@@ ad or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to code more than one WAV file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic set of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; quit . this configuration is used as default for each reading a &amp; CD ; if you have clever@@ ly chosen the organizational structure of your music , you will never need to change it again .
in this section is described how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; on hard disk runs off . we will create and setup MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on hard disk , was built in the previous section , because we want to pick up data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each read &amp; CD ;
since we use one &amp; CD ; the screen@@ shots look a little different from those for one &amp; CD ; with successfully logged data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data will be manually entered rather than picking it out of the internet . comments will point to the differences .
do not try the &amp; CD ; this example is to be found . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this is not yet done , now the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as shown in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , check the section Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers section for help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully collected by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and the album will be shown .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; a window appears and you can select the database entry that best matches your opinion on your &amp; CD ;
if you have not selected the check box for automatic query from fre@@ ed@@ b ( on page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have a local database , but get the data from the internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 2 : the CD @-@ Editor - input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; Current titles &apos; input field , the rest of the data in the &apos; Album &apos; input field .
the artist no longer has to be entered in the &apos; Current titles &apos; input field unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ ally per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that are common to all pieces of the CD .
note : after successful retri@@ eval of data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD Editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the screen@@ shot below . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor , so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words with capital letters start or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment field . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least at what &amp; k@@ audio creator ; this option is set to the Code tab .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also recre@@ ate ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see help with the enco@@ der to get more information .
simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the selected CD ; in this example it is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . the title of the piece in any case and other information you want .
click the next row in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the list .
note that it has a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece , or select the All pieces selected at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once .
was started by clicking on the selection clause of the reading process , so this window appears for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what &apos;s going on .
click on the Ri@@ der Or@@ ders to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , right under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to check the jobs . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message can be seen when trying to work with a code that you haven &apos;t installed yet . pieces that have not been successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error oc@@ cured directly after the end of reading the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 in the format MP3 . thus , read@@ out and coding are parallel . note the status message in the bottom of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding . the computer used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 doesn &apos;t seem to have a problem with simultaneous reading and coding ( of course two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read out while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third assignment is written in the queue of the enco@@ der . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window will appear with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice .
if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . however , most distri@@ butions provide a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you &apos;re reading this , you probably already have done it ...
this section is addressed to people compiled from source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help , how the program can be adapted to your needs when it &apos;s running , then the following is correct for you :
a program that calls on many different programs has many different settings . the best way to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen@@ shots of different card flash@@ cards and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
Hi , still am reading ? even if only the Help menu was cli@@ cked on after the first start of the program , without any indication of how it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD in the drive at the time of program starts ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? who reads this has probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately , no email . the author can not maintain this manual . it is the first version for a manual for &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; intended . whoever wants to add or change something useful , may do it . and if you read this , he has left this section and therefore agrees with this suggestion .
strange , if you have managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; ist der MI@@ DI@@ - und Kara@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er von &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke ju@@ x@@ tap@@ osition of texts also has some features that others &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver that is required for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ en@@ cer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag and drop so that you can drag and drop any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Windows to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text into MIDI files ( real @-@ time or text events ) .@@ k@@ mid will automatically determine the used method .
session support . if you end &amp; k@@ de ; quit while playing a song , k@@ mid will start playing with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog , with which you can select the song you want .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to the &amp; k@@ mid ; this works also with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the tool@@ bar , select the entry from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts as soon as you draw it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( in several pieces you will be added to a collection and then played back to each other . )
once &amp; k@@ mid , play a piece , you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and driving with the slider back and forth .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of the tempo indicator and thus change the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar acts as a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the piece , so interrup@@ ts the playback . press the space key while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics event and others use both . some pieces have no text at all : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set what events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically retri@@ eved , which is used for a song , so that you don &apos;t have to adjust anything manually . so , if you select the automatic text selection in the Settings menu , the kar@@ aoke text is automatically selected . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to specify a type of event type , select from the Settings menu the entries text events or song events . the same function also has the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that summ@@ ari@@ ze you . in this section you will see how you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . this can be found in the collection under the point Organ@@ ize . click New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copy and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . in the beginning , this collection will contain the same songs as the original ones .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the rights in the collection manager .
the temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when you exit the application , this collection will not be saved . remember that when you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the Add button . it appears again the file dialog , with which you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on the setting Automatic adding to the collection .
when automatic adding to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) .
when Automati@@ cally adds to the collection , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then add the un@@ opened pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the sub@@ menu pick @-@ up sequence of the menus collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection .
when you add or remove songs , or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to jump a song , select the button Next song , the entry next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right .
to return a song to vice versa , select the button preceding piece , the entry preceding piece from the menu item or press the arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter , since it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not general MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map transl@@ ates general MIDI events into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of Change patch to B@@ right Piano into events of the Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et type and thus always lets you sound a trumpet when playing a piano .
if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM -@@ compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM equipment and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI maps , so you have to edit the corresponding file manually ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI Map is a text file that stores all necessary conver@@ sions for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , the assumption is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of the key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; A more key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an email so that I can offer support in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
this section describes how General MIDI &apos;s patches are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . the general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you must not change the order and do not om@@ it any line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to place all sounds that this instrument require to tune to the sound with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported for example ( GM patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with tone 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun shot . to do this , enter the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the note 60 , regardless of which sound is in the mi@@ di file .
please note that here the term drum @-@ patch of the patch is meant , in which each sound is another perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) .
the key@@ map section is used to specify how notes are m@@ apped on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
like in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries .
you can define several key maps for each channel and instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ words are mainly used to map notes on the percussion channel . take a look at the provided Key@@ words .
this section can be used to map some channels to another . for example , if you want to swap the first and second channel , just make it in the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards that have percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel that is m@@ apped onto the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map is used with the name name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which will attempt to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch is always used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful , for example , to always use the Per@@ c@@ ussions patch on the percussion channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der R@@ atio indicates in which ratio pitch ben@@ der events are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ benefit event with the value n , it is converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to prevent dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM thought that a keyboard , which receives a pitch @-@ benefit event with the value of 40@@ 96 , will play a note higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards try to play two tones up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI Map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . you will find it in the Settings menu , It@@ em MIDI Settings
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you can see which sounds are being played right now .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel there is a drop @-@ down list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the knob will no longer light green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has two different views ( up to now ) to view the played notes . in the Settings menu , select Settings under the section channel view : settings
the speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the bigger the speed .
so if you find a song too fast to follow the lyrics , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information on how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc . so the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
well , I can &apos;t force anybody , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support compiled . to remove the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example , k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I do not want to add all files separately .
agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
first , activate the Automati@@ cally add settings to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . to restore the default speed , you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have an &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or if I want to play a file , only switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; drag the window and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; pull .
if you only want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection , turn off the automatic addition to the collection , and the new one ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
let us assume you have the mi@@ di files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you only want to play the first file . so , set automatic adding to the collection and open it . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do it ?
these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me to program on &amp; k@@ mid ;
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; Mal@@ aga ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Mal@@ aga . I &apos;m currently studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Mal@@ aga .

if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ pink @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es
if you send me a postcard from your home or an MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group , I will list all of them with a postcard or a MIDI file . before sending a MIDI file , you should contact me because I might have the file .
I have &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and won &apos;t get money from anybody . I would like to emphasize that I only continue programming because / when I receive feedback from users ( post@@ cards or emails ) .

in addition , &amp; k@@ mid ; can also be found on its homepage , which is located at ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ pink / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , search for information and look at pictures . you can also find links to sites with other kar@@ aoke songs , etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , since sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM radio device or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound@@ card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you have a sound card unless you can of course hear no music .

it is possible to save the preferred links under the Book@@ mark menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent Play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups in order to receive an additional hierarchy level . if you select an entry , his group and all of his sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback will start with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current pieces &apos; , television and permanent play@@ lists can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do that if &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; not running . the various files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / K@@ M@@ Player / directory can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself .
after changing XML files , selecting Play@@ lists from the menu must be selected from the File menu , selecting either the Edit Mode , or selecting another category .
all changes are lost when processing mode is left or another group is selected without comparing with the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; some functions can only be turned on by modi@@ fying the XML configuration files .
the animation during starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and modi@@ fying &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during startup does not need to be short , it is automatically ended by opening another source . this would be disturbing for the end animation though , the user can therefore quit the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; In the source package of &amp; lt ; / lt ;
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the Con@@ figuration dialog by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for de@@ bu@@ gging is the &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; button in the tool@@ bar of K@@ M@@ Player . here is the output of mp@@ layer available .
there is no tab for this ren@@ dition in the Con@@ figuration dialog from &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manual editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c , like setting up the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how to play a &apos; flash &apos; with the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even add the special embed video to YouTube in the playlist XML .
in order for the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player to play &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player must be specified as a service provider for the Mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog file assignments of K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is used in a console application and search for error messages related to loading the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end output is inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
so that a given back@@ end is always taken for a certain mim@@ e type ( of course only if this was also determined ) , this must be done by manual modi@@ fying the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should play all o@@ gg files :
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before watching TV , you need to configure the device to be used and the TV channels . to do this , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be manually edited .
to configure V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player , the dialog appears in the Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; VD@@ R &gt; X@@ Video Port . there , ports should be detected , of which one is selected . the encoding must be found ( for example , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b in it .
since the V@@ DR support of K@@ M@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this way of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension needs to be functional for the X server . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
they use dv@@ d@@ nav@@ .dll , dv@@ d@@ source , source , source , pi@@ pes@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if enabled , start playing the playlist .
will there be hints how to qui@@ eter my CD@@ ROM drive when I play it ( not from V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is the user root after connecting the device . it is absolutely certain to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom is pointing to the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine only starts slowly , why does my CPU need to be checked for its performance ?
note : the answer is over@@ taken . k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically needs the last stored value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to be used for the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; Project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages from &amp; Ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; page .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users hardly have to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation should be taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is requested , the contact should be made via the Ki@@ le ; -@@ Website .
if you have questions about or comp@@ iling from &amp; Ki@@ le ; or if you want extensions , please contact the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; work area . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides the ability to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this easy , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and powerful project management are required .
to learn more about posters , and to learn about its possibilities , the manual to Kate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start directly with the reading of the chapter &apos;s work with the editor of posters ;
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right explanation : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , a La@@ y ( English lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; mac@@ ros can be used . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it deri@@ ves from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while here only a good overview of &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book on it . to be able to rule correctly , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
as well as other mark@@ up languages includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction with which the general properties such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text size are specified as well as a Cologne with text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ program class , the body begins with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again using the \ \ end { document } command .
the Quick Start As@@ sist from &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for the quick creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) offers some possibilities for creating the document . there may also be some settings related to the document .
document classes : this is used to select the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; PDF &#93; , report &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , Proj@@ ector &#91; Be@@ amer &#93; , fo@@ ils &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or custom .
coding : this is used to set the character encoding . modern systems are increasingly using UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best , UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ on packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; they only have to be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( for compliance with German DIN regulations ) .
new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . it is merely a brief description of the functions and further information on this topic are given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - as well as other source editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; if you want more areas of a green text on the screen , it is with great probability that some mathematical environment is not closed . however , it will save you by high@@ lighting time and pedestri@@ ans .
with automatic completion of the environments , entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) from &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically creates a blank line ( for input of the text ) and the corresponding line to shell the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set up in menu items ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually divided into several elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the document to be sub@@ divided into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ paragraph the bottom element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; the source search can be very helpful . once a DVI file is created , jumps &amp; Ki@@ le ; with a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer to the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text .
a DVI file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is in addition to PDF the usual output art of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for various systems and devices .
when using the tags search , the elements of the DVI file are inserted with the editor and as soon as an element in the DVI file was cli@@ cked , the corresponding section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text was pointed to . as soon as clicking on a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text was cli@@ cked , the corresponding point in the DVI ; viewer is jumped .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project settings .
quick : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
video surveillance : in this mode , the DVI file is called on a &apos; nearby &apos; , and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after quick construction .
when viewing the edit tool bar , the three large selection boxes should be conspic@@ uous . the selection boxes have been developed for quick integration of common elements into the document . the first selection box is for quick integration of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for sub@@ division are :
the Other is for example items such as keywords , notes , notes , or links . the available possibilities are :
name : with this command a name for a section , an image or other element is created .
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( choice over a selection box possible ) .
when using quotation , a selection list with literary entries is displayed . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file belongs to a project . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ eb@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written by hand .
the last drop @-@ down sel@@ ector with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã © e is used for the definition of the font size . it can be specified for the main text , the notes , etc . it contains the following font sizes :
when calling &amp; Ki@@ le , there are two choices available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written from the ground up with the hand .
the par@@ enth@@ eses after the command \ \ doc class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; speci@@ fies the font size . if the font size is not specified at the beginning , this can also happen in the text .
once the above source code example has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the simplest way to do this is to use the shell construction or the push of a button .
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically execute the storage .
if the compilation of the document fails , it should be sought in the logging after the errors . if you are using rapid construction , you should start automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be taken into account .
an environment ( engl@@ . environment ) is a text which is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size 12 will be created and only a few sets should have another font size . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } will then allow a change of the font size within the environment .
the changes are supervised only within the environment ( from \ \ begin to environment } up to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no limit ( number ) for changes in an environment .
there are many possibilities to capture the legi@@ bility and ease of use of the document . for example , it can be added to certain fonts , bold prints , cur@@ sive prints , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the ital@@ ics and is as long as it is closed until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a proposition can be represented ital@@ ically with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
after the background to write the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mark@@ up language was presented , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le follows .
as soon as a bit of text was entered in the wizard , a few adjustments should be made for the better read@@ ability of the document . to do so , a quotation , a few passages in the grease and cur@@ sive pressure and a poem should be applied to see the differences of these commands .
once the document is viewed , Editor View or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , its window has to be closed .
once the DVI file was created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . just try it and have fun .
DVI ; is a device @-@ independent file format . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screen .
for printing a &amp; DVI file , the same steps are necessary as for the document creation ( see ) . on the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed using file printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar enables the conversion of the DVI file into other formats . once the DVI file is created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , the conversion can begin in desired other formats using the buttons in the tool@@ bar .
the preliminary search permits the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; bin@@ aries . to do so , only Modern will need to set up settings in Ki@@ le ... Building tools to be selected .
in order to execute the pre @-@ selection search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source code and subsequently cli@@ cked on prior search . the jump to the corresponding place in DVI ; the viewer then takes place .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Document from &amp; Ki@@ le ; open and jump to the corresponding line . to do so &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; set up as text editor ( Set Settings ... Editor )
if there is no error when using the &amp; DVI file , an error can occur . if there is an error , this will be shown in the log file or the message window in summary .
the log file returns the source code in the source code . in the editor you can then use the Pre@@ vious La@@ Te@@ X bugs and other La@@ Te@@ X errors for sy@@ ring@@ es between the bugs . the log file always indicates the line in which the error appears . in order to view the faulty line , the error must be cli@@ cked in the logging and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jump to the defective line .
once cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document . the default options are :
when selecting a blank document , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the wizard is used to quickly create a new document . for more information , see the section .
hang users from &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or created a new file . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by means of an existing document and selecting file template from document ...
when creating a new document from a file New , some strings are replaced with other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings box ... settings can be set .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are sub@@ stituted by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by entering the document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ Documents class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { items } .
the simplest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document is created in this way , the following steps must be completed :
when creating a new document , you can then select your own template rather than the standard one .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; a simple way to create a template should be searched for a template found on the Internet and the steps described below .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; Plac@@ ards ; as an internal editor . &amp; Plac@@ ards ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and producing many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
to learn more about posters , and its opportunities , the manual to Kate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly by reading the chapter &apos;s work with the editor of posters ;
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be called via the La@@ Te@@ X reference menu . it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; and its syntax .
double @-@ click with pressed C@@ tr@@ l key to choose the &amp; tex ; this means that by clicking on \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ .
when dra@@ gging the text with pressed left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with a given shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse the most different types of source code and emphasize these . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands differ from the normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by a different color .
many assistants can add additional jumping marks . these are a special type of book@@ marks within the text . the menu items like to@@ ggle @-@ tok@@ ens or the respective buttons possible make the jump to the next or last jump mark . this is also highlighted by this jump mark , so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character .
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; Ki@@ le ; .@@ though &amp; Po@@ sters ; already outstanding possibilities , have been added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; &amp; lat@@ ex ; en@@ capsul@@ ates many environments and groups and therefore supports &amp; Ki@@ le ; special commands for their selection .
he@@ als a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing a blank line on both sides ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . the only cur@@ l thing in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is that the paragra@@ phs are separated by two empty lines .
select the word from the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , as this command also applies &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with a back button ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to delete a part of the document , of course this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; Po@@ sters ; provides the key C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the whole line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides with its own commands for a quicker convenience .
del@@ etes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is included in the description to Edit select paragraph .
it has already been made clear that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; for more commands in editing environment for a possible easy work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment .
if the cursor is in front of or inside the \ \ begin { environment } command , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted ambient orders , the overview can be lost quickly . this command closes the recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted ambient structure is not destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by brackets { ... } . the Edit Te@@ X group contains some important commands corresponding to those from the Edit environment .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the pad@@ lock .
if the cursor is located in front of or behind the pad@@ lock of a &amp; tex ; group # , it jumps to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted ground clips , the overview can be lost quickly . this command closes the last open group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups is not destroyed .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple reference marks are used as tools . for the appropriate implementation is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; used for two simple reference marks . also for the end of the application the character is used . &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and carries two conclu@@ ding marks for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic import of double quotation marks can be set up under Pre@@ ferences box ... La@@ Te@@ X will be switched on and off .
it can also be used in specific settings ( e.g. german or French ) and thus German or French reference marks . there are also many other languages available .
when pressing Shift , enter &amp; Ki@@ le ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is in a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not just a line break , but at the same time the command \ \ item .
close within a tables environment closes &amp; Ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ \ with an adjoining line break .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables environment and all E@@ t signs ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; Ki@@ le ; try to reach this . in case of Shift ; Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; Ki@@ le ; according to the next tab in the adjacent row . although this tab may not belong to the added tab , add some space for the columns position of the current tab .
although offering a good source code execution , it has been extended into &amp; Ki@@ le ; for special orders ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) are still extended . three of these work on demand and the other two are for automatic completion . all these modes can set up for different working methods under Settings ...
when starting a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } to an empty line ( for text ) .
when pressing the button , the last letter of the input is removed and it is possible to gr@@ ind the list . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are obviously removed when selecting a command . alternatively jumping marks can be added , so that a jump to these positions can be possible with the addition of the jump brand NEW jump mark and the desired parameters then can be frozen .
settings Ki@@ le ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; settings can be made to these lists . there can be different wish lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands as well as W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ters of the general language use .
the command mode is not necessary for the completion of environments . there must always be a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the call for full @-@ service mode will result in a large list of environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for enhancing the environment .
when invo@@ king the full @-@ time mode over the menu in full @-@ time environment or ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ke Alt + Shift @-@ key , the command to open the environment is automatically frozen and it appears \ \ begin . after that , the environment can be continued in the simplest way and terminated by pressing the input button .
after this is done , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; Ki@@ le ; recognizes that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is added .
settings Ki@@ le ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of completion mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; supports user @-@ defined lists of restrictions that can be immediately replaced by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings ... Ki@@ le can be set up . for example , the ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l file in which the L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X entry is included .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word is initiated by means of a complete abbrevi@@ ation or the C@@ tr@@ l + Alt space key , the letter L is replaced by the \ \ La@@ Te@@ X string .
large sau@@ cers are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it was found that many cries in a document are written more than once . thus offers &amp; Ki@@ le ; the completion for all already written cries .
this mode can be set up in the menu item Ki@@ le ... Ki@@ le can be completely switched off . here , the threshold value for displaying the completion can also be specified .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Graphics dialog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dialog shapes the contents of graphics as easy as possible . to view the basics of the graphics formats , the sections should be considered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PS files are not as popular as PDF files , but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages . if the PDF output is en@@ capsul@@ ated , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
in order to examine the result of the work , the source code must be compiled . all tools are comp@@ iling in the Men@@ Ã ¼ s Cre@@ ating , Cre@@ ating , and Gener@@ ating View .
for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used the key element Alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI file can be viewed in the standard viewer by Alt ; 3 , using Alt ; 4 the DVI file can be converted into a PS file and be viewed by Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the Quick Fast@@ ening command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no included viewer is used , a new window will open each time .
a new project is about the project New Project .... here@@ with the following information will be asked for the project :
when filling the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function from &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows exec@@ uting EC@@ MA@@ Script code . the scripts can be managed through scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet finished and can still be changed in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = Ki@@ le ) with the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite elaborate system where basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different help to support users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; will be shipped with a lot of documents , including a documentation for the contained packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
this is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important pack@@ ets are described ) but rather is a full user manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands contained and is thus ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents delivered with &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the finding of the right document is not always easy . as a possible help &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all to &amp; Ki@@ le ; documents delivered and for a graphical surface .
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or keywords . from &amp; Ki@@ le ; only the results are displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or pressing the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ier and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source code editor , which can be implemented on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; work surface environment . &amp; Ki@@ le ; is also part of the Fink project , thus &amp; Ki@@ le ; also available on &amp; Mac ; with OS @-@ X installed .
many thanks to those who want to continue the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project and sacrifice for many hours for the development of tools that we can use all under consideration of &amp; GNU ; current information on the contribut@@ ors is available in the Help menu &amp; Ki@@ le ; .

&amp; sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . with the command @-@ line interface you can create random signatures or day signatures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides signatures for external e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signatures , any signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read out . through many signatures with different quotes , styles and information , you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique .
for day signatures , the same signature is read from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig for the whole day . for each day , use it to use different signatures as with the random signatures you create unique emails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N file New . this gives you an empty ; empty signature ; in the Sig@@ natur@@ es section . click the &amp; lt ; empty signature ; and add your new signature in the lower section . save it with C@@ tr@@ l ; S file Save or click Save the disk icon .
you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for email programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; . whether you use emails privately or professionally , there are always enough signatures .
to delete a signature , select it first and then Rem@@ ove from the File menu or click on the icon with the red cross Rem@@ ove in the tool@@ bar .
to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click the User @-@ defined button on the right @-@ hand side and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the button or key combination .
to use &amp; k@@ not ; is &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 required . to attach signatures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program such as &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can paste the signature text from the output of a command .

the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their inclusion in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . all these tools use com@@ man@@ ders as surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as base . the combination yields fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Docum@@ entation has known about me and how outstanding it is . if we still lift it a piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no more need to rely on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked on the icon for the XML @-@ processor and done !
this application expects an inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is in the ge@@ aring working folder , leave the current working folder to be checked . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and enter the folder in the folder of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files will be deleted every time my pro@@ c is started .
as I said before , anyone who has worked on the &amp; quot ; documentation already knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical surface for it .
if the newly opened file is inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book , simply select the current working folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder , where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
if it comes to an output on the screen , your file is er@@ ron@@ eous . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be checked is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then the current file is simply ha@@ unted . if not , delete the current file and select the file to be checked by means of other file - file selection .
if you only want to know if the file well @-@ formed is , click the well @-@ formed check selection .
to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( default ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; using definition @-@ UR@@ I ; file selection .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file to be processed is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then simply select the current file . if not , remove the selected file and select the file to be processed by means of the other file selection .
enter the name of the file as the result should be named . the file is usually stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , have , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . thus , the plug @-@ in system becomes very powerful . they can immediately benefit from the additional functionality and do not have to wait until someone uses the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
to install a plug @-@ in or a k@@ part , we start editing plug @-@ ins . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows you to manage all included plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a storage location , you can use &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
often on a project several people work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the statement of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and is used for unique identification .
a member can have several roles in the project , such as team leader as well as sub@@ project leaders .
the user can select himself from the list of members of the team who he is . this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears fat after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of your own identity are important with regards to news and comments . see for further information on comments .
in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by recording the members of the team : it can be an event for information to the team leaders when something is happening . see for more information .
event actions are actions performed when something is happening in the project . an example would be recording the opening and closing of the project , so that later it can be seen how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that plays a file in CVS , as soon as it is added to the project etc ;
on the site event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings Di@@ alo@@ ges can create , edit and delete events .
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the receiver list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub @-@ project manager .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following :
ann@@ ot@@ ation is simple . it can either be selected the ann@@ ot@@ ation entry from the editor pop @-@ up menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment area followed by comment text .
notes can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the team member , role in the project from the following possibilities : team Manager Area Manager Sub@@ project leaders should be given the respective area or sub @-@ project names , as in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that are DT@@ D @-@ agnos@@ tic and support web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up by configur@@ ing Qu@@ anta . this dialog stretches over a number of pages that are treated in succession .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed with it . the entries are :
tags : large / small @-@ case of tags : large / small @-@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal upper / lower case , the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
upper@@ case / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : upper@@ case / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal upper / lower case , the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags automatically close : if checked , tags for which the closing tag is optional , will be inserted immediately after the tag .
do not include optional tags automatically : as above for all other tags except for simple tags .
update start and finish tag automatically : if enabled , the corresponding end tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic sub@@ stitution of acc@@ ent characters : controls automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the appropriate encoding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . using the default button , the def@@ aults can be restored .
default character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting will be ej@@ ected from the same in the project &apos;s properties if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D was not recognized . however , this setting will be ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; periodi@@ cally creates backup copies , so that during a power failure or crash the document can be recovered from this backup at the next start of the program . this is not the same as saving the file .
the preview and documentation can be previ@@ ew@@ ed either in the editing pane or in a separate view ( or documentation in a file path ) , making it possible to view the documentation , preview and the source text at the same time .
reset the default window settings at the next start is useful when the user interface is mess@@ ed up by modi@@ fying M@@ DI modes and do@@ cking / det@@ on@@ ating views . it is equivalent to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameter .
the warning message section is used to control the display of warnings by hooks of non @-@ en@@ quiries .
the place to change behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can define the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the sync behavior of the V@@ PL and the source code view in shared mode .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the illustration of the par@@ ser node in the document , can be set into details .
in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with mouse buttons .
in the area of structural tree settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the update frequency of the tree during editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree should be opened automatically . empty spaces are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element was found in the current document .
abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the if@@ W short@@ cut is something else than in a group valid for Javascript .
here , the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plu@@ gins are K@@ part @-@ applications from third @-@ side , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ part @-@ capable application , the most well @-@ known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located at a standard location like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
load Compon@@ ent in read @-@ only mode : check whether the plug @-@ in refuses to load . only @-@ read @-@ K@@ Parts normally refuse loading if this option is not selected .
check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , whether the information entered is correct . you can choose to save the entry , even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it will be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , de@@ bu@@ gging was completely re@@ developed . support for the no longer required built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger has been set , as well as support for the DB@@ G Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin concept was implemented that allows different implement@@ ations via plu@@ gins .
currently , only one plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plugin in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin sel@@ ector , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ user interface :
a view in which the content of monitored variable is displayed . normally appears in the left Do@@ ck .
a view in which all the post@@ marks , with line numbers and conditions are listed . normally appears in the bottom corner .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger appears . appears normally in the bottom Do@@ ck .
depending on the supported features of the de@@ bu@@ gger , all or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger if required , or it tells the plug @-@ in to listen to Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ cies . this action is fired by default when a project is opened that uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally you do not have to pay attention to it .
the counterpart to de@@ bu@@ gging session starts the session . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates listening to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server for a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger output .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and continuously send information about the monitored variable and the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution is continued . if a de@@ bu@@ gging request has started , the script starts with the request .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without having to send information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , execution continues . if there is a de@@ bug statement , execution starts as soon as a request is made .
the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script , where possible in functions and include will be corrected .
instruc@@ t the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the statement and go to the next level as if there wasn &apos;t the current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work of Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentary . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; ist ein &amp; k@@ de ; Front @-@ end and a K@@ D of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g , which they can find on ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g.@@ s@@ f.@@ net with many more works by Keith .
this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus to your needs and how you &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; can help to become better .
document type editing packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; they allow &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; their simplicity and flexibility makes out &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two ways , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages respectively &amp; CSS ; . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , which include &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and tag@@ XML files with extension .@@ tag@@ . tool@@ bars are handy , symbolic links of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , insert text and instructions more quickly into a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see for details about converting .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the property dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the tag shows . the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow a quick insertion of tags in a document without the risk of a write error .
tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag Fol@@ der carries the name of the description language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information about working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing but only element above itself .
the type of tag is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( family 2 )
only valid for class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 )
only valid for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 )
if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within that tag can be added to any other tag . ( only family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it defines the name and type of the attribute . additionally , there are other tags describing how to display this attribute , etc ; This is a single element type element .
speci@@ fies the source code used for filling in the tag editing dialog and the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name inside &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag that assem@@ bles the elements of a list together . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is a single element type element .
speci@@ fies the position of the attribute of a tag within a dialog . this tag allows for each attribute in a dialog only once ( e.g. once for each and lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
specify the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may appear within the tag to be defined . this element is a single element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a tag . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces influence nothing but watch &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; text &gt; will be replaced .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear , whose easy instructions are to follow .
this function is currently not available . currently , the check is performed only when the Tag@@ XML files are loaded in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in the following an example for a family 1 tag XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element of the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the file name for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a working family 2 tag XML file . in this file , one &amp; PHP is described ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
/ lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ Type = &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ Type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via DT@@ D editing DT@@ D settings . this can be edi@@ ed@@ es@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = App@@ ly 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D specification . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name will be used as a nick@@ name .
an action can be set by setting actions ... created . click New action will lead to the same dialog :
the keyboard short@@ cut assigned to this action . clicking on the user defined button can be assigned a short@@ cut ; with K@@ eine the current keyboard short@@ cut is removable .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) can be started . examples of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , themselves are the quick@@ start dialog or the various Read in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ script t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . This way , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus tries to find the script in the following locations : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in the command line :
% f : we will replace the current document URL . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name will be removed .
% p@@ id : will be replaced with the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance is running , the text will be unique to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above listed methods , a script input can be received from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . in the input field , input can be specified , which is to be sent to the standard input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually meaningful only with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be rer@@ ou@@ ted . there are two types output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages are directed to the standard output . it can be specified , which should be done with the text written on the standard output by setting the value to the output selection field :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create your own tool@@ bar for each group . in the given case it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the mark@@ up .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . choose settings to set actions .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode .
complete all necessary fields and add the tag to the right tool@@ bar .
complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you plan its use , activate the &quot; Edit Day &quot; dialog when available so that an input is possible when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let us replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ ic ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , graphics More programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ ic ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size .
please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the day start , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green becomes mostly as loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least , send a message to the user that clicking this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start ; tag in the current document .
after creating the symbol it has to be connected to the action . this is done via the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and select the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , if there are any , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the tool@@ bar or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview by some separ@@ ators . open the tool bar dialog via Settings tool bars . make sure the desired tool@@ bar is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( top left ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I would like a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by absor@@ bing all symbols to ensure that everything works .
save in the right folder . after new e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please fit your file descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that your tool bar ( s ) will be loaded ( s ) when a file is opened by the corresponding type .
perhaps the most notable addition of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you might check in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; repository if someone has already done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to look for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file .
# K@@ DE config file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for this documentation e.g. &amp; PHP ; func@@ 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html ... &#91; Con@@ text &#93; Con@@ text@@ List = sec@@ . html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 2@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 2
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see the &amp; PHP documentation for example :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that there are sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the box depth ( except for reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
you realize that the table of contents is directly refer@@ enced to a file ( and consequently displayed at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder displayed ! ) .
spaces affect nothing , but watch &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Resources files are replaced .
the content section is the domain of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is used for creating context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function is to be displayed . by marking the function name and pressing C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context help , the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of semi @-@ detached context elements that are to be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your do@@ cr@@ c file to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you specified in your do@@ cr@@ c file ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that these are good and worth being shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation has been used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the discern@@ ing resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent via e @-@ mail to friends , partners or anyone else . in various places there is an email menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D pack@@ et ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , send tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the scripts tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all the other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus users can download them . the contributions will be checked and only made available if our team uses them as correct and useless for publication . to make an airport commentary , we recommend that the origin of the resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for the later users .
when up@@ loading you are asked for their Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private g@@ pg key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can select one . in the New Resource dialog you need to fill in the input fields ( URL Pre@@ view can remain empty ) and start the upload with clicking OK .
the upload can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D Package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menus , upload tool bars tool@@ bar , and start in the context menu of files and folders in the Tem@@ plate and Scrip@@ ting tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , examines &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . in case of problems it warns and it can then be abor@@ ted . please note the warning messages carefully . if the integrity is given and the resource is signed properly , a message appears with the statement of the author of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . however , creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be required in tag@@ XML format . there is the easier way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D loading and converting a DT@@ D . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description to be used . after that , the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! doc@@ type Defini@@ tions : the string that should appear in ! doc@@ type Tag , like HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d
fine adjustment of D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after conversion to &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . in order to understand these concepts and to take full advantage of them , one must first acquain@@ t themselves with these fundamental concepts .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
global elements are available for everyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . from tool@@ bars to actions everything that is marked globally is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of administrators to secure various tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that only this user can use them personally .
project @-@ related elements are available only within a particular project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , making the common use of special tools and patterns em@@ itted by all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the editor window , the tree views , the flash@@ cards with information and the tool@@ bars .
you can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as closing , delete or upload the document , jump to a bookmark or run CVS commands to the current document .
right @-@ click in the editing pane will lead to a further context menu regarding the processed document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , edit the tags under the mouse poin@@ ter , or open the file , when the string is called a file under the mouse poin@@ ter .
at the top end of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as a standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of the further extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and the connected user needs .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; in your document , click on the icon representing the tag . now you can enter the data for this exactly inserted day . if you want to insert a tag that has several attributes ( like anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog with different fields .
the tree views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus information ; to navigate , open and ro@@ am them . in the presentation with file lad@@ ders there are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view displays all the files in the project and allows managing files in the project by right @-@ clicking . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading , or del@@ eting files from the storage media can be done with the context menu displayed .
a further possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website etc .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on what context they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; work area . global templates are always available , local templates only usable for the respective user and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project works also here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the information available to a script .
with this view one shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking on an element opens a list of commands regarding navigation and refresh of the tree .
this tree appears among the other tree views . it can change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces with it . the application system oriented to the content enables the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packaged documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be app@@ ended , edited and viewed for project @-@ specific documentation .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , two boxes at the bottom of the window , can be accessed using the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all the changes to the DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts running out give all error messages ( as there are any ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensively expanded and easy to understand . show them on a icon and they will display the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bars is the option to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar by e @-@ mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; send the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a tool@@ bar in an email , you can save it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; like any other backup and load !
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for that , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are simple to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems when starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H in front of your bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE interface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; designed for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an underlying idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ? well , this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer restricted to pure &amp; HTML ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summ@@ arized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
now , to the above claim must be stated that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; quot ; Develop@@ er community . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of why develop what has already developed someone else ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; App@@ ly , it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ coated actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is possible almost every task .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly expanded to a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
for more details , see help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or help help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes each time you open a file that is not on it , with the oldest record being taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . look in the section about templates . if they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
when inser@@ ting the special characters contained in the clip@@ board , converts to &amp; HTML code contained there , so that they are displayed correctly and are not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions .
converts the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; sp@@ elling which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s first and foremost to paste &amp; URL ; s into the anchor tag .
to@@ g@@ gles the block selection . this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift ; button .
enter directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script releases error messages !
looks for a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a sort of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
removal and turning of the problem @-@ porter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated as soon as one changes to the structural tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with one mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with the entries previous or next , depending on the cursor position in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that might be there . this allows for example , to copy video files to your project folder or sub@@ folder , and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project is managed . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you will find the details .
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : locally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be set by settings actions ... added . tool@@ bars are saved by tool@@ bars tool@@ bars or you will be asked when you want to save the tool@@ bars .
removes a tool bar from the field of view . it does not delete it from your hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do so .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ) team , so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x .
allows you to upload tool bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in .
load a &amp; DT@@ D ; that you or anyone else has done and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities of the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P need to be refresh@@ ed without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and there is no write permission in the global K@@ DE folder , the load fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the default ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menus .
currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , if this tag contradic@@ ts the rules in this place .
in the plu@@ gins menu , the available plu@@ gins are listed under the above menu items . click on them . click on activated plug @-@ ins disabled .
sel@@ ects the syntax highlight mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the posters ; version .
sel@@ ects the type of line end identi@@ fier . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms for developing . select Unix , Windows / DOS , or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate switching between the different types of user interface . due to some restrictions in the K@@ DE libraries , the switching can sometimes take time or cause un@@ nice graphics . the flash@@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub @-@ window . selecting an entry will enable the corresponding sub@@ window .
to@@ g@@ gles the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window on or off .
the changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
al@@ ig@@ ns the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of posters ; you will find details .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the tool@@ bars or add them and modify the sequences .
this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse @-@ cursor but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project , the developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled out from above down@@ wards as , for example , after filling out the project name , the whole directory structure will be completed automatically for the rest of the project . all of these paths and author information fields can be set later using Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties .
here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is automatically filled in .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ dbf ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder in which the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to include files from the local file system to the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . with server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
checked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included . if a project is started from scratch , not hook .
this option displays all files and folders within the main folder , and you can select an exact selection according to your discretion .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hook or , by removing the tick , clips from the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the Project Properties menu in the menu tree in the Pro@@ files sub@@ window or Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in detail . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders possible ) will be ignored for project @-@ related operations , such as project folders .
additional option to top , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can read more about project views .
this allows the desired de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set using the Options button .
in the Pro@@ files sub@@ window , high loading profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile , showing a separate tree view for each profile .
in the team configuration window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration , event actions can be turned on and add , modify or delete these actions . event actions are executed when a previously determined event occurs , such as the backup of a file . see the details .
by default , open &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the last one opened . this behavior cannot be influenced at present .
to open another project , select project open ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project supervision gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folder behave as well , but the entries are missing and open with ... in the right @-@ click context menu :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows removal of the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button will be blin@@ ded to prevent removing .
the password is kept in the kernel memory and forgotten by BAE programs . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather in@@ secure password on the disk - option does not come into question .
this will stop the transmission or just leave the dialog when you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high loading profiles can be created and the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers .
this is the name of the server to which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally this does not need to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving feature or a risk . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it cannot be easily read , but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. by simply changing the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be saved , opened or deleted in the Project or Project tool@@ bar , accessible via Settings tool tool@@ bar Project tool@@ bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps to increase productivity , but also allows for the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
as mentioned above , tool@@ bars are designed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , best stack@@ able using the tool@@ bar menu . use and addition differ . adding tool@@ bars is discussed below in the Add section of tool@@ bars .
the tool@@ bars and icons can be set using either context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which a new tool@@ bar can be created , other actions like tool@@ bars can be removed , tool@@ bar ren@@ ame or tool@@ bars can be executed , which can be specified where actions on this or other tool@@ bars can be visible .
by invo@@ king the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , the action will be removed and action displayed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings tool bars ... and set settings to set .
templates are basically document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ ps and files for connecting . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used Tem@@ plates basically like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or merge each directory existing on the system into the template tree .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supplied templates have conditions for their use . please read the terms and conditions specified at the beginning of each template before using exactly .
binary templates are usually included in documents using short@@ cuts ( e.g. pictures with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . more information on the template tree is available .
documents can be from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally , more specific documents are created in appropriate sub@@ folders . you make a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in an appropriate way to be efficient . see for more information on the template tree .
this type of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template , but the same text area . you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl . see for more information on the template tree .
as the name says , these templates are used for entire websites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summ@@ arized in a compressed tar archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and select File As template save as a local template ....
once this has been done , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . see the template tree below project templates .
select text in your document and click File Save as template as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can simply be dra@@ gged with dra@@ gging and dropping to the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . it can be used for all file management functions , such as dra@@ gging and dropping or past@@ ing over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can click on a folder to the right in the file tree or in the project files , and create a site template , enter and secure a name for the template . by default , it is backed up in the project folder , but of course it can also be stored as a local or global template .
project templates enable a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can set header lines and foot@@ ers or dynamic with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them . additionally , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects .
template structure in sub@@ window templates is based on the $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates stored files . each folder corresponds to one of four types of containers , as explained above .
to set the behavior of a folder , select the folder view with the right mouse button on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a sel@@ ector with the three types previously described ; files , text or templates . this selection is da@@ zz@@ led as soon as el@@ ter@@ istic attributes have been inherited .
this is enabled by default and fits all except the root folders in the template folder . if a root folder is set like this , it would disable templates in this path , except they would appear explicitly . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you will probably find yourself in a root folder .
this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project , allowing copying of content templates to a folder with he@@ aders / foot@@ ers to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you can use context menu ( to show right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders , copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source @-@ Editor , which can be accessed via the View menu . the first mode sub@@ stitutes the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second sub@@ divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cursor appears . then you can edit and turn back to the source editor when necessary , in which the changes in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor on a document that contains &amp; PHP , a small green symbol indicates the V@@ PL . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; to edit &amp; PHP ; there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that the changes are visible both in the source editor as well as in the V@@ PL ; the cursor is activated in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; this mode is activated by pressing F@@ 9 . pressing F@@ 9 activ@@ ates the active cursor from one window to the other , while maintaining the position in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source code editor is configur@@ able via settings Qu@@ anta . after choosing V@@ PL ; -@@ View you can select between synchronization after one click or automatically . in the selection automatically , the period of time can be set .
assuming you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to select document properties . this allows the editing of invisible tags when working with the V@@ PL ; the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is created . this can be changed :
met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . clicking on the list allows you to change the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of creating the appearance of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list . a change to the list is just as possible with the Met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style file by pressing the file open button and selecting the corresponding file .
the use of the cursor is possible as in a word processor , by moving the arrows . under rare circumstances the cursor is peculiar . the marking works as usual .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way via the tool@@ bar , as in the source code editor . it is to be noted that inser@@ ting tags before already existing identical tags is not removed , e.g. when an anchor tag , enclosed with text , must be removed from any other anch@@ oring tag .
some tool@@ bars like the table assistant or the Listen @-@ Assistent are disabled . they will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; they will need to be used in this release the tables or lists of tool@@ bars .
in contrast to other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style sheet design can be followed .
around &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile , you need except &amp; k@@ de ; still the lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML libraries that are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de .
new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , orph@@ aned stops can be set in a specified file and line number and later enabled .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g returns the full path from a file name without path input . file names in the same folder as the top @-@ loaded style file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g Is , for example , a style file file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l is loaded , the following input is possible :
this command will review a partial or entire agreement with a template named QNA@@ ME or a given mode name . &amp; eg ; template matches any QNAP product that contains the template template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; is extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 becomes &amp; eg ; extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a sought after stopping point must be resolved for the associated UR@@ I and line number . this is done automatically when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . stopping points are re @-@ checked shortly after starting each iter@@ ation .

on systems with the installed re@@ ad@@ line library , you can scroll down to / off using the path ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes of the previously executed commands .
several commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to pass compiled expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; as an argument , a stopping point is set in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; . &quot;
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template which consists only of the ASCII characters 0x@@ 00 up to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a fully qualified name like &quot; x@@ s@@ l : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;
fil@@ en@@ ame : a valid local fil@@ en@@ ame on the user &apos;s system . on Unix or Cy@@ g@@ win systems , the name may have the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as a short form for the personal folder . other environment variables are allowed on R@@ IS@@ C @-@ OS systems .
P@@ AT@@ H : a path to change the work@@ folder . on some operating systems the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; is replaced by the path to your personal folder .

there are many graphical tools to compare . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts while merging .
the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see exactly what had changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and insert it in one of the comparative windows .
a function that made a lot of work was comparing and merging folders . this function changed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
3 @-@ way merge is fully supported . this is useful if two persons work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes . the merge editor among the differences windows enables resol@@ ving conflicts and simultaneously displays the result to be expected . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when merging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps with comparing and merging complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and follows the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often need to check codes , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tab@@ s are displayed visible . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left . ( no more trouble if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is equal and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means both files differ .
if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can make the typing work easier by writing the file name of the first file completely . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 Fol@@ der 2 folder 2 -@@ o destination folder , diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 Fol@@ der 2 folder 3 -@@ o destination folder
the opening dialog allows for manually entering fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting from the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the opening dialog mem@@ ori@@ zes your selection and displays them next time . you do not have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences is carried out with two files .
via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the comparison or merging of folders will be initiated . if a file is selected , for B and C , however a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the other two folders .
when combined , the input field is active for the target and can be edited . however , it is not necessarily necessary to immediately specify an output file . you can also do this step later when saving .
the Con@@ figuration button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before starting with the merge / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board to the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in open dialog you do not need to select any files , you can just close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button .
you can also drag and drop a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
what is the idea behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you would need to create two corresponding files , upload them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , and then compare them . now you can simply copy , paste and compare the relevant sections .
note : at present , you can &apos;t remove anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the dropping of text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the dra@@ gging and dropping text into another program than cutting and past@@ ing ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the Info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Every info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , allow the mouse to rest a while above the line . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned to the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , you can see the color which differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files . this is good to see in the next section ( merging ) .
if differences are found , the color indicates the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare single cases . )
the vertical line dividing the summary column from the text is interrupted at the points where the respective source file has no lines . if the line break is enabled , the line is represented on broken lines .
the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the wor@@ ding output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changes &#93; if you edited the result . usually , it contains text by automatic merging , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the S@@ prin@@ ge buttons to the next solved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , each difference is also a conflict that needs to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the row is selected in all windows and the first line of the group will be shown . ( this will also highlight a jump in the position in the windows , where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for the current area and each on the left appears a black bar .
sometimes through automatic merging or manual editing , no more line is left in the group ; then in these lines the text &amp; lt ; No line in the Qu@@ el@@ puts ; displayed . this is just a plac@@ eholder in case you change your mind and perhaps again select another source . this text appears neither in the final saved file , nor in a marker that you might copy and past@@ ed somewhere else .
the Text &amp; lt ; Conf@@ lic@@ t Conf@@ lic@@ t ; however , appears in the clip@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : when selecting the sources ignor@@ ing the numbers or Ign@@ oring C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white notes .
if you click in any of the windows , you can use the arrow keys to the left , right , high , down , side down , side down , start , end , C@@ tr@@ l start and C@@ tr@@ l end , Si@@ w as you are used by other programs .
in the exit window , you can also use the other keys to edit . using the In@@ sert key , you can switch between insert mode and over@@ write mode . ( default is insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summ@@ aries synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the Con@@ duc@@ ting section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons to navigate to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ down / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ up ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Picture Up / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Picture ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict .
to copy the selection to the clip@@ board , you need to automatically copy the Copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l In@@ sert ) . if this option is checked , it will automatically copy whatever you mark and manually copy the manual . be careful with this option because you could accidentally over@@ write the clip@@ board contents .
line ends are saved according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 based systems use cart @-@ return character \ \ r \ . K@@ diffusion 3 does not keep the line end of the source files , therefore you should not use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of the last used files will be saved automatically when you exit and restored at the next start . ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ IP set up ... )
select a font with a fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , but you shouldn &apos;t use them . )
if you enable this option , differences are displayed in ital@@ ics . if the selected font is not supported , nothing happens at all .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered scann@@ ed . on these systems pres@@ ets automatically adjust an un@@ controlled color .
if this option is enabled , the corresponding number of whit@@ esp@@ ace characters is inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab character is inserted .
if you press input or return , the return of the preceding line will be automatically used for the next line .
when this option is enabled , each selection is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . the manual copy to the clip@@ board then drops .
you can select which line type you prefer to save . the default value is the generally usual selection on the used operating system .
when comparing files , try &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step white characters are not ignored . even when merging white characters are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a cart @-@ return character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , others only save a new@@ line character &apos; \ &apos; . but then files with different sizes in the page @-@ to @-@ side comparison look identical , but then files with different sizes in the page @-@ to @-@ side comparison look identical , but then , if this option is checked , this option will be disabled .
in the first part of the analysis , numbers and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are still shown , but they are treated like white notes .
in default , this option is down@@ lighted . changes in comments are treated like changes in white notes .
search for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slow for very large files .
in automatic jump mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before jumping on to the next un@@ resolved conflict .
automatically resol@@ ves all conflicts in white notes by using the selected file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important . if you only need this from time to time , then you better use the Select A / B / C functions for any un@@ resolved white conflict from the merge menu . note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or Ign@@ or@@ ere C / C + + comments are enabled .
these options are treated in the chapter on the scanning of folders and conducting a merge . see for details under documentation on how to compare and merge .
if a file is saved and already an older version exists , the original version will be app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
adapt the language of the interface . changing this option does not apply to the currently running program . you must end &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language will be set globally over the control center . )
the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you enable this option , the upper end is used for all entries .
above the selection fields for encoding a short reference appears , which is local coding . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . as the coding for each file is individually set , even files with different coding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which coding is to be used for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not be able to work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands .
turn this off to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting changes in white notes in text or overview columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or Ign@@ or@@ ere C / C + + comments are enabled . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are shown in a color co@@ ded over@@ see column . but sometimes you may want to see the differences between two of three files .
sometimes you &apos;d prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply stop the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you look at the differences and then decide to merge the files . merging the current file in the merge menu also works if you only compare two files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as default names for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it will first commit this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command becomes visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor that meets your requirements . you can use this function for example to cut out disturbing parts or correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it will first commit this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this pre @-@ processing command . the output of the command is only used in line distance . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l completely sufficient .
use this pre @-@ processing command for new@@ lines to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is an erg@@ o expression that matches all characters in one line . the \ \ 1 in the replacement string refers to the found text in the first pair of clip . the \ \ U converts the found text into capital letters .
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically insert generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword sub@@ stitution ) . all following the same pattern $ keyword ear@@ ns $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you &apos;re experim@@ enting with sed , you might start to understand it and maybe you might like those regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ diffusion 3 . but it is good as an example of a further processing command for line identi@@ es. sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each match is sub@@ stituted by nothing , so virtually deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several re@@ plac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the composition . example :
instead you can also use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replacement / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos;@@ How@@ ever , per@@ l needs some details . where used \ \ ( and \ \ ) , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data according to the normal pre@@ processor will be retained for displaying and merging . further operations change only the data that the line @-@ like al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m sees .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ like pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hide differences , you may in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently not notice certain differences and in the worst case will destroy important data .
often programmers need to edit many files in one folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively and merge .
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adapt the proposal before starting ,
... can simul@@ ate the merging and show the simulated changes without really performing them ,
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and merging individual files . you just need to open folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder is specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically , do not merge . to start the merge , you must select the respective menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . )
while scanning the folders , a small message window informs about the current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folders , only the files that were then compared are listed .
when scanning the folder finishes , displays &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and folder that was found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is normally folded together . you can open a folder by double @-@ clicking on the + / - or by double @-@ clicking on the object or by using the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu includes two functions All sub@@ directories and open all sub@@ directories with which you can open or fold all the folders .
if you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison will be started and a comparison window appears .
the icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be automatically selected . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this kind .
as shown in the picture above , the colors of red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns .
for identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then folders also have the same color . for folders , age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is green , then yellow and later , when it is old , becomes red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copying A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faulty objects exist , merging can &apos;t be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faulty objects exist , merging can &apos;t be started .
the mode for syn@@ cing is active , if only two folders and no explicit destination folder were specified and if the option directories are active . then Sel@@ ects &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ame for the output file only B ; copied directly after merge &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B according to A. )
if two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merging ( unsure ) , then examines &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file for copying . if the files are different but the same date , then an error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical .
during merging , a file is processed after the other . you indicate the status column when the merge was successful , and corresponding messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is okay all over .
if the file comparison method is selected full @-@ time analysis in the setup dialog , K@@ RS@@ 3 will display additional columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , deleted , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge .
please note : if you have not specified a destination folder , then in the three @-@ folder merged mode C is used as the destination , B is chosen as the destination in the two @-@ folder merged mode , and the A and / or B will be used as the destination when synchron@@ izing .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check that all entries should be in the destination folder , also displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that might be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory merge start / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to bring only the current item , select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if invalid merge actions still exist due to conflic@@ ting file types , a message appears indicating the defective items . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog appears with the options Exec@@ ute , Simulation and Canc@@ el .
if you first want to see what would happen without really making any changes , you will receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merging a single file ) , a merge window will pop up ( note the screen@@ shot ) .
once you have finished with a file , select another directory merge to start / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog appears . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work with the next entry will continue .
if you click on a fault , a message and detailed status information will appear . at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem . if you want to restart the merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , you can choose another action for the entry or solve the problem otherwise before proceeding with the merge .
if some entries have been merged individually , you notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and do not merge them once again . even if the merge action has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries are considered completed . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . multiple patterns can be entered . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( eg@@ . * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignor@@ es files that would also be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this can be specified with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look under info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a hiding attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a previous dot sel@@ ects a file than hidden . this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
for links to files : if the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is down@@ lighted in default .
if the option is turned off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the links are treated like normal folders and searched for recur@@ sively . ( note that if the option contains a link in itself would lead to an endless loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes down . ) This option is disabled in default .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns . ( the number of deleted , un@@ solved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders through a slow network , it may be faster to compare just the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you some security . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
similar to the same as the date of change . no real comparison takes place . the files are considered identical if they are equal size . this can , for example , be useful when copying the change date . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
activ@@ ates Synchron@@ ize mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions to merge are selected so that the two folders are identical . also , the results of merging files are stored in both folders . this option is disabled in default .
if there are differences , instead of merging , copying the newer file is suggested as an action . ( this is considered uns@@ afe because the knowledge is assumed that the other file has not been modified . ) This option is disabled in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version is renamed and receives the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , it will be deleted without further backup . this also concerns the normal merging of individual files , not only the merging of whole folders .
normally , the folder merge view will remain visible while merging individual files ; you can shift the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want this , you can switch the directory &amp; text window to the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between directory &amp; text window .
you can also directly merge a single file directly without first having to run the folder merged . to do so , use the current file merge from the merge menu . as soon as you save the result , the status will be restored and the file will not be merged once you start the folder merged .
but this status is lost when you re @-@ read the directory : directory menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . this way you can specify files and folders that are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . you should note a few things :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. contain . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be escaped . ( # - &gt; % 23 , Space &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished from a link to a file or folder . then a file is always assumed as a link destination . ( ft@@ p : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way of editing per@@ missions or modification date . therefore , the per@@ missions or the change date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose is at present as a difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P . K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P always starts the built @-@ in differences observer . to start K@@ Def@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select in K@@ SZ@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
normally needs &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . but if it is applied as a K@@ Part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; assuming that the input file is a patch file in unified format . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Pre@@ view in - K@@ diffusion 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exist . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since creating the patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; executed as part , it only supports comparing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diffusion 2 ( now hot comp@@ are ) exist already . furthermore , the name K@@ RA already points out that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a long time and have learned a lot by browsing through the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way or are going to go that way .
you compiled the program from the sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default configure is installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE will not find the resources for the user interfaces ( eg k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file , you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical first ; however , if only one non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not identical . i@@ F similar lines for next to each other , this are is more often the case .
the editor notices for each difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this is necessary to easily solve a conflict by clicking in the source code and selecting the A / B / C button . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information .
the effort is so far too large . you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . in order to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly found ; No sr@@ c left ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already uses many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be confusing and missing the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all features of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ R@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of the last changes can be found at ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source package .
to compile and install in a system with &amp; k@@ de ; use the following command in the basic folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir returns the folder in your system in which K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you shouldn &apos;t have problems with comp@@ iling . if difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists of them .
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) into the clip@@ board and delete the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift @-@ In@@ sert ) insert the text from the clip@@ board at the current cursor position or replace the current selection .
show only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , after changes to these options , you must re @-@ read the folder with the refresh function . )
there are only entries that show differences . this also means that identical files are not copied to the destination folder when merging . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after merging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default .
note the buttons for selecting the source with the let@@ tering A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the rows will be app@@ ended to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the rows are already present , they will be removed when clicking on the button .
in default , this option is down@@ lighted . differences in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini show of all virtual desktop space . it is quite practical to see the running programs on the work@@ tops , change their size , quit them or move them . this works in both a desktop and several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops and the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved to the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows inside &amp; p@@ p@@ ager can be moved . the movement is possible in both a desktop and other working areas .
the context menu will depend on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu only has to set up the two entries p@@ ager ... and exit . if however click on an application inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries will minimize , maximize , Desktop and exit . the commands do the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows inside the p@@ ager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other working areas .
when this field is ti@@ cked , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of the virtual desktop will be displayed .
tick this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; show the numbers of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is tra@@ cked together with name , the names are provided with ord@@ inal numbers , &amp; eg ; 1 . working area .
if this field is ti@@ cked , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in the p@@ ager .
if this field is ti@@ cked , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty areas will be displayed to enable their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rect@@ angle with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its default symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the ordering of the p@@ ager can be specified : classic &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; appear in a 2x@@ N grid , as seen from p@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizontal shows all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in horizontal and vertical bar in a vertical row , which is very good for displaying side@@ ways on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini @-@ program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display and move windows as symbols or with their content .

this application is interesting for different users : artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; K@@ mag .
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly updated for new features . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance machines .
when you start &amp; K@@ mag , a window appears as pic@@ tured above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag , displays the enlarged area of the screen . the image shown in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is described below as a selection window .
in default , magni@@ fied &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter is like a mobile magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can view &amp; K@@ mag ; this causes a select screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( drop@@ down mode ) or the environment of the mouse @-@ cursor at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left side of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter . please note that &amp; K@@ mag ; currently not able to see the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default click ; / Q@@ t ; cursor .
in the drop @-@ down mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button down , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
in addition , if you press the &amp; Shift , press key or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can post@@ p@@ one the selection window .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the drop @-@ down window is fixed and only the bottom right corner is to move .
&amp; K@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy it to the clip@@ board ( to paste it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more .
starts or stops the update of the display . stopping the update brings the required CPU time to zero .
select the update rate ( Very low , Low , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window will be displayed . the selected area will be displayed in a window .
&amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your default short commands to save files , opening a new window , printing , rel@@ o@@ ading ( with the button document rel@@ o@@ ad in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , enlarge and los@@ ers &amp; etc ; .
k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen lou@@ pe . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; you can use an area of the screen so as you &apos;d use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visual han@@ dicapped .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter persi@@ sts in the same place for a while . it is intended to help people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury Syndrome ) and any mouse click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse ho@@ ver holds a while in the same place . it is intended to help people who suffer from the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which each mouse click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , pain associated with the use of your computer may also be caused by the use of your mouse if this is not yet done .
to clarify it again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and exec@@ utes a mouse click once you briefly inter@@ rupt the movement .
if the smart move is activated , it makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after it emul@@ ates the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement before releasing the mouse button . this way you can drag the drag with pressed mouse button . the smart move requires a little exercise , but you get used to it quickly .
this residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click performs .
if Intelligent Sub@@ mit is enabled , the shooting time is activated ( 1 / 10 s ) . here , the time is set , the &amp; m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , waiting for the mouse button down before releasing the mouse button again , if there is no moving mouse button in the meantime .
is this function enabled , creates a slow moving to the right and back followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . these movements are saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time it is started , but they can be changed later .
if the sound appears delayed , you can click &amp; k@@ de ; to shor@@ ten the response time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the tab General . there &apos;s a slider Sound Buff@@ ers , which you can set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
if this setting is selected , it will start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available . at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program there .
reset all settings to the values that were set when opening the dialog . if you already pressed the App@@ ly button , the settings will be reset to the last user press .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the pres@@ ets . in particular , the smart move should be turned off at first . if you have become accustomed to the automatic mouse click , you can later add the smart move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it might be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in sounds .
first you should make yourself aware of which places a mouse click without effect remains : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that does not display a link does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use it again .
when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the trick is that you don &apos;t just clean the mouse ball , but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you need to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be quickly clear when you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the roller . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . you can scra@@ pe the dirt and the dirt easily with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use the smart move in this case , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation cannot stop by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use a different window manager and move a window .
the solution to this problem is that you can execute a mouse click . this will reset the status of the c@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; c@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cursor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want it . however , use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the head@@ lines of windows .
I try to work with intelligent pushing , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text .
the smart move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time before you can handle it . it is very likely possible to mark text , copy it to the clip@@ board , or execute any other action you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . but it will probably cause you problems . here are some ad@@ vices :
do not use the intelligent move if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use it as follows : at the one end of the text area , press a mouse click and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . this is done every time &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button pressed down a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the move time starts with smart move . later , you can use the intelligent move even without the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ test extension for the X Window needs to be installed , which should be the case for most of the system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and these are correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pressing the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter disappears . this program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and causing pain to be activated .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured in such a way that a drag process starts before the mouse button is released . in this way , dra@@ gging and dra@@ gging with the mouse can also be performed .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that allows dum@@ b users to let their computer speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; dum@@ b users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose sentences from a list with the conversation history , which shall once again be spoken .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen@@ shot ) enter the command that will be used later for the voice output of text . for more details , see the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the default text message book . from the text passages , you can often choose used text passages without typing them . of course , the text passages can be edited .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) you determine the dictionary of words . &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language in order to determine the frequency of each word . in addition , you can compare the word@@ lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org Dic@@ tionary so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be incorporated into words .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly arranged and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your pro@@ positions ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and an exp@@ ir@@ ation memory of the already spoken phrases ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
if you have mouth @-@ right , you can enter the phrases you want to hear in the input field . each spoken set is app@@ ended to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . you can select phrases that are to be spoken once again .
with the Settings tab , set up ... open the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the word translation and the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page .
in the input field of the voice card speech output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the drop @-@ down box below the input field , specify the character encoding , with the text transmitted to the voice generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text on . select the check box if the text should be passed on as standard input to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be given as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders here :
of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation on your language generator .
the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ dem@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standardized interface for voice output is available and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . choosing this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection box action based on the selection of a text passage you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the Text passages menu or in the bar for text passages .
with the choice of immediate words the selected text passage will be directly spoken and inserted in addition to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . with the selection of in the input field , the selected text passage will first be entered into the input field .
with the second drop @-@ down sel@@ ector of the editing window for text log@@ book , you can specify whether the text message book should be saved automatically when closing the editing window .
when saving changes , the text message book is not saved . if you choose to save changes , select &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text message book should be stored .
the word translation page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for word translations . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a drop @-@ down box if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this drop @-@ down box , you can select the currently used dictionary for word completion .
using the buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field and in the drop @-@ down box .
select the desired language for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of each word is simply matched by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org Dic@@ tionary to include only correctly written words in the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged and how they should be wei@@ ghted .
with this option you create a new , empty dictionary with no entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically add to the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary in the course of time .
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided in two . in the upper part , the text@@ books are represented as tree structure .
in the lower part , you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the respective short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage , you can only change its name .
you can either add actions like new text passages or books or delete selected text passages and books either by selecting the menu bar , tool@@ bar or drop @-@ down menu .
the order of text passages or text passages can be changed by dra@@ gging the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory .
the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected sentences of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory .
if this menu entry is ti@@ cked , a sliding tool bar is displayed using buttons for frequently used commands . the tool@@ bar is located by default above the editing window directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is ti@@ cked , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with indications about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is ti@@ cked , a sliding bar for text pass@@ books is displayed with entries . the tool@@ bar is placed by default above the editing window directly below the tool bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
probably you have not entered the command for voice output correctly or not completely . open the settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the General Settings page and enter the command for voice output on the voice card voice output . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . )
the festival is a speech @-@ edition system from the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported .
to display an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . the command for voice output is :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator written in &amp; Java . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ er@@ . voice output is then possible with one of the following command examples :
for the third example , the option must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example for using Free@@ T@@ TS . )
M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert German text into phon@@ em@@ es for M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax gladly swal@@ lows the last sign of the text so that an additional sign must be added . therefore , the complete command is more elaborate than in the other examples :
( Cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / / usr / local / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ sp@@ lay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written to a line . the option to send data as standard input must be enabled .
the voice output dem@@ on from &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
since the setting of the language generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use it as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the Settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to successfully use , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additional memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on the individual from your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application with which people who cannot speak can let text pass through the computer . it is a list of already spoken sentences which the user can always release .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language syn@@ thesizer contains . a voice syn@@ thesizer has to be installed on the computer .
for more detailed user documentation , see help : / k@@ mouth ( either enter this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , or start the help center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the speech output system from &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of the existing service that allows each application to read text about the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programmers ready to use their applications with T@@ TS capabilities .
reading texts ( or parts thereof ) in text editor &amp; posters ; even if &amp; posters ; embedded in other &amp; c ; applications .
speech output is used by the speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher program , which uses various background programs such as e@@ Spe@@ ak , festival , &amp; etc .
allows you to generate voice output on the command line ( or shell scripts ) using the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ utility .
in Z@@ UK@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up languages like Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up Language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the speech output service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible windows that offers T@@ TS services via &amp; d@@ bus ;
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setup of kt@@ ts@@ d over kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor , with which a text file can be read in whole or in part .
in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ts ; in the k@@ de @-@ accessibility mailing list . subscribe to the list above ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ accessibility .
before you can use it , you need to install speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ chers and set correctly . see also
at the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the cart@@ on card speaker is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the cart@@ on card is displayed . see .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up multiple variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up a speaker before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise the program speed dis@@ pat@@ chers are otherwise used as the standard speaker .
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer can be compared with several printer spo@@ ilers for the same printer .
if you click on the card tra@@ der in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the cart@@ on card will be displayed . this will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up yet .
all speakers already set up appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear in the top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if an application does not provide a speaker .
select a speaker from the list with one click of the mouse and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a speaker from the list with one click of the mouse and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select a speaker from the list with one mouse click , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
select a voice type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boy and girl &apos;s voice to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the Spo@@ kes@@ person tab . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; almost using it . go back to the tab General and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) to start the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; click on the map to create and manage text orders .
if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the language output system from &amp; k@@ de ; click the tab General to open this tab . here you can set some general options .
check this check box to activate the kt@@ ts ; this will start the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card wra@@ pper will be displayed and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the marker , will stop K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is terminated , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; next , if the voice output field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appears automatically when reading the control bar , it disappears again as soon as the reading is complete .
buttons in this series allow you to start , cancel , pause and record text orders .
the buttons in this row allow you to read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also change the speaker for one job .
click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be applied to all pages .
the ticket orders are only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the tab General and tick the voice output there ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser from &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . first , check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then select the text that is to be read and select the text in the Main Menu . after a short time , the voice output should start .
it is almost always reasonable to mark the desired text of a web page . you can skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML , pre@@ st@@ ressing and other invisible trademarks are read as well .
in &amp; Plac@@ ards ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read displayed text . first , check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then select the text that is to be read , and select the Text Editor in the Main Menu . then the voice output should start .
this also works if &amp; quot ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ not@@ fy is the &amp; k@@ de news system , noti@@ fying you about events laid down by you . you can read the text of this news also from &amp; kt@@ ts ; read Pre@@ vious .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program of &amp; k@@ de , you can set up various types of news . you can set up &amp; conversation ; for example , set up that you will be notified when a message appears in an I@@ RC channel in which your nick@@ name appears . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the I@@ RC message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ not@@ fy , a menu entry appears noti@@ fications in the Settings menu of this program . the choices here for K@@ not@@ fy vary depending on the application .
the k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml file which is part of the scope of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail and also the expression / local / in@@ box since it can be assumed in most cases as pres@@ upp@@ os@@ ed .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
filters are processed before being sent to the speech @-@ dispat@@ cher program . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation in order to replace spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the speech printer program works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; differenti@@ ates four types of text .
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the stopped jobs are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text .
news has the next highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; a long text read on a web page , you can go with &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also messages . read about it .
the rest are simple text orders . each order you receive from the cart@@ on card is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of an application that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts , which have no special ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queu@@ es except for the output of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , during &amp; kt@@ ts ; just reading such a screen , this output is stopped and terminated .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future , there are still further types of filters .
string inser@@ ters replace parts of a text with other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; is supplied with pre@@ defined string er@@ aser filters , which allow the creation of chat emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for re @-@ format@@ ting messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a more intel@@ li@@ gible form .
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use a X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . included in &amp; kt@@ ts ; include some X@@ S@@ LT files for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; included in the SS@@ ML .
with speaker selection filters , you can send orders to a speaker depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; for example , if you have set a female voice on the map player , you can read text from K@@ DE news about it . si@@ eh@@ . read about it .
each of these filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , the text will not be passed on to the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification is sent to kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the bottom . processing by the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not checked and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the next setup di@@ alogs are displayed .
you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison pattern for the creation of string replacement filters . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text is exchanged for the associated replacement text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it only has to differ from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column matches and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Re@@ place .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save the current list or delete . load a list from a file , the entries from the file are app@@ ended to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter will only be used if the speaker for the text order speaks one of the languages listed here . click the button to view a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l key at the click of the mouse .
if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the text comes from one of the given applications . you can enter multiple programs separately by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID of running programs is available with the q@@ d@@ bus program ; the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may only enter copy .
the string replacement filter will only be applied to the text when all conditions with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter apply if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . words must be del@@ im@@ ited on both sides by del@@ im@@ iters ( spaces ) .
in this manual , you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . but if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can paste it in the Add or Edit Pan@@ e ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the c@@ un@@ uti@@ ls package .
X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such conver@@ sions . but it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility need to be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is also sufficient .
the speaker selection filter allows you to send texts to a particular speaker , which is set up on the map , or to a speaker with certain characteristics . for example , you can specify that texts by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text passed to the filter , it is looking for a speaker for the text . the speaker will send the text to &amp; kt@@ ts by means of the speaker features that the program sends , and the properties of the speakers set up on the map card . with the speaker selection filter , you can over@@ ride the selected speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the given regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it by clicking on the button to get help when entering .
to get faster processing , try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the properties of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions described above , the speaker is selected that best matches the desired requirements . click the button on the right to show the dialog language selection .
use these buttons to save or load your subscri@@ ber settings or delete all settings .
the speaker selection filter will only be applied to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the Di@@ esen filter box if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the speech output API , from &amp; k@@ de ; with which programmers can give their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ D via &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , which uses the voice syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can be used .
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of the speech output API in &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice output services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the kt@@ ts@@ d program to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
text of the text for reading and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are more commands you can use . for a list of all commands , enter
open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; windows . only start kt@@ ts@@ d in one window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Um@@ form@@ er@@ filter , but when using the module for festival pages are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you must install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone to make s@@ able at all . you must also do that if you do not use this voice for reading websites . make sure that the program is installed x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c and can be found above the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors in the syn@@ thesizer , so that entire pro@@ positions are ski@@ pped or only Kau@@ der@@ wel@@ sch is spent . what can I do against it ?
first make sure the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be fixed by a string replacement filter .

K@@ T@@ TS works with any voice syn@@ thesizer which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console .
the list of languages mentioned above may be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , consult the description of the syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . also check the kt@@ ts website for information that is not yet contained in this manual .
the &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand for use of another syn@@ thesizer , contact the developer team .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not absolutely necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to compile and to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( Version 3.4 or later ) , including the k@@ deli@@ bs packages and the speech @-@ dispat@@ cher program .
if you get the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; get from the source code archive for c@@ de@@ dd or have downloaded the tar@@ ball currently generated every night , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before you use it , first check whether speech pat@@ chers work correctly with your voice syn@@ thesizer . to do so , you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ script SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of the program , which uses the speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher program . the kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr program should be developed in such a way that the speech @-@ dispens@@ ing tool is directly possible and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer required .
a long text is broken into single sentences . the user can go back , repeat , pause , pause , or cancel the output .
if an application contains text at &amp; kt@@ ts , it can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for output . for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose gender is female , it will be used , otherwise the best suitable speaker will be chosen . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker sel@@ ects , look at .
when you click Add Ad@@ or@@ ator on the Add button , and to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the map manager device will be shown . for example , the setup of the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below . details about the modules can be found below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you only have to enter festival .
select the character encoding for text that is handed over to festival . in case of votes you are familiar with , this setting will be done automatically . in general , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
these sli@@ ders allow you to adjust volume , voice speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some controllers and display them grey , the voice you select does not allow these settings to be selected .
some voices such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require several seconds to be loaded because of their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that the first set is syn@@ thes@@ ized faster ( with greater memory usage ) .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or forget to click App@@ ly ) . see .
if this check box is selected , the program window of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is displayed at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the symbol kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the symbol in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not work yet , it appears in the system area as soon as the TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to stop reading or otherwise control the reading .
here all orders in the queue are listed , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the precisely mach@@ ined set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the map player .
using the buttons in this row , you can pre @-@ select or return in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK all changes to the settings ( also on the other card cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts is not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de click on the audio card . see also .
here only text orders are performed and administered . output of screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . read more about the message types of kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled or compiled without support for the corresponding audio module , cannot load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de should be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . see also
set the speaker speed here . 50 . 50 % corresponds to about half and 200@@ mm , for example the double normal voice speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you must find out which device works with you . in doubt , select Def@@ ault .
on this card , you can set up special actions that are executed whenever the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four kinds of voice orders :
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . after the output of Screen Reader has been read , the queu@@ ed orders are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is subject to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
news has the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that pron@@ oun@@ ces messages . if you &amp; eg ; just reading a long text on a web page , you can go with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless welcome someone who is entering the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output to the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introductory sound and introductory message are active , the introductory sound is played before the introductory message .
the settings on this map are only valid for normal text orders . there are no special actions for messages , warnings , and screen readers to be interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; to read K@@ not@@ fy messages , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click al@@ erts .
tick this check box to enable reading &amp; k@@ de ; if this setting is not selected , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads no noti@@ fications .
if this setting is selected , al@@ erts for which a sound is played are from &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC message .
all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this sel@@ ector to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do when an event occurs . you have the following choices :
if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders here :
here you can enter the properties of the desired speaker . standard sel@@ ects the speaker , which appears in the list on the list of speakers as the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular application , the action will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application .
the event All noti@@ fications for the Application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can set the preced@@ ent al@@ erts as follows :
use the Save button to save the notification settings in a file . use the Lo@@ ad button to load stored settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all noti@@ fications are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains marks for controlling voice , speaking speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . also marks for controlling the pron@@ unciation of for example abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are present :
you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , since this is the standard voice , the festival is used in the output of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or tone in the festival configuration dialog is not set to 100@@ nbsp ; % , the SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .

there are two types of filters - normal filter and set limit detection filter ( SD@@ B filter ) .@@ S@@ B@@ Ds dup@@ licate text into single sentences . this can make &amp; kt@@ ts faster , since only the first set has to be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text order .
here you see the set limit recognition filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; a set limit recognition filter is set up automatically as default . you can change its settings or add more set limit recognition filters , but beginners will be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
the easiest way to learn how to set up the speaker selection by trying out . switch off the speaker selection and select text to read . click on the map menu , which speaker &amp; kt@@ ts ; select . to do this , you will need to have more than one speaker set up , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .

you can then stop or cancel text orders on the map sheet , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the standard set limit recognition filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything on this filter unless you know what you are doing .

S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers .
if you removed the normal stat@@ ute limit filter by default , you can paste it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c contained in &amp; kt@@ ts .

select the properties of the desired speaker here . if this feature doesn &apos;t matter , don &apos;t enter anything .
tick this check box if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also set several markers here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it is always treated as the primary feature . you will rarely use this property . the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language is before you know that a particular application text is sent in another language than the one in the working environment .
to use all the properties in the area speaker , which is most likely to delete the following , click on the standard speaker selection button and then use the speaker that best matches the following .
in this case 0 is for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) .

I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice .
in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / vocals , add the new voice . as a guide , you can use the other entries . if this is successful , please send a patch together with the file &amp; URL , where you found the voice , to the developers .

festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is revealed . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported .
you need to install at least one language . you will find help in the instructions provided with festival . if you want to read websites , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on the transfer .

this manual explains the installation and usage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , which enables administration of network interfaces , routing , and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a series of system and desktop settings using a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after installation a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center will be displayed . the network settings module ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting the k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in the &amp; K@@ Menu ;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .com ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured , thus &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all indicates and allows setting of network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed for installing &amp; Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files , according to the kernel version :
the Network Settings module is loaded when the network settings option is selected at the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index . when starting the module network settings , this attempts to automatically detect the platform used on the system .
if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which is best suited to the distribution and the Rel@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and . by marking the setting non @-@ recur@@ sively the setting can be set permanently . next start of network settings , this selection will be set automatically .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . before , all options are displayed gray , meaning the settings can only be viewed , the change is not possible . in system management mode , you can enter the system administrator mode at the right lower end of the module . it is required to enter the password .
in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three tab@@ s :
the Network Interface tab is used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed from the Network Interface network :
the settings displayed can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button interface ... in the dialog Device can be edited .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options .
the automatic mode sel@@ ects the TCP / IP settings from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings are executed for the system at the same time with the start of the system services . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information for each system start , so no further adjustment is required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
with the manual selection Manual can be done without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mask , the sub@@ net mask must be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . ping in the &amp; Con@@ sole ; you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be enabled or disabled depending on your needs . switching on an out@@ dated network device is enabled by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
depending on your needs , network devices can be activated or switched off . off @-@ off of an activated network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
establishes the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net that communic@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with hosts in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected .
a machine with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer requires ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS solves this name in an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the host name resolution calcul@@ ator allows an easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or modified . DNS records can be ranked by selecting an entry or up or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the Buttons Up or Down in the priority .
by clicking the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will display the New nam@@ eser@@ ver dialog .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... It will display the Edit dialog .
the list especially known calcul@@ ator describes host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily when bo@@ oting , if no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS server .
usually the list contains a list of particularly well @-@ known machines , which support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this still in the test version of IP should replace version 4 in future .
enter the IP address of the familiar computer and click Add ... The Add New Ali@@ as dialog will be displayed .
enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button . if the known machine has multiple alias names , press de button Add several times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a particularly well @-@ known computer from the list and select Edit ... The dialog box to edit is displayed .
you can perform one of the following tasks , then click OK to update the list of the static hosts .
the settings made in the Network settings module are not immediately effective in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command must be set in a &amp; console .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the ready @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it &apos;s easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution can be used .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; in addition , the development packages are required with libraries and others .
this is recommended only to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do so .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , in the second section all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf are discussed ; configur@@ able configuration files are discussed .
this section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC is conveyed in a small ( home ) network .
currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 6 has never found any great distribution . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . therefore , this description concentr@@ ates on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is knowing the IP address of a network interface . in external networks , at the &amp; eg ; Work@@ place , the network administrator is the point of contact with a valid IP address or , if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address can not simply be chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up a small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , so their use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a gateway .
for smaller networks , addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own host ) . the default route is required for IP forwarding .
the 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 network address is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally the address is 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 of its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
this section contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections so it won &apos;t be surprised if there is no other content than specified in the case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE . another state than expected can therefore occur .

&amp; k@@ dat ; h@@ ops the band back and reads the pre@@ st@@ ressing information of the tape . detects &amp; k@@ dat ; don &apos;t know if the tape is on the tape , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted .
detects &amp; k@@ dat ; the preview , searches for the right index on your disk . if it cannot be found , you will be asked if the band index is to be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the icon for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been incorporated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched through the entry details of the tape .
before casting the belt , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; there is a change in the symbol for the tape to recognize that the integration for the tape is loos@@ ened and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without any danger .
before a tape from &amp; k@@ dat can be used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ;
a band type must be format@@ ted before you can use data to save data . if your tape drive requires a tape to be format@@ ted before use , this must happen before you can be format@@ ted by the tape from &amp; k@@ dat ; Flo@@ ppy tape drives usually require format@@ ting of tape , but DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the band name and the capacity moves &amp; k@@ dat ; proceed with the format@@ ting of the tape . all data on the tape are lost in the process ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically included and is ready for use .
before you start the backup process , you need to select the backup files . this can happen in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is backed up .
mark a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile will be backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right click on the local file tree and select Save in the Save menu ...
once the backup has been initiated , the dialog opens up for backup . in this dialog you can check again the selected files and change the backup settings .
if you confirm the settings , the dialog box will be backed up . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the time remaining .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
right click in any of the archives and select the menu item .
once the test process has been started , the dialog appears for verification . in this dialog , you can check your selection again and change the working folder for checking .
if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog appears to check . this dialog shows the progress of the review process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can re@@ direct the restore , the files that should be restored must be marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives associated with the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select the Rest@@ ore menu in the menu .
once the restore process has been started , the dialog appears for restoration . in this dialog , you can re @-@ check your selection and change the working folder for recovery .
if you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialog will restart . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re @-@ create the band index file using the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this volume . you can create the index in two ways from the band :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current job folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder .
for all files listed under backup files , only the files in it are backed up that are located on the same file system as the folder . folders that are on other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be entered separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar regardless of the other .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snapshot file before tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; lt ; lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can be set up via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the full path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must point to the non @-@ re@@ winding variant of the tape device .
if this setting is active , transm@@ ited &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is included , the command mt load to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; lock the tape drive at the tape drive . it may not work with all tape drives .
if the option is enabled , the tape is automatically dis@@ car@@ ded when releasing the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; do not use this option with Flo@@ ppy @-@ Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; to change the hardware block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you need to communicate the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only show a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are as follows :
the band ID . the format of this string is the host@@ name : seconds , where the name is the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time the tape has been format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file folder .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be directly edited with &amp; GNU , tar . even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a f@@ use tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is included .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; ist ein &amp; k@@ de ; Viewer for System Lo@@ gs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system supports the different protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access for example to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of log files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system leaves the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log , experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system log ; hence , attempts to provide some advanced features to filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shots , &amp; k@@ system log ; functions available to easily filter and sort the single log lines of a log file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the main protocol file of the system - the system log - to open . if you don &apos;t see this , and it opens instead of a small message window , you will probably not have started with system administrator privileges . the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the directory / var / log , for which normal users usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criterion , or according to set strings . in the default setting , the list of log rows will be changed automatically , so that only the log rows will be displayed . then a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns .
you can also select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term is then matched only with the entries in the corresponding column . for example , in the log file system log , select the column process , and additionally , in the filter bar , indicate the name of a process , so you will show you &amp; k@@ system log ; all protocol lines sent or created by this process .
this option is activated in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important minutes lines . log lines of step errors are indicated with a more eye @-@ catching color than log lines of level indication . the colored representation of log lines can be turned off .
if you want to display only certain process ( for example in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this may , for example , be useful if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server .
in addition , you can enable the option To jump to new lines in the main window context menu , in order to display all the new log lines added .
&amp; k@@ system log ; allows you to view multiple log files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub @-@ windows . once you have selected a sub @-@ window , select a log to display in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. You can find further information about the Sour@@ ces of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system log ; you can also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; archive
welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and named as well ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
the V In@@ it system is rapidly becoming the standard for program start @-@ ups when running the system in the &amp; Linux world . this is because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it .
I will not go into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is below / s@@ bin and not / etc . this is important because maybe someone might attempt to convert a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and re @-@ format@@ ting . that &apos;s why you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for any system service you want to run when you boot the system or when switching to another running level . system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is started only once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
the r@@ c.@@ local should be included in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most of the systems have this file , even if there is actually not much use for it . you can also set up a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something when you boot , which has to do with the serial port .
the kernel searches in different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one it finds .
the default Run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point , you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change that , then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have confused something , then you can fix it by re@@ launching the system and exec@@ uting the following :
but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how does it start and stops in@@ it system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually run these scripts from hand to command line :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the file contains a K , the script will be called with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the start of the argument .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server running level that only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; running . in addition , I could also have a user run@@ level , that &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc .
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult , because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is easy to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six Run@@ ning levels to start it at this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ level@@ ing or modify the position within a level by pulling it elsewhere . this will only happen if you remove an entry from the range of available system services .
note : entries are moved if you move them into a new area . to copy them only to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste into the target area -- even if the same entry has existed previously in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can again try to insert the system service .
note : currently there is no way to restore entries that have been thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab key to activate the different working ranges ( Avail@@ able system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous ones .
to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it with cutting to the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired Run@@ level with In@@ sert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or name of an entry manually , press the input button to change the properties dialog . use the tab key to change the properties dialog . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the danger of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they will be recovered from &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; otherwise they will be saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ thous@@ es , and now the machine starts to re@@ boot . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start the single user mode . then edit the / etc / in@@ it@@ tab file and change the default Run@@ ning level to a reasonable value ( 3 should be fine ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for running under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distri@@ butions . please refer to the details in the distribution manual .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using another distribution , please check if all configuration files are present , which are required by the system service ( and also if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and ht@@ tp@@ d ) are simply complete without message if their configuration files are not present or in@@ correctly set up .
the importance of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even vary from version to version . if you are using any other distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ ning level so that they can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter Adap@@ tation from &amp; k@@ user ;
after you &apos;ve made changes you need to save them . either use the corresponding tool@@ bar icon or the Save in File menu .
the main window consists of two cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog user and group properties .
some flash@@ cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only if you have enabled wild@@ cards ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card card will be created , where you can configure individual settings . other flash@@ cards will appear if Shadow Pass@@ words or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD Uni@@ xes .
the card password management card will appear if Shadow Pass@@ words or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD Uni@@ xes .
this card @-@ card only appears if for at least one fil@@ esystem space limitation ( quot@@ a ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) .
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current file system is selected using the array fil@@ esystem with space restriction .
the cart@@ on map groups inform about the group depen@@ dencies of the selected user . the standard group to which the user belongs can be found in the Field Prim@@ ary Group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field .
the group dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the user or group or click the Add button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group functions an@@ alog@@ ously .
with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO boot@@ manager , add , remove and change the boot password , change time to boot from the standard operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more .
